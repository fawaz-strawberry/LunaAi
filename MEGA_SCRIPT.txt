NAME: LUKE
Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,
old buddy, do you read me?

NAME: HAN
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

NAME: LUKE
Well, I finished my circle.  I
don't pick up any life readings.

NAME: HAN
There isn't enough life on this
ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed, I'm going
back.

NAME: LUKE
Right.  I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.  I want to check
it out.  It won't take long.

NAME: LUKE
Hey, steady girl.  What's the
matter?  You smell something?

NAME: LUKE
Aaargh!

NAME: HAN
Chewie!

NAME: HAN
All right, don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back and give you
a hand.

NAME: RIEEKAN
Solo?

NAME: HAN
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll
know if anything comes around.

NAME: RIEEKAN
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

NAME: HAN
No.  He's checking out a meteorite
that hit near him.

NAME: RIEEKAN
(indicates radar
screen)
With all the meteor activity in this
system, it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

NAME: HAN
General, I've got to leave.  I
can't stay anymore.

NAME: RIEEKAN
I'm sorry to hear that.

NAME: HAN
Well, there's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
I'm a dead man.

NAME: RIEEKAN
A death mark's not an easy thing
to live with.  You're a good
fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

NAME: HAN
Thank you, General.

NAME: HAN
Well, Your Highness, I guess this
is it.

NAME: LEIA
That's right.

NAME: HAN
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

NAME: LEIA
Han!

NAME: HAN
Yes, Your Highnessness?

NAME: LEIA
I thought you decided to stay.

NAME: HAN
Well, the bounty hunter we ran
into on Ord Mantell changed my
mind.

NAME: LEIA
Han, we need you!

NAME: HAN
We?

NAME: LEIA
Yes.

NAME: HAN
Oh, what about you need?

NAME: LEIA
I need?  I don't know what you're
talking about.

NAME: HAN
(shakes his head,
fed up)
You probably don't.

NAME: LEIA
And what precisely am I supposed
to know?

NAME: HAN
Come on!  You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about
me.

NAME: LEIA
Yes.  You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader...

NAME: HAN
No!  That's not it.  Come on.
Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

NAME: LEIA
You're imagining things.

NAME: HAN
Am I?  Then why are you following
me?  Afraid I was going to leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

NAME: LEIA
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

NAME: HAN
I can arrange that.  You could use
a good kiss!

NAME: THREEPIO
Don't try to blame me.  I didn't
ask you to turn on the thermal
heater.  I merely commented that it
was freezing in the princess'
chamber.  But it's supposed to be
freezing.  How are we going to dry
out all her clothes?  I really don't
know.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, switch off.

NAME: HAN
Why do you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here
and you pull both of these.

NAME: THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir.

NAME: HAN
Put them back together right now.

NAME: THREEPIO
Might I have a word with you,
please?

NAME: HAN
What do you want?

NAME: THREEPIO
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
She's been trying to get you on
the communicator.

NAME: HAN
I turned it off.  I don't want to
talk to her.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.  He hasn't come
back yet.  She doesn't know where he
is.

NAME: HAN
I don't know where he is.

NAME: THREEPIO
Nobody knows where he is.

NAME: HAN
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

NAME: THREEPIO
Well, uh, you see...

NAME: HAN
Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

NAME: THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

NAME: DECK OFFICER
Yes, sir?

NAME: HAN
Do you know where Commander
Skywalker is?

NAME: DECK OFFICER
I haven't seen him.  It's possible
he came in through the south entrance.

NAME: HAN
It's possible?  Why don't you go
find out?  It's getting dark out there.

NAME: DECK OFFICER
Yes, sir.

NAME: THREEPIO
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire
what's going on?

NAME: HAN
Why not?

NAME: THREEPIO
Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,
let's find Princess Leia.  Between
ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

NAME: DECK OFFICER
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
come in through the south entrance.
He might have forgotten to check in.

NAME: HAN
Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

NAME: DECK OFFICER
Not yet.  We're having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.

NAME: HAN
Then we'll have to go out on
Tauntauns.

NAME: DECK OFFICER
Sir, the temperature's dropping too
rapidly.

NAME: HAN
That's right.  And my friends out
in it.

NAME: ASSISTANT OFFICER
I'll cover sector twelve.  Have
com-control set screen alpha.

NAME: DECK OFFICER
Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
reach the first marker.

NAME: HAN
Then I'll see you in hell!

NAME: THREEPIO
You must come along now, Artoo.
There's really nothing more we can
do.  And my joints are freezing up.

NAME: THREEPIO
Don't say thing like that!  Of
course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll
be quite all right.

NAME: LIEUTENANT
Sir, all the patrols are in.
There's still no contact from
Skywalker or Solo.

NAME: THREEPIO
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,
although he does admit that his own
range is far too weak to abandon
all hope.

NAME: DERLIN
Your Highness, there's nothing
more we can do tonight.  The shield
doors must be closed.

NAME: DERLIN
Close the doors.

NAME: LIEUTENANT
Yes, sir.

NAME: THREEPIO
Artoo says the chances of survival
are seven hundred seventy-five...
to one.

NAME: THREEPIO
Actually, Artoo has been known to
make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry
about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll
be all right.  He's quite clever,
you know... for a human being.

NAME: BEN
Luke... Luke.

NAME: LUKE
Ben?

NAME: BEN
You will go to the Dagobah system.

NAME: LUKE
Dagobah system?

NAME: BEN
There you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me.

NAME: LUKE
Ben... Ben.

NAME: HAN
Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.

NAME: HAN
Not much time.

NAME: LUKE
Ben... Ben...

NAME: HAN
Hang on, kid.

NAME: LUKE
Dagobah system...

NAME: HAN
(reeling from the
odor)
Whew...

NAME: LUKE
Dagobah...

NAME: HAN
This may smell bad, kid...

NAME: LUKE
Yoda...

NAME: HAN
...but it will keep you warm...
til I get the shelter built.
(struggling to get
Luke inside the
carcass)
Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

NAME: ZEV
Echo Base... I've got something!  Not
much, but it could be a life form.

NAME: ZEV
This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue
Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

NAME: HAN
(filtered over
Zev's receiver)
Good morning.  Nice of you guys
to drop by.

NAME: ZEV
Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I
found them.  Repeat, I found them.

NAME: THREEPIO
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

NAME: THREEPIO
Artoo expresses his relief, also.

NAME: HAN
How are you feeling, kid?  You
don't look so bad to me.  In
fact, you look strong enough to
pull the ears off a Gundark.

NAME: LUKE
Thanks to you.

NAME: HAN
That's two you owe me, junior.

NAME: HAN
Well your Worship, looks like
you managed to keep me around for
a little while longer.

NAME: LEIA
I had nothing to do with it.  General
Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for
any ships to leave the system until
we've activated the energy shield.

NAME: HAN
That's a good story.  I think you
just can't bear to let a gorgeous
guy like me out of your sight.

NAME: LEIA
I don't know where you get your
delusions, laser brain.

NAME: HAN
Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you
didn't see us alone in the south
passage.

NAME: HAN
She expressed her true feelings
for me.

NAME: LEIA
My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
herder!

NAME: HAN
Who's scruffy-looking?
I must have hit pretty close to
the mark to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

NAME: LEIA
Why, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet?

NAME: ANNOUNCER
Headquarters personnel, report to
command center.

NAME: HAN
Take it easy.

NAME: THREEPIO
Excuse us, please.

NAME: RIEEKAN
Princess... we have a visitor.

NAME: RIEEKAN
We've picked up something outside
the base in zone twelve, moving
east.

NAME: SENIOR CONTROLLER
It's metal.

NAME: LEIA
Then it couldn't be one of those
creatures that attacked Luke.

NAME: HAN
It could be a speeder, one of ours.

NAME: SENIOR CONTROLLER
No.  Wait - there's something very
weak coming through.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.  This signal
is not used by the Alliance.  It
could be an Imperial code.

NAME: HAN
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

NAME: RIEEKAN
Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to
station three-eight.

NAME: HAN
Afraid there's not much left.

NAME: LEIA
What was it?

NAME: HAN
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
it that hard.  It must have had a
self-destruct.

NAME: LEIA
An Imperial probe droid.

NAME: HAN
It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here.

NAME: RIEEKAN
We'd better start the evacuation.

NAME: PIETT
Admiral.

NAME: OZZEL
Yes, Captain

NAME: PIETT
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment from
a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

NAME: OZZEL
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.  I want proof,
not leads!

NAME: PIETT
The visuals indicate life readings.

NAME: OZZEL
It could mean anything.  If we
followed every lead...

NAME: PIETT
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed
to be devoid of human forms.

NAME: VADER
You found something?

NAME: PIETT
Yes, my lord.

NAME: VADER
(studying the image
on the console screen)
That's it.  The Rebels are there.

NAME: OZZEL
My lord, there are so many uncharted
settlements.  It could be smugglers,
it could be...

NAME: VADER
That is the system.  And I'm sure
Skywalker is with them.  Set your
course for the Hoth system.  General
Veers, prepare you men.

NAME: REBEL CAPTAIN
Groups seven and ten will stay
behind to fly the speeders.  As
soon as each transport is loaded,
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch.

NAME: REBEL FIGHTER
Right, sir.

NAME: HAN
(into comlink, to
Chewie)
Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off!
Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

NAME: MEDICAL DROID
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

NAME: LUKE
Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There's plenty of time to get the
smaller modules on the transports.

NAME: MEDICAL DROID
Take care, sir.

NAME: LUKE
Thanks.

NAME: LUKE
Chewie, take care of yourself,
okay?

NAME: HAN
Hi, kid.
There's got to be a reason for
it.  Check it at the other end.
Wait a second.
You all right?

NAME: LUKE
Yeah.

NAME: HAN
Be careful.

NAME: LUKE
You, too.

NAME: CONTROLLER
General, there's a fleet of Star
Destroyers coming out of hyperspace
in sector four.

NAME: RIEEKAN
Reroute all power to the energy
shield.  We've got to hold them till
all transports are away.  Prepare
for ground assault.

NAME: VADER
What is it, General?

NAME: VEERS
My lord, the fleet has moves out
of light-speed.  Com-Scan has
detected an energy field protecting
an area around the sixth planet of
the Hoth system.  The field is
strong enough to deflect any
bombardment.

NAME: VADER
The Rebels are alerted to our
presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out
of light-speed too close to the
system.

NAME: VEERS
He felt surprise was wiser...

NAME: VADER
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops for a
surface attack.

NAME: VEERS
Yes, my lord.

NAME: OZZEL
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
out of light-speed, and we're
preparing to... Aaagh!

NAME: VADER
You have failed me for the last
time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

NAME: PIETT
Yes, my lord.

NAME: VADER
Make ready to land out troops beyond
the energy shield and deploy the
fleet so that nothing gets off that
system.  You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

NAME: PIETT
Thank you, Lord Vader.

NAME: LEIA
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.  The heavy
transport ships will leave as
soon as they're loaded.  Only two
fighter escorts per ship.  The
energy shield can only be opened
for a short time, so you'll have
to stay very close to your transports.

NAME: HOBBIE
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

NAME: LEIA
The ion cannon will fire several
shots to make sure that any enemy
ships will be out of your flight
path.  When you've gotten past the
energy shield, proceed directly to
the rendezvous point.  Understood?

NAME: PILOTS
Right.  Okay.

NAME: LEIA
Good luck.

NAME: DERLIN
Okay.  Everyone to your stations.
Let's go!

NAME: RIEEKAN
Their primary target will be the
power generators.  Prepare to
open the shield.

NAME: CONTROLLER
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into
our sector.

NAME: CAPTAIN
Good.  Our first catch of the day.

NAME: WOMAN CONTROLLER
Stand by, ion control... Fire!

NAME: ANNOUNCER
The first transport is away.

NAME: DACK
Feeling all right, sir?

NAME: LUKE
Just like new, Dack.  How about
you?

NAME: DACK
Right now I feel like I could take
on the whole Empire myself.

NAME: LUKE
(quietly, strapping
in)
I know what you mean.

NAME: TRENCH OFFICER
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

NAME: TRENCH OFFICER
We have spotted Imperial walkers!

NAME: CONTROLLER
Imperial walkers on the north
ridge.

NAME: LUKE
Echo station Five-Seven.  We're
on our way.

NAME: LUKE
All right, boys, keep tight now.

NAME: DACK
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

NAME: LUKE
Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern
delta.  Go now!

NAME: LUKE
All right, I'm coming in.

NAME: LUKE
Hobbie, you still with me?

NAME: LUKE
That armor's too strong for
blasters.

NAME: LUKE
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance of
stopping them.
All right, stand by, Dack.

NAME: DACK
Luke, we've got a malfunction in
fire control.  I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

NAME: LUKE
Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get
ready to fire that tow cable.

NAME: LUKE
Dack?  Dack!

NAME: VEERS
Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the
main power generator.  The shield
will be down in moments.  You may
start your landing.

NAME: LUKE
Rogue Three.

NAME: WEDGE
Copy, Rogue Leader

NAME: LUKE
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll
have to make this shot.  I'll cover
for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow
me on the next pass.

NAME: WEDGE
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

NAME: LUKE
Steady, Rogue Two

NAME: WEDGE
Activate harpoon.

NAME: WEDGE
Good shot, Janson.

NAME: WEDGE
One more pass.

NAME: JANSON
Coming around.  Once more.

NAME: JANSON
Once more.

NAME: JANSON
Cable out!  Let her go!

NAME: WEDGE
Detach cable.

NAME: JANSON
Cable detached.

NAME: TRENCH OFFICER
Come on!

NAME: WEDGE
Whooha!  That got him!

NAME: LUKE
I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

NAME: RIEEKAN
I don't think we can protect two
transports at a time.

NAME: LEIA
It's risky, but we can't hold out
much longer.  We have no choice.

NAME: RIEEKAN
Launch patrols.

NAME: LEIA
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

NAME: HAN
No, no!  No!  This one goes there,
that one goes there.  Right?

NAME: THREEPIO
Artoo, you take good care of
Master Luke now, understand?  And
... do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

NAME: VEERS
All troops will debark for ground
assault.  Prepare to target the
main generator.

NAME: LUKE
Rogue Two, are you all right?

NAME: ZEV
Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

NAME: LUKE
We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.

NAME: ZEV
Coming around.

NAME: LUKE
Watch that cross fire, boys.

NAME: ZEV
Set for position three.
Steady.

NAME: LUKE
Stay tight and low.

NAME: LUKE
Hobbie, I've been hit!

NAME: HAN
You all right?

NAME: LEIA
Why are you still here?

NAME: HAN
I heard the command center had
been hit.

NAME: LEIA
You got your clearance to leave.

NAME: HAN
Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First
I'm going to get you to your ship.

NAME: THREEPIO
Your Highness, we must take this
last transport.  It's our only hope.

NAME: LEIA
Send all troops in sector twelve
to the south slope to protect the
fighters.

NAME: ANNOUNCER
Imperial troops have entered the
base.

NAME: HAN
Come on... that's it.

NAME: LEIA
Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports!

NAME: HEAD CONTROLLER
K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh!  Wait for me!

NAME: OFFICER
Begin retreat!

NAME: SECOND OFFICER
Fall back!

NAME: VEERS
Distance to power generators?

NAME: PILOT
One-seven, decimal two-eight.

NAME: VEERS
Target.  Maximum fire power.

NAME: HAN
Transport, this is Solo.  Better
take off - I can't get to you.
I'll get the princess out on the
Falcon.

NAME: THREEPIO
But... but... but... where are
you going?  Uh... come back!!

NAME: THREEPIO
Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

NAME: THREEPIO
How typical.

NAME: HAN
Come on.

NAME: HAN
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're
going to be a permanent resident!

NAME: THREEPIO
Wait!  Wait!

NAME: HAN
How's this?

NAME: LEIA
Would it helped if I got out and
pushed?

NAME: HAN
It might.

NAME: THREEPIO
Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,
might I suggest that you...

NAME: THREEPIO
It can wait.

NAME: LEIA
This bucket of bolts is never going
to get us past that blockade.

NAME: HAN
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

NAME: HAN
Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

NAME: HAN
See?

NAME: LEIA
Someday you're going to be wrong,
and I hope I'm there to see it.

NAME: HAN
Punch it!

NAME: LUKE
Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

NAME: WEDGE
Good luck, Luke.  See you at
the rendezvous.

NAME: LUKE
Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,
we're going.

NAME: LUKE
There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
I'm just setting a new course.

NAME: LUKE
We're not going to regroup with
the others.

NAME: LUKE
We're going to the Dagobah system.

NAME: LUKE
Yes, Artoo?

NAME: LUKE
That's all right.  I'd like to
keep it on manual control for a
while.

NAME: HAN
I saw them!  I saw them!

NAME: LEIA
Saw what?

NAME: HAN
Star Destroyers, two of them,
coming right at us.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

NAME: HAN
Shut him up or shut him down!
Check the deflector shield!

NAME: HAN
Oh, great.  Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

NAME: INT. STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen
veering to the left.

NAME: IMPERIAL OFFICER
Take evasive action!

NAME: HAN
Prepare to make the jump to light-
speed.

NAME: THREEPIO
But, sir!

NAME: LEIA
They're getting closer!

NAME: HAN
(with a gleam in his
eye)
Oh yeah?  Watch this.

NAME: LEIA
Watch what?

NAME: HAN
I think we're in trouble.

NAME: THREEPIO
If I may say so, sir, I noticed
earlier that the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.  It's
impossible to go to light-speed!

NAME: HAN
We're in trouble!

NAME: HAN
Horizontal boosters...!
Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's
not it.
Bring me the hydrospanners!

NAME: HAN
I don't know how we're going to
get out of this one.

NAME: HAN
Oww!  Chewie!

NAME: HAN
That was no laser blast!  Something
hit us.

NAME: LEIA
Han, get up here!

NAME: HAN
Come on, Chewie!

NAME: LEIA
Asteroids!

NAME: HAN
Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
one.

NAME: LEIA
What are you doing?  You're not
actually going into an asteroid
field?

NAME: HAN
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

NAME: LEIA
You don't have to do this to
impress me.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is
approximately three thousand, seven
hundred and twenty to one.

NAME: HAN
Never tell me the odds!

NAME: HAN
You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake; well, this
could be it, sweetheart.

NAME: LEIA
I take it back.  We're going to
get pulverized if we stay out here
much longer.

NAME: HAN
I'm not going to argue with that.

NAME: THREEPIO
Pulverized?

NAME: HAN
I'm going in closer to one of
those big ones.

NAME: LEIA
Closer?

NAME: THREEPIO
Closer?!

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, this is suicide!

NAME: HAN
There.  That looks pretty good.

NAME: LEIA
What looks pretty good?

NAME: HAN
Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

NAME: THREEPIO
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are
we going?

NAME: LEIA
I hope you know what you're doing.

NAME: HAN
Yeah, me too.

NAME: LUKE
Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

NAME: LUKE
No, I'm not going to change my
mind about this.
I'm not picking up any cities or
technology.  Massive life-form
readings, though.  There's something
alive down there...

NAME: LUKE
Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe
for droids.

NAME: LUKE
I know, I know!  All the scopes are
dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just
hang on, I'm going to start the
landing cycle...

NAME: LUKE
No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll
have a look around.

NAME: LUKE
Artoo?

NAME: LUKE
Artoo!  Where are you?

NAME: LUKE
Artoo!  You be more careful.

NAME: LUKE
Artoo - that way!

NAME: LUKE
Artoo!

NAME: LUKE
Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come
on.  You're lucky you don't taste
very good.  Anything broken?

NAME: LUKE
If you're saying coming here was
a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we
doing here?  It's like... something
out of a dream, or, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

NAME: VADER
Yes, Admiral?

NAME: PIETT
Our ships have sighted the
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But...
it has entered an asteroid field
and we cannot risk...

NAME: VADER
Asteroids do not concern me,
Admiral.  I want that ship and
not excuses.

NAME: PIETT
Yes, lord.

NAME: HAN
I'm going to shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but... does that include shutting
me down, too?

NAME: HAN
No, I need you to talk to the
Falcon, find out what's wrong with
the hyperdrive.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, it's quite possible this
asteroid is not entirely stable.

NAME: HAN
Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're
here to tell us these things.  Chewie,
take the professor in the back and
plug him into the hyperdrive.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh!  Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.  After
all, I'm only trying to do my job
in the most...

NAME: LEIA
Let go.

NAME: HAN
Sshh!

NAME: LEIA
Let go, please.

NAME: HAN
Don't get excited.

NAME: LEIA
Captain, being held by you isn't
quite enough to get me excited.

NAME: HAN
Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't
got time for anything else.

NAME: LUKE
Ready for some power?  Okay.
Let's see now.  Put that in
there.  There you go.

NAME: LUKE
Now all I have to do is find this
Yoda... if he even exists.

NAME: LUKE
Still... there's something familiar
about this place.  I feel like...
I don't know...

NAME: STRANGE VOICE
Feel like what?

NAME: LUKE
(looking at the
creature)
Like we're being watched!

NAME: CREATURE
Away with your weapon!  I mean
you no harm.

NAME: CREATURE
I am wondering, why are you here?

NAME: LUKE
I'm looking for someone.

NAME: CREATURE
Looking?  Found someone, you have,
I would say, hmmm?

NAME: LUKE
(Trying to keep from
smiling)
Right.

NAME: CREATURE
Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

NAME: LUKE
I don't think so.  I'm looking
for a great warrior.

NAME: CREATURE
Ahhh!  A great warrior.
(laughs and shakes
his head)
Wars not make one great.

NAME: LUKE
Put that down.  Hey!  That's my
dinner!

NAME: CREATURE
How you get so big, eating food
of this kind?

NAME: LUKE
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would,
but we can't, so why don't you just...

NAME: CREATURE
Aww, cannot get your ship out?

NAME: LUKE
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're
making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

NAME: CREATURE
(retreating with
the lamp)
Mine!  Or I will help you not.

NAME: LUKE
I don't want your help.  I want
my lamp back.  I'll need it to
get out of this slimy mudhole.

NAME: CREATURE
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

NAME: CREATURE
Ah, ah, ah!

NAME: LUKE
Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

NAME: CREATURE
Mine!  Mine!

NAME: LUKE
Artoo!

NAME: CREATURE
Mine!

NAME: CREATURE
Mine!

NAME: LUKE
Now will you move along, little
fella?  We're got a lot of work
to do.

NAME: CREATURE
No!  No, no!  Stay and help you,
I will.
Find your friend, hmm?

NAME: LUKE
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

NAME: CREATURE
Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You
seek Yoda.

NAME: LUKE
You know him?

NAME: CREATURE
Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
Come.  Good food.  Come.

NAME: CREATURE
Come, come.

NAME: LUKE
Stay here and watch after the
camp, Artoo.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, where is Artoo when I need
him?

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate, but it
has the most peculiar dialect.  I
believe, sir, it says that the
power coupling on the negative
axis has been polarized.  I'm
afraid you'll have to replace it.

NAME: HAN
Well, of course I'll have to replace
it.

NAME: HAN
Here!  And Chewie...

NAME: HAN
... I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

NAME: HAN
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only
trying to help.

NAME: LEIA
Would you please stop calling me
that?

NAME: HAN
Sure, Leia.

NAME: LEIA
Oh, you make it so difficult
sometimes.

NAME: HAN
I do, I really do.  You could be
a little nicer, though.
(he watches her
reaction)
Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you
think I'm all right.

NAME: LEIA
Occasionally...
(a little smile,
haltingly)
... when you aren't acting like
a scoundrel.

NAME: HAN
Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like
the sound of that.

NAME: LEIA
Stop that.

NAME: HAN
Stop what?

NAME: LEIA
Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

NAME: HAN
My hands are dirty, too.  What
are you afraid of?

NAME: LEIA
(looking right
into his eyes)
Afraid?

NAME: HAN
You're trembling.

NAME: LEIA
I'm not trembling.

NAME: HAN
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in
your life.

NAME: LEIA
I happen to like nice men.

NAME: HAN
I'm a nice man.

NAME: LEIA
No, you're not.  You're...

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, sir!  I've isolated the
reverse power flux coupling.

NAME: HAN
Thank you.  Thank you very much.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

NAME: NEEDA
... and that, Lord Vader, was the
last time they appeared in any of
our scopes.  Considering the amount
of damage we've sustained, they
must have been destroyed.

NAME: VADER
No, Captain, they're alive.  I
want every ship available to
sweep the asteroid field until
they are found.

NAME: PIETT
Lord Vader.

NAME: VADER
Yes, Admiral, what is it?

NAME: PIETT
The Emperor commands you make
contact with him.

NAME: VADER
Move the ship out of the asteroid
field so that we can send a clear
transmission.

NAME: PIETT
Yes, my lord.

NAME: VADER
What is thy bidding, my master?

NAME: EMPEROR
There is a great disturbance in
the Force.

NAME: VADER
I have felt it.

NAME: EMPEROR
We have a new enemy - Luke
Skywalker.

NAME: VADER
Yes, my master.

NAME: EMPEROR
He could destroy us.

NAME: VADER
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no
longer help him.

NAME: EMPEROR
The Force is strong with him.  The
son of Skywalker must not become a
Jedi.

NAME: VADER
If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally.

NAME: EMPEROR
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great
asset.  Can it be done?

NAME: VADER
He will join us or die, my
master.

NAME: LUKE
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
I just don't understand why we
can't see Yoda now.

NAME: CREATURE
Patience!  For the Jedi it is
time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.
Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

NAME: LUKE
How far away is Yoda?  Will it
take us long to get there?

NAME: CREATURE
Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
(tasting food from
the pot)
Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you
become Jedi?  Hm?

NAME: LUKE
Mostly because of my father, I
guess.

NAME: CREATURE
Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi
was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

NAME: LUKE
Oh, come on.  How could you know
my father?  You don't even know
who I am.
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
here.  We're wasting our time.

NAME: CREATURE
I cannot teach him.  The boy has
no patience.

NAME: BEN'S VOICE
He will learn patience.

NAME: YODA
Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

NAME: BEN'S VOICE
Was I any different when you
taught me?

NAME: YODA
Hah.  He is not ready.

NAME: LUKE
Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I
can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm
ready.

NAME: YODA
Ready, are you?  What know you
of ready?  For eight hundred years
have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel
will I keep on who is to be trained!
A Jedi must have the deepest
commitment, the most serious mind.
(to the invisible
Ben, indicating Luke)
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away...
to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was.
Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.
Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!
A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless!

NAME: BEN'S VOICE
So was I, if you'll remember.

NAME: YODA
He is too old.  Yes, too old to
begin the training.

NAME: LUKE
But I've learned so much.

NAME: YODA
Will he finished what he begins?

NAME: LUKE
I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

NAME: YODA
(turns slowly toward
him)
Oh, you will be.  You will be.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

NAME: HAN
I'm not really interested in your
opinion, Threepio.

NAME: LEIA
There's something out there.

NAME: HAN
Where?

NAME: LEIA
Outside, in the cave.

NAME: THREEPIO
There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

NAME: HAN
I'm going out there.

NAME: LEIA
Are you crazy?!

NAME: HAN
I just got this bucket back
together.  I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

NAME: LEIA
Then I'm going with you.

NAME: THREEPIO
I think it might be better if I
stay here and guard the ship.
(hears another
mysterious noise)
Oh, no.

NAME: LEIA
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock at all.

NAME: HAN
There's an awful lot of moisture
in here.

NAME: LEIA
I don't know.  I have a bad feeling
about this.

NAME: HAN
Yeah.

NAME: HAN
Watch out!

NAME: HAN
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest
of the ship, make sure there
aren't any more attached.  They're
chewing on the power cables.

NAME: LEIA
Mynocks?

NAME: HAN
Go on inside.  We'll clean them
off if there are any more.

NAME: THREEPIO
Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly
little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

NAME: HAN
Wait a minute...

NAME: HAN
All right, Chewie, let's get
out of here!

NAME: LEIA
The Empire is still out there.
I don't think it's wise to...

NAME: HAN
No time to discuss this in
committee.

NAME: LEIA
I am not a committee!

NAME: LEIA
You can't make the jump to light-
speed in this asteroid field...

NAME: HAN
Sit down, sweetheart.  We're
taking off!

NAME: THREEPIO
Look!

NAME: HAN
I see it, I see it.

NAME: THREEPIO
We're doomed!

NAME: LEIA
The cave is collapsing.

NAME: HAN
This is no cave.

NAME: LEIA
What?

NAME: YODA
Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.  But beware
of the dark side.  Anger... fear...
aggression.  The dark side of
the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join
you in a fight.  If once you
start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan's apprentice.

NAME: LUKE
Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

NAME: YODA
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

NAME: LUKE
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?

NAME: YODA
You will know.  When you are calm,
at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and
defense, never for attack.

NAME: LUKE
But tell me why I can't...

NAME: YODA
No, no, there is no why.  Nothing
more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

NAME: LUKE
There's something not right here.

NAME: LUKE
I feel cold, death.

NAME: YODA
That place... is strong with the
dark side of the Force.  A domain
of evil it is.  In you must go.

NAME: LUKE
What's in there?

NAME: YODA
Only what you take with you.

NAME: YODA
Your weapons... you will not
need them.

NAME: PIETT
Bounty hunters.  We don't need
that scum.

NAME: FIRST CONTROLLER
Yes, sir.

NAME: PIETT
Those Rebels won't escape us.

NAME: SECOND CONTROLLER
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

NAME: PIETT
Right.

NAME: VADER
... there will be a substantial
reward for the one who finds the
Millennium Falcon.  You are free
to use any methods necessary, but
I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

NAME: BOBA FETT
As you wish.

NAME: PIETT
Lord Vader!  My lord, we have
them.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, thank goodness we're coming
out of the asteroid field.

NAME: HAN
Let's get out of here.  Ready for
light-speed?  One... two... three!

NAME: HAN
It's not fair!

NAME: HAN
The transfer circuits are working.
It's not my fault!

NAME: LEIA
(almost expecting
it)
No light-speed?

NAME: HAN
It's not my fault.

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, we just lost the main rear
deflector shield.  One more direct
hit on the back quarter and we're
done for.

NAME: HAN
Turn her around.

NAME: HAN
I said turn her around!  I'm
going to put all power in the
front shield.

NAME: LEIA
You're going to attack them?!

NAME: THREEPIO
Sir, the odds of surviving a
direct assault on an Imperial
Star Destroyer...

NAME: LEIA
Shut up!

NAME: NEEDA
They're moving to attack
position!  Shields up!

NAME: NEEDA
Track them.  They may come
around for another pass.

NAME: TRACKING OFFICER
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

NAME: NEEDA
They can't have disappeared.  No
ship that small has a cloaking
device.

NAME: TRACKING OFFICER
Well, there's no trace of them,
sir.

NAME: COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
Captain, Lord Vader demands an
update on the pursuit.

NAME: NEEDA
Get a shuttle ready.  I shall
assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord
Vader. Meanwhile, continue to
scan the area.

NAME: COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER
Yes, Captain Needa.

NAME: YODA
Use the Force.  Yes...

NAME: YODA
Now... the stone.  Feel it.

NAME: YODA
Concentrate!

NAME: LUKE
Oh, no.  We'll never get it out
now.

NAME: YODA
So certain are you.  Always with
you it cannot be done.  Hear you
nothing that I say?

NAME: LUKE
Master, moving stones around is
one thing.  This is totally
different.

NAME: YODA
No!  No different!  Only different
in your mind.  You must unlearn
what you have learned.

NAME: LUKE
All right, I'll give it a try.

NAME: YODA
No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.
There is no try.

NAME: LUKE
I can't.  It's too big.

NAME: YODA
Size matters not.  Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?  Mmmm.

NAME: YODA
And well you should not.  For my
ally in the Force.  And a powerful
ally it is.  Life creates it, makes
it grow.  Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.  Luminous beings
are we...
(Yoda pinches
Luke's shoulder)
... not this crude matter.
You must feel the Force around you.
Here, between you... me... the
tree... the rock... everywhere!
Yes, even between this land and
that ship!

NAME: LUKE
You want the impossible.

NAME: LUKE
I don't... I don't believe it.

NAME: YODA
That is why you fail.

NAME: VADER
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

NAME: PIETT
Lord Vader, our ships have
completed their scan of the area
and found nothing.  If the
Millennium Falcon went into light-
speed, it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

NAME: VADER
Alert all commands.  Calculate
every possible destination along
their last know trajectory.

NAME: PIETT
Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

NAME: VADER
Don't fail me again, Admiral.

NAME: PIETT
Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

NAME: THREEPIO
Captain Solo, this time you have
gone too far.
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

NAME: HAN
The fleet is beginning to break
up.  Go back and stand by the
manual release for the landing claw.

NAME: THREEPIO
I really don't see how that is
going to help.  Surrender is a
perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances.  The
Empire may be gracious enough...

NAME: HAN
Thank you.

NAME: LEIA
What did you have in mind for
your next move?

NAME: HAN
Well, if they follow standard
Imperial procedure, they'll dump
their garbage before they go to
light-speed, then we just float
away.

NAME: LEIA
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

NAME: HAN
Then we've got to find a safe
port somewhere around here.  Got
any ideas?

NAME: LEIA
No.  Where are we?

NAME: HAN
The Anoat system.

NAME: LEIA
Anoat system.  There's not much
there.

NAME: HAN
No.  Well, wait.  This is
interesting.  Lando.

NAME: LEIA
Lando system?

NAME: HAN
Lando's not a system, he's a man.
Lando Calrissian.  He's a card
player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd
like him.

NAME: LEIA
Thanks.

NAME: HAN
Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I
think we can make it.

NAME: LEIA
(reading from the
computer)
A mining colony?

NAME: HAN
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando
conned somebody out of it.  We
go back a long way, Lando and me.

NAME: LEIA
Can you trust him?

NAME: HAN
No.  But he has no love for the
Empire, I can tell you that.

NAME: HAN
Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
Detach!

NAME: LEIA
You do have your moments.  Not
many, but you have them.

NAME: YODA
Concentrate... feel the Force
flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you
will see.  Other places.  The
future... the past.  Old friends
long gone.

NAME: LUKE
Han!  Leia!

NAME: YODA
Hmm.  Control, control.  You must
learn control.

NAME: LUKE
I saw... I saw a city in the
clouds.

NAME: YODA
Mmm.  Friends you have there.

NAME: LUKE
They were in pain.

NAME: YODA
It is the future you see.

NAME: LUKE
Future?  Will they die?

NAME: YODA
Difficult to see.  Always in
motion is the future.

NAME: LUKE
I've got to go to them.

NAME: YODA
Decide you must how to serve
them best.  If you leave now,
help them you could.  But you
would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered.

NAME: HAN
No, I don't have a landing
permit.  I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

NAME: HAN
Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me
explain.

NAME: INTERCOM VOICE
You will not deviate from your
present course.

NAME: THREEPIO
Rather touchy, aren't they?

NAME: LEIA
I thought you knew this person.

NAME: HAN
Well, that was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about
that.

NAME: INTERCOM VOICE
Permission granted to land on
Platform Three-two-seven.

NAME: HAN
Thank you.

NAME: HAN
There's nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

NAME: LEIA
Who's worried?

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh.  No one to meet us.

NAME: LEIA
I don't like this.

NAME: HAN
Well, what would you like?

NAME: THREEPIO
Well, they did let us land.

NAME: HAN
Look, don't worry.  Everything's
going to be fine.  Trust me.

NAME: HAN
See?  My friend.
Keep your eyes open, okay?

NAME: LANDO
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler!  You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after
what you pulled.

NAME: LANDO
How you doing, you old pirate?
So good to see you!  I never thought
I'd catch up with you again.  Where
you been?

NAME: THREEPIO
Well, he seems very friendly.

NAME: LEIA
Yes... very friendly.

NAME: LANDO
What are you doing here?

NAME: HAN
(gestures toward
the Falcon)
Ahh... repairs.  I thought you
could help me out.

NAME: LANDO
What have you done to my ship?

NAME: HAN
Your ship?  Hey, remember, you
lost her to me fair and square.

NAME: LANDO
Hello.  What have we here?
Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this
facility.  And who might you be?

NAME: LEIA
Leia.

NAME: LANDO
Welcome, Leia.

NAME: HAN
All right, all right, you old
smoothie.

NAME: THREEPIO
Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations.  My
facilities are at your...

NAME: THREEPIO
Well, really!

NAME: LANDO
What's wrong with the Falcon?

NAME: HAN
Hyperdrive.

NAME: LANDO
I'll get my people to work on it.

NAME: HAN
Good.

NAME: LANDO
You know, that ship saved my life
quite a few times.  She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

NAME: HAN
How's the gas mine?  Is it
paying off for you?

NAME: LANDO
Oh, not as well as I'd like.
We're a small outpost and not
very self-sufficient.  And I've
had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labor difficulties...
(catches Han
grinning at him)
What's so funny?

NAME: HAN
You.  Listen to you - you sound
like a businessman, a responsible
leader.  Who'd have thought that,
huh?

NAME: LANDO
You know, seeing you sure
brings back a few things.

NAME: HAN
Yeah.

NAME: LANDO
Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay for being
successful.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

NAME: SECOND THREEPIO
E chu ta!

NAME: THREEPIO
How rude!

NAME: THREEPIO
That sounds like an R2 unit in
there.  I wonder if...

NAME: THREEPIO
Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

NAME: MAN'S VOICE
Who are you?

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I
didn't mean to intrude.  No, no,
please don't get up.  No!

NAME: YODA
Luke!  You must complete the
training.

NAME: LUKE
I can't keep the vision out of my
head.  They're my friends.  I've
got to help them.

NAME: YODA
You must not go!

NAME: LUKE
But Han and Leia will die if I
don't.

NAME: BEN'S VOICE
You don't know that.

NAME: BEN
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

NAME: LUKE
But I can help them!  I feel
the Force!

NAME: BEN
But you cannot control it.  This
is a dangerous time for you,
when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force.

NAME: YODA
Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.  Remember your failure
at the cave!

NAME: LUKE
But I've learned so much since
then.  Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.

NAME: BEN
It is you and your abilities the
Emperor wants.  that is why your
friends are made to suffer.

NAME: LUKE
And that is why I have to go.

NAME: BEN
Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

NAME: LUKE
You won't.

NAME: YODA
Stopped they must be.  On this
all depends.  Only a fully trained
Jedi Knight with the Force as his
ally will conquer Vader and his
Emperor.  If you end your training
now, if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did, you will
become an agent of evil.

NAME: BEN
Patience.

NAME: LUKE
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

NAME: YODA
If you honor what they fight for
... yes!

NAME: BEN
If you choose to face Vader, you
will do it alone.  I cannot
interfere.

NAME: LUKE
I understand.
(he moves to his
X-wing)
Artoo, fire up the converters.

NAME: BEN
Luke, don't give in to hate -
that leads to the dark side.

NAME: YODA
Strong is Vader.  Mind what you
have learned.  Save you it can.

NAME: LUKE
I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

NAME: YODA
Told you, I did.  Reckless is
he.  Now matters are worse.

NAME: BEN
That boy is our last hope.

NAME: YODA
No.  There is another.

NAME: HAN
The ship is almost finished.
Two or Three more things and
we're in great shape.

NAME: LEIA
The sooner the better.  Something's
wrong here.  No one has seen or
knows anything about Threepio.
He's been gone too long to have
gotten lost.

NAME: HAN
Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and
see what I can find out.

NAME: LEIA
I don't trust Lando.

NAME: HAN
Well, I don't trust him, either.
But he is my friend.  Besides,
we'll soon be gone.

NAME: LEIA
And then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

NAME: LEIA
What happened?

NAME: HAN
Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

NAME: LEIA
Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you
think you can repair him?

NAME: HAN
Lando's got people who can fix
him.

NAME: LEIA
No, thanks.

NAME: LANDO
I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting
anything?

NAME: LEIA
Not really.

NAME: LANDO
You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

NAME: LEIA
Thank you.

NAME: LANDO
Will you join me for a little
refreshment?

NAME: LANDO
Everyone's invited, of course.

NAME: LANDO
Having trouble with you droid?

NAME: HAN
No.  No problem.  Why?

NAME: LANDO
So you see, since we're a small
operation, we don't fall into
the... uh... jurisdiction of the
Empire.

NAME: LEIA
So you're part of the mining
guild then?

NAME: LANDO
No, not actually.  Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed...
which is advantageous for everybody
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to
themselves.

NAME: HAN
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out about this
little operation and shut you down?

NAME: LANDO
That's always been a danger looming
like a shadow over everything we've
built here.  But things have
developed that will insure security.
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

NAME: VADER
We would be honored if you would
join us.

NAME: LANDO
I had no choice.  They arrived
right before you did.  I'm sorry.

NAME: HAN
I'm sorry, too.

NAME: LUKE
No, Threepio's with them.

NAME: LUKE
Just hang on.  We're almost there.

NAME: THREEPIO
Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take
this off!  I, uh, don't mean to
intrude here.  I, don't, no, no,
no... Please don't get up.  No!

NAME: THREEPIO
Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in
danger.  I must tell the others.
Oh, no!  I've been shot!

NAME: LANDO
Lord Vader.

NAME: VADER
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hut after I have
Skywalker.

NAME: BOBA FETT
He's no good to me dead.

NAME: VADER
He will not be permanently damaged.

NAME: LANDO
Lord Vader, what about Leia and
the Wookiee?

NAME: VADER
They must never again leave this
city.

NAME: LANDO
That was never a condition of our
agreement, nor was giving Han to
this bounty hunter!

NAME: VADER
Perhaps you think you're being
treated unfairly.

NAME: LANDO
No.

NAME: VADER
Good.  It would be unfortunate if
I had to leave a garrison here.

NAME: LANDO
This deal's getting worse all
the time.

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like
that.  Oh!  Something's not right
because now I can't see.  Wait.
Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?
I'm backwards, you stupid furball.
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

NAME: HAN
I feel terrible.

NAME: LEIA
Why are they doing this?

NAME: HAN
They never even asked me any
questions.

NAME: LEIA
Lando.

NAME: HAN
Get out of here, Lando!

NAME: LANDO
Shut up and listen!  Vader has
agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
over to me.

NAME: HAN
Over to you?

NAME: LANDO
They'll have to stay here, but at
least they'll be safe.

NAME: LEIA
What about Han?

NAME: LANDO
Vader's giving him to the bounty
hunter.

NAME: LEIA
Vader wants us all dead.

NAME: LANDO
He doesn't want you at all.  He's
after somebody called Skywalker.

NAME: HAN
Luke?

NAME: LANDO
Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

NAME: LEIA
And we're the bait.

NAME: LANDO
Well, he's on his way.

NAME: HAN
Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty
good, didn't you?
My friend!

NAME: LANDO
Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm
sorry I couldn't do better, but
I have my own problems.

NAME: HAN
Yeah, you're a real hero.

NAME: LEIA
You certainly have a way with
people.

NAME: VADER
This facility is crude, but it
should be adequate to freeze
Skywalker for his journey to the
Emperor.

NAME: IMPERIAL SOLDIER
Lord Vader, ship approaching.
X-wing class.

NAME: VADER
Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow
him to land.

NAME: LANDO
Lord Vader, we only use this
facility for carbon freezing.  If
you put him in there, it might
kill him.

NAME: VADER
I do not want the Emperor's prize
damaged.  We will test it... on
Captain Solo.

NAME: THREEPIO
If only you had attached my legs,
I wouldn't be in this ridiculous
position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility to me,
so don't do anything foolish.

NAME: HAN
What's going on... buddy?

NAME: LANDO
You're being put into carbon freeze.

NAME: BOBA FETT
What if he doesn't survive?  He's
worth a lot to me.

NAME: VADER
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies.  Put him in!

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,
Chewbacca, stop...!

NAME: HAN
Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear
me?  Stop!

NAME: THREEPIO
Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready
to die.

NAME: HAN
Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help
me.  Hey!

NAME: HAN
Save your strength.  There'll be
another time.  The princess - you
have to take care of her.  You
hear me?

NAME: LEIA
I love you!

NAME: HAN
I know.

NAME: THREEPIO
What... what's going on?  Turn
round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
Oh... they've encased him in
carbonite.  He should be quite
well-protected - if he survives
the freezing process, that is.

NAME: VADER
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

NAME: LANDO
Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect
hibernation.

NAME: VADER
He's all yours bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

NAME: IMPERIAL OFFICER
Skywalker has just landed, my
lord.

NAME: VADER
Good.  See to it that he finds
his way here.  Calrissian, take
the princess and the Wookiee to
my ship.

NAME: LANDO
You said they'd be left in the
city under my supervision.

NAME: VADER
I am altering the deal.  Pray I
don't alter it any further.

NAME: LEIA
Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a
trap!  It's a trap!

NAME: VADER
The Force is with you, young
Skywalker.  But you are not a
Jedi yet.

NAME: LANDO
Well done.  Hold them in the
security tower - and keep it
quiet.  Move.

NAME: LEIA
What do you think you're doing?

NAME: LANDO
We're getting out of here.

NAME: THREEPIO
I knew all along it had to be a
mistake.

NAME: LEIA
Do you think that after what you
did to Han we're going to trust
you?

NAME: LANDO
I had no choice...

NAME: THREEPIO
What are you doing?  Trust him,
trust him!

NAME: LEIA
Oh, so we understand, don't we,
Chewie?  He had no choice.

NAME: LANDO
I'm just trying to help...

NAME: LEIA
We don't need any of your help.

NAME: LANDO
H-a-a-a...

NAME: LEIA
What?

NAME: THREEPIO
It sounds like Han.

NAME: LANDO
There's still a chance to save
Han... I mean, at the East
Platform...

NAME: LEIA
Chewie.

NAME: THREEPIO
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

NAME: BOBA FETT
Put Captain Solo in the cargo
hold.

NAME: THREEPIO
Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you
been?

NAME: THREEPIO
Turn around, you wooly...!
Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to
save Han from the bounty hunter!

NAME: THREEPIO
Well, at least your still in
one piece!  Look what happened to
me!

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind
you!

NAME: VADER
You have learned much, young one.

NAME: LUKE
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

NAME: VADER
Your destiny lies with me,
Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to
be true.

NAME: LUKE
No!

NAME: VADER
All to easy.  Perhaps you are not
as strong as the Emperor thought.

NAME: VADER
Impressive... most impressive.

NAME: VADER
Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You
have controlled your fear... now
release your anger.

NAME: VADER
Only your hatred can destroy me.

NAME: LANDO
The security codes has been changed!

NAME: THREEPIO
Artoo, you can tell the computer
to override the security system.

NAME: LANDO
Attention!  This is Lando
Calrissian.  The Empire has takes
control of the city.  I advise
everyone to leave before more
Imperial troops arrive.

NAME: LANDO
This way.

NAME: THREEPIO
Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power
socket from a computer terminal.

NAME: THREEPIO
What are you talking about?  We're
not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon.  It's
fixed!  Just open the door, you
stupid lump.

NAME: THREEPIO
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

NAME: THREEPIO
Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend
down, you thoughtless... Ow!

NAME: LANDO
Leia!  Go!

NAME: THREEPIO
I thought that hairy beast would
be the end of me.  Of course, I've
looked better.

NAME: VADER
You are beaten.  It is useless
to resist.  Don't let yourself
be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

NAME: VADER
There is no escape.  Don't make
me destroy you.  You do not yet
realize your importance.  You
have only begun to discover your
power.  Join me and I will complete
your training.  With our combined
strength, we can end this destructive
conflict and bring order to the
galaxy.

NAME: LUKE
I'll never join you!

NAME: VADER
If you only knew the power of the
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father.

NAME: LUKE
He told me enough!  It was you
who killed him.

NAME: VADER
No.  I am your father.

NAME: LUKE
No.  No.  That's not true!
That's impossible!

NAME: VADER
Search your feelings.  You know
it to be true.

NAME: LUKE
No!  No!  No!

NAME: VADER
Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your
destiny.  Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy as father
and son.  Come with me.  It is the
only way.

NAME: LUKE
Ben... Ben, please!

NAME: LUKE
Ben.  Leia!

NAME: LUKE
Hear me!  Leia!

NAME: LEIA
Luke... We've got to go back.

NAME: LANDO
What?

NAME: LEIA
I know where Luke is.

NAME: LANDO
But what about those fighter?

NAME: LEIA
Chewie, just do it.

NAME: LANDO
But what about Vader?

NAME: LANDO
All right, all right, all right.

NAME: VADER
Bring my shuttle.

NAME: LANDO
(pointing out the
cockpit window)
Look, someone's up there.

NAME: LEIA
It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
Slow down and we'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

NAME: LEIA
Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

NAME: LEIA
Lando?

NAME: LANDO
Okay, let's go.

NAME: LUKE
Oh, Leia.

NAME: LANDO
All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

NAME: LEIA
I'll be back.

NAME: LEIA
Star Destroyer.

NAME: LANDO
All right, Chewie.  Ready for
light-speed.

NAME: LEIA
If your people fixed the
hyperdrive.

NAME: LEIA
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

NAME: LANDO
Punch it!

NAME: LANDO
They told me they fixed it.  I
trusted them to fix it.  It's not
my fault!

NAME: PIETT
They'll be in range of our
tractor beam in moments, my lord.

NAME: VADER
Did your men deactivate the
hyperdrive on the Millennium
Falcon?

NAME: PIETT
Yes, my lord.

NAME: VADER
Good.  Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

NAME: PIETT
Yes, my lord.

NAME: THREEPIO
Noisy brute.  Why don't we just
go into light-speed?

NAME: THREEPIO
We can't?  How would you know the
hyperdrive is deactivated?

NAME: THREEPIO
The city's central computer told
you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch!  Pay attention to what
you're doing!

NAME: VADER
Luke.

NAME: LUKE
Father.

NAME: VADER
Son, come with me.

NAME: LUKE
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

NAME: LANDO
Chewie!

NAME: LUKE
It's Vader.

NAME: VADER
Luke... it is your destiny.

NAME: LUKE
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

NAME: PIETT
Alert all commands.  Ready for
the tractor beam.

NAME: THREEPIO
Artoo, come back at once!  You
haven't finished with me yet!
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do
it.  I'm standing here in pieces,
and you're having delusions of
grandeur!

NAME: THREEPIO
Oh, you did it!

NAME: LANDO
Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

NAME: LUKE
Good luck, Lando

NAME: LANDO
When we find Jabba the Hut and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact
you.

NAME: LUKE
I'll meet you at the rendezvous
point on Tatooine.

NAME: LANDO
Princess, we'll find Han.  I
promise.

NAME: LUKE
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your
signal.

NAME: LUKE
Take care, you two.  May the
Force be with you.

NAME: LUKE
Ow!

NAME: FINAL DRAFT
June 3, 2008

NAME: GANG BOSS
I see you like to CHEW!
Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!

NAME: WARRIOR
Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!

NAME: SMITTEN BUNNY
And ATTRACTIVE!

NAME: GRATEFUL BUNNY
How can we repay you??

NAME: WARRIOR
There is no charge for awesomeness,
or attractiveness.

NAME: MONKEY
We should hang out.

NAME: WARRIOR
Agreed.

NAME: MONKEY
Po! Get up!

NAME: TIGRESS
You'll be late for work!

NAME: PO
Whu?

NAME: PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Po! What are you doing up there?

NAME: PO
Uh, nothing!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
Tigress! Rowrrrr...

NAME: PO
Coming!

NAME: PO
Sorry, Dad.

NAME: PO'S DAD
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
What were you doing up there? All
that noise.

NAME: PO
Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
dream.

NAME: PO'S DAD
About what?

NAME: PO
Huh?

NAME: PO'S DAD
The dream. What were you dreaming
about?

NAME: PO
What was I... eh, I was dreaming
about uh... heh...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Noodles.

NAME: PO'S DAD
Noodles. You were really dreaming
about noodles?

NAME: PO
Uh, yeah. What else would I be
dreaming about?

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Careful, that soup is... sharp!

NAME: PO'S DAD
Oh, happy day! My son, finally
having the noodle dream!

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
You don't know how long I have been
waiting for this moment.

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
This is a sign, Po!

NAME: PO
Uh...a sign of what?

NAME: PO'S DAD
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret
ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
Soup." And then you will fulfill
your destiny and take over the
restaurant, just as I took it over
from my father, who took it over
from his father, who won it from a
friend in a game of mahjong.

NAME: PO
Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.

NAME: PO'S DAD
No, it was the dream. We are noodle
folk. Broth runs through our veins.

NAME: PO
But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
want to do something else?
Something besides noodles?

NAME: PO'S DAD
Actually...

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
When I was young and crazy...

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
I thought about running away and
learning how to make tofu.

NAME: PO
So why didn't you?!

NAME: PO'S DAD
Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
Can you imagine, me making tofu?
No. We all have our place in this
world. Mine is here. And yours is--

NAME: PO
I know. Is here.

NAME: PO'S DAD
No, it's at tables two, five,
seven, and twelve.

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Service with a smile!

NAME: SHIFU
Well done, students... if you were
trying to disappoint me.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey, greater speed.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
Mantis--

NAME: ZENG
Master Shifu!

NAME: SHIFU
What?!

NAME: ZENG
Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
to see you.

NAME: SHIFU
Master Oogway? You summoned me.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Is something wrong?

NAME: OOGWAY
Why must something be wrong for me
to want to see my old friend?

NAME: SHIFU
So... nothing's wrong?

NAME: OOGWAY
Well, I didn't say that.

NAME: SHIFU
You were saying?

NAME: OOGWAY
I have had a vision... Tai Lung
will return.

NAME: SHIFU
That is impossible. He is in
prison.

NAME: OOGWAY
Nothing is impossible.

NAME: SHIFU
Zeng!

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
to double the guards, double their
weapons. Double everything! Tai
Lung does not leave that prison!

NAME: ZENG
Yes, Master Shifu.

NAME: OOGWAY
One often meets his destiny on the
road he takes to avoid it.

NAME: SHIFU
We have to do something. We can't
just let him march on the valley,
and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--

NAME: OOGWAY
Your mind is like this water, my
friend. When it is agitated, it
becomes difficult to see. But if
you allow it to settle, the answer
becomes clear.

NAME: SHIFU
The Dragon Scroll...

NAME: OOGWAY
It is time.

NAME: SHIFU
But who? Who is worthy to be
trusted with the secret to
limitless power? To become...the
Dragon Warrior?!

NAME: OOGWAY
I don't know.

NAME: PO
Oop...sorry.

NAME: ANGRY PATRON
Hey! Watch it, Po!

NAME: PO
Sorry. Suck it up.

NAME: DISGUSTED PATRON
Ugh!

NAME: PO
Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
What?! Master Oogway's choosing the
Dragon Warrior! Today!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the
Jade Palace!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
One of the Five is gonna get the
Dragon Scroll!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this! Just take the bowl!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it, just
go!

NAME: PO'S DAD
Po! Where are you going?

NAME: PO
To the...Jade Palace?

NAME: PO'S DAD
But you're forgetting your noodle
cart! The whole valley will be
there, and you'll sell noodles to
all of them.

NAME: PO
Selling noodles? But Dad, you know,
I was kinda thinking maybe I...

NAME: PO'S DAD
Yeah?

NAME: PO
I was kinda thinking maybe I...

NAME: PO'S DAD
Uh huh?

NAME: PO
...Could also sell the bean buns.
They are about to go bad.

NAME: PO'S DAD
That's my boy! I told you that
dream was a sign!

NAME: PO
Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.

NAME: PO
Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost
there...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
What? No! Oh No!

NAME: KG SHAW
Sorry, Po.

NAME: JR SHAW
We'll bring you back a souvenir.

NAME: PO
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

NAME: SHIFU
It is an historic day, isn't it,
Master Oogway?

NAME: OOGWAY
Yes, and one I feared I would not
live to see. Are your students
ready?

NAME: SHIFU
Yes, Master Oogway.

NAME: OOGWAY
Now know this, old friend. Whomever
I choose will not only bring peace
to the Valley, but also to you.

NAME: ANNOUNCER
Let the tournament begin!

NAME: PO
Yeah!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Hey! Open the door!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Let me in!

NAME: SHIFU
Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It
is my great honor to present to
you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!

NAME: PO
The Furious Five!

NAME: SHIFU
Warriors prepare!

NAME: PO
Peeky-hole!

NAME: SHIFU
Ready for battle!

NAME: PO
Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of
Fire!

NAME: PIG FAN
Whoa! Look at that.

NAME: PO
Hey, get out of the way!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ow...

NAME: SHIFU
And finally...Master Tigress!

NAME: SHIFU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
And believe me citizens, you have
not seen anything yet!

NAME: OOGWAY
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among
us.

NAME: SHIFU
Citizens of the Valley of Peace!
Master Oogway will now choose...
the Dragon Warrior!

NAME: PO
Huh? Oh no! Wait!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Yeah!

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

NAME: PO
What does it look like I'm doing?
Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the
Dragon Warrior!

NAME: PO'S DAD
But I don't understand. You finally
had the noodle dream.

NAME: PO
I lied. I don't dream about
noodles, Dad!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-

NAME: PO'S DAD
Come on, son. Let's get back to
work.

NAME: PO
Okay.

NAME: PO'S DAD
Oh! Come back!

NAME: CROWD
Oooh! Aaahh!

NAME: PO
Uh oh...

NAME: PO
What's going on? Where...uh? What
are you pointing--?

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to
see who the Dragon Warrior was.

NAME: OOGWAY
How interesting.

NAME: TIGRESS
Master, are you pointing at...me?

NAME: OOGWAY
Him.

NAME: PO
Who--?

NAME: OOGWAY
You.

NAME: PO
Me?

NAME: OOGWAY
The universe has brought us the
Dragon Warrior!

NAME: PO
What?

NAME: FURIOUS FIVE
What??

NAME: SHIFU
What???

NAME: SHIFU
Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
panda can't possibly be the answer
to... our problem. You were about
to point at Tigress. That thing
fell in front of her. That was just
an accident!

NAME: OOGWAY
There are no accidents.

NAME: TIGRESS
Forgive us, Master. We have failed
you.

NAME: SHIFU
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I will have failed
you.

NAME: ZENG
Wait wait wait! I bring a message
from Master Shifu.

NAME: COMMANDER
What?!?!
"Double the guard?! Extra
precautions?! Your prison may not
be adequate!"

NAME: COMMANDER (CONT'D)
You doubt my prison's security?

NAME: ZENG
Absolutely not.
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

NAME: COMMANDER
I'll give you a message for your
Master Shifu.

NAME: COMMANDER
Escape from Chogun Prison is
impossible!

NAME: ZENG
Whoa.

NAME: COMMANDER
Impressive, isn't it?

NAME: ZENG
Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
impressive.

NAME: COMMANDER
One way in, one way out, one
thousand guards, and one prisoner.

NAME: ZENG
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
Lung...

NAME: COMMANDER
Take us down.

NAME: ZENG
What are you doing?!

NAME: ZENG (CONT'D)
Oh my...

NAME: COMMANDER
Behold, Tai Lung.

NAME: ZENG
I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
here.

NAME: COMMANDER
It's nothing to worry about. It's
perfectly safe.

NAME: ZENG
Oof!

NAME: COMMANDER
Crossbows! At the ready!

NAME: ZENG
Crossbows?!

NAME: COMMANDER
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's finally gonna give someone
the Dragon Scroll and it's not
gonna be you!

NAME: ZENG
What are you doing?! Don't get him
mad.

NAME: COMMANDER
What's he gonna do about it? I've
got him completely immobilized.

NAME: COMMANDER (CONT'D)
Awww. Did I step on the witty
kitty's tail? Awww.

NAME: ZENG
I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
to worry about.

NAME: COMMANDER
No, he doesn't.

NAME: ZENG
Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
please go now?

NAME: CROWD
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

NAME: PO
Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think
there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm,
uh...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors.
No way! Would you look at this
place!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Nooo! Ohhhh!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
The legendary Urn of Whispering
Warriors! Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu army.
Hellooo?

NAME: SHIFU
Have you finished sight-seeing?

NAME: PO
Sorry. I should've come to see you
first.

NAME: SHIFU
My patience is wearing thin.

NAME: PO
Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

NAME: SHIFU
Would you turn around?

NAME: PO
Sure.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Hey, how's it going?

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Now how do you get five thousand--
Master Shifu!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna
fix it. Do you have some glue?

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ow! Ooh. Splinter.

NAME: SHIFU
So you're the legendary Dragon
Warrior. Hmmm?

NAME: PO
Uh...I guess so?

NAME: SHIFU
Wrong! You are not the Dragon
Warrior. You will never be the
Dragon Warrior until you have
learned the secret of the Dragon
Scroll.

NAME: PO
Whoa.
So how does this work? You have a
ladder or trampoline or...?

NAME: SHIFU
You think it's that easy? That I am
just going to hand you the secret
to limitless power?

NAME: PO
No, I...

NAME: SHIFU
One must first master the highest
level of kung fu. And that is
clearly impossible if that one is
someone like you.

NAME: PO
Someone like me?

NAME: SHIFU
Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Flabby arms...

NAME: PO
Those are sensitive in the flabby
parts.

NAME: SHIFU
And this ridiculous belly.

NAME: PO
Hey...

NAME: SHIFU
--and utter disregard for personal
hygiene.

NAME: PO
Now wait a minute. That's a little
uncalled-for.

NAME: SHIFU
Don't stand that close...I can
smell your breath.

NAME: PO
Listen...Oogway said that I was the-

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi
Finger Hold!

NAME: SHIFU
Oh, you know this hold?

NAME: PO
DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna
sty-- YES.

NAME: SHIFU
Oh, then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

NAME: PO
No no no!

NAME: SHIFU
You know the hardest part of this?
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards...

NAME: PO
Okay! Okay! Take it easy...

NAME: SHIFU
Now listen closely, panda. Oogway
may have picked you, but when I'm
through with you, I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't. Are
we clear?

NAME: PO
Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We
are so clear.

NAME: SHIFU
Good. I can't wait to get started.

NAME: SHIFU
Let's begin.

NAME: PO
Wait wait wait...What? Now?

NAME: SHIFU
Yes...now. Unless you think the
great Oogway was wrong, and you are
not the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: PO
Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I
can do all of those moves.

NAME: SHIFU
Well, if we don't try, we'll never
know will we?

NAME: PO
Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can
find something more suited to my
level.

NAME: SHIFU
And what level is that?

NAME: PO
Well, ya know...I'm not a master,
but uh, let's just start at zero,
level zero.

NAME: SHIFU
There is no such thing as level
zero.

NAME: PO
Hey! Maybe I can start with that.

NAME: SHIFU
That? We use that for training
children. And for propping the door
open when it's hot. But if you
insist...

NAME: PO
Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so
much bigger than your action
figures -- except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

NAME: SHIFU
Go ahead, panda. Show us what you
can do.

NAME: PO
Um, are they gonna watch? Or should
I just wait until they get back to
work or something...

NAME: SHIFU
Hit it.

NAME: PO
Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm
still digesting... So my kung fu
might not be as good as later on.

NAME: SHIFU
Just hit it.

NAME: PO
Alright. Whatcha got? You got
nothing cause I got it right here.
You picking on my friends? Get
ready to feel the thunder. I'm
comin' at him with the crazy feet.
Whatcha gonna do about my crazy
feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You
never seen bear style, you only
seen praying Mantis! OR... I could
come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm
comin' at ya snikity-snake.

NAME: SHIFU
Would you hit it!

NAME: PO
Alright...alright.

NAME: SHIFU
Why don't you try again?   A little
harder...

NAME: PO
How's tha--

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ow, that hurts.

NAME: SHIFU
This'll be easier than I thought.

NAME: PO
Feeling a little nauseous.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Oooohoohoo...my tenders.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
How did I do?

NAME: SHIFU
There is now a level zero.

NAME: MANTIS
There's no words.

NAME: CRANE
No denying that.

NAME: VIPER
I don't understand what Master
Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
just gonna get himself killed.

NAME: CRANE
He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
fell out of the sky on a ball of
fire.

NAME: MANTIS
When he walks, the very ground
shakes!

NAME: TIGRESS
One would think that Master Oogway
would choose someone who actually
knew Kung Fu.

NAME: CRANE
Yeah, or could at least touch his
toes.

NAME: MONKEY
Or even see his toes.

NAME: PO
Okay.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Great.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Oh hey...hi. You're up.

NAME: CRANE
Am now.

NAME: PO
I was just uh... Some day huh?
That kung fu stuff is hard work,
right? Your biceps sore?

NAME: CRANE
Um...I've had a long and rather
disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I
should probably get to sleep now.

NAME: PO
Yeah yeah yeah, of course.

NAME: CRANE
Okay, thanks.

NAME: PO
It's just...I'm such a big fan.

NAME: CRANE
Oop.

NAME: PO
You guys were totally amazing at
the Battle of Weeping River.
Outnumbered a thousand to one, but
you didn't stop, and then you
just... HI-YAH!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ooo, sorry about that.

NAME: CRANE
Look, you don't belong here.

NAME: PO
I know. I know. You're right. I
just - my whole life I've dreamed
of-

NAME: CRANE
No no no... I meant you don't
belong here. I mean, in this room.
This is my room. Property of Crane.

NAME: PO
Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you
want to get to sleep.

NAME: CRANE
Yeah.

NAME: PO
I'm keepin' you up. We got big
things tomorrow. Alright. You're
awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say.
Okay. Bye bye.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
What was that?

NAME: CRANE
I didn't say anything.

NAME: PO
Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep
well.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Seemed a little bit awkward.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake
you. Just uh...

NAME: TIGRESS
You don't belong here.

NAME: PO
Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is
your room.

NAME: TIGRESS
I mean...you don't belong in the
Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to
Kung Fu, and if you have any
respect for who we are and what we
do, you will be gone by morning.

NAME: PO
Big fan...

NAME: OOGWAY
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

NAME: PO
Is that what this is? I am so
sorry. I thought it was just a
regular peach tree.

NAME: OOGWAY
I understand. You eat when you are
upset.

NAME: PO
Upset? I'm not upset. What makes
you think I'm upset?

NAME: OOGWAY
So why are you upset?

NAME: PO
I probably sucked more today than
anyone in the history of kung fu,
in the history of China, in the
history of sucking.

NAME: OOGWAY
Probably.

NAME: PO
And the Five... man, you should
have seen them, they totally hate
me.

NAME: OOGWAY
Totally.

NAME: PO
How's Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior? I mean,
I'm not like The Five. I've got no
claws, no wings, no venom. Even
Mantis has those...
(he imitates a mantis'
front legs)
...thingies. Maybe I should just
quit and go back to making noodles.

NAME: OOGWAY
Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't
noodles.

NAME: OOGWAY (CONT'D)
You are too concerned with what was
and what will be. There is a
saying: Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
a gift. That is why it is called
the present.

NAME: ZENG
What's happening?!

NAME: COMMANDER
Fire Crossbows!

NAME: ZENG
Tai Lung is free! I must warn
Shifu!

NAME: COMMANDER
You're not going anywhere. And
neither is he.

NAME: ZENG
Let go of me!

NAME: COMMANDER
Bring it up!

NAME: ZENG
He's coming this way!

NAME: COMMANDER
He won't get far.
Archers!

NAME: ZENG
We're dead. So very, very dead.

NAME: COMMANDER
Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!

NAME: ZENG
Can we run now?

NAME: COMMANDER
Yes.

NAME: ZENG
Nuuu... Urggg...

NAME: TAI LUNG
I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
beginning to think I had been
forgotten.

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
Fly back there and tell them...the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

NAME: FURIOUS FIVE
Good morning master!

NAME: SHIFU
Panda! Panda, wake up!

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Hmm. He's quit.

NAME: VIPER
What do we do now, Master? With the
panda gone, who will be the Dragon
Warrior?

NAME: SHIFU
All we can do is resume our
training and trust that in time,
the true Dragon Warrior will be
revealed.

NAME: SHIFU
What are you doing here?!

NAME: PO
Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I
thought I'd warm up a little.

NAME: SHIFU
You're stuck.

NAME: PO
Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

NAME: SHIFU
Help him.

NAME: CRANE
Oh dear.

NAME: PO
Maybe on three. One. Two-

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Threeeee. Thank you.

NAME: CRANE
Don't mention it.

NAME: PO
No really, I appreci--

NAME: SHIFU
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one
night? It takes years to develop
one's flexibility and years longer
to apply it in combat.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Put that down! The only souvenirs
we collect here are bloody knuckles
and broken bones.

NAME: PO
Yeah, excellent!

NAME: SHIFU
Let's get started.

NAME: VIPER
Are you ready?

NAME: PO
I was born ready--

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Eaghhh...

NAME: VIPER
I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
said you were ready!

NAME: PO
That was awesome! Let's go again.

NAME: SHIFU
I've been taking it easy on you,
panda, but no more! Your next
opponent... will be me.

NAME: PO
Alright! Let's go!

NAME: SHIFU
Step forth.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness and make
him suffer for it.

NAME: PO
Oh, yeah!

NAME: SHIFU
To take his strength and use it
against him.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
--until he finally falls, or quits.

NAME: PO
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry, Master, I will never
quit!

NAME: TIGRESS
If he's smart, he won't come back
up those steps.

NAME: MONKEY
But he will.

NAME: VIPER
He's not gonna quit, is he?

NAME: MANTIS
He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll
tell ya that.

NAME: MANTIS
Trust me, it will. It's just not
easy finding the right nerve points
under all this--

NAME: PO
Fat?

NAME: MANTIS
Fur, I was gonna say fur.

NAME: PO
Sure you were.

NAME: MANTIS
Who am I to judge a warrior based
on his size? I mean -- look at me.

NAME: MANTIS (O.C.) (CONT'D)
I'm over here.

NAME: PO
Ow!

NAME: VIPER
Maybe you should take a look at
this again.

NAME: MANTIS
Oh! Okay.

NAME: PO
Ow! Don't...
Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master
Shifu's trying to inspire me and
all, but if I didn't know any
better, I'd say he was trying to
get rid of me.

NAME: MANTIS
I know he can seem kind of
heartless--

NAME: MANTIS (CONT'D)
But, ya know, he wasn't always like
that.

NAME: VIPER
According to legend, there was once
a time when Master Shifu actually
used to smile.

NAME: PO
No.

NAME: MANTIS
Yes.

NAME: VIPER
But that was before...

NAME: PO
Before what?

NAME: TIGRESS
Before Tai Lung.

NAME: CRANE
Uh yeah, we're not really supposed
to talk about him.

NAME: TIGRESS
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

NAME: PO
(trying to ease the
tension)
Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
He was a student, the first ever to
master the thousand...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
...scrolls of... kung fu... and...
then he turned bad... and now he's
in jail.

NAME: TIGRESS
He wasn't just a student.

NAME: TIGRESS
And now he has a chance to make
things right, to train the true
Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
you: a big, fat panda who treats it
like a joke.

NAME: PO
Doieeeee...

NAME: TIGRESS
Oh! That is it!

NAME: MANTIS
Wait! My fault! I accidentally
tweaked his facial nerve.

NAME: MANTIS (CONT'D)
And may have also stopped his
heart.

NAME: SHIFU
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
peace.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Would whoever is making that
flapping sound, quiet down!

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Inner...

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
some good news right now.

NAME: ZENG
Uh...

NAME: SHIFU
Master! Master!

NAME: OOGWAY
Hmmm?

NAME: SHIFU
I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.

NAME: OOGWAY
Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

NAME: SHIFU
Master, your vision...your vision
was right. Tai Lung has broken out
of prison. He's on his way!

NAME: OOGWAY
That is bad news...

NAME: OOGWAY (CONT'D)
...If you do not believe that the
Dragon Warrior can stop him.

NAME: SHIFU
The panda? Master, that panda is
not the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
He wasn't even meant to be here --
it was an accident!

NAME: OOGWAY
There are no accidents.

NAME: SHIFU
Yes, I know. You've said that
already. Twice.

NAME: OOGWAY
Well, that was no accident either.

NAME: SHIFU
Thrice.

NAME: OOGWAY
My old friend, the panda will never
fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
until you let go of the illusion of
control.

NAME: SHIFU
Illusion?

NAME: OOGWAY
Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
cannot make it blossom when it
suits me, nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

NAME: SHIFU
But there are things we can
control.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
I can control when the fruit will
fall.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
And I can control--

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
--where to plant the seed. That is
no illusion, Master.

NAME: OOGWAY
Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
that seed will grow to be a peach
tree. You may wish for an apple, or
an orange... but you will get a
peach.

NAME: SHIFU
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

NAME: OOGWAY
Maybe it can. If you are willing to
guide it, to nurture it. To believe
in it.

NAME: SHIFU
But how? How? I need your help,
Master.

NAME: OOGWAY
No, you just need to believe.
Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
will believe.

NAME: SHIFU
I... I will try.

NAME: OOGWAY
Good. My time has come. You must
continue your journey without me.

NAME: SHIFU
What... what are you..?

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Master, you can't leave me!

NAME: OOGWAY
You must believe.

NAME: SHIFU
Master!

NAME: PO
...but you're a lousy tipper.

NAME: CRANE
Really? So... how'd you get out of
there alive?

NAME: PO
I mean, I didn't actually say that,
but I thought it... in my mind.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
If he... could read my mind, he'd
have been like, "What?"
Order up!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Hope you like it.

NAME: MANTIS
This is really good.

NAME: PO
No, c'mon.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
You should try my dad's secret
ingredient soup. He actually knows
the secret ingredient.

NAME: VIPER
What are you talking about? This is
amazing.

NAME: CRANE
Wow, you're a really good cook.

NAME: MANTIS
I wish my mouth was bigger.

NAME: MONKEY
Tigress, you gotta try this.

NAME: TIGRESS
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time on
nothing but the dew of a single
gingko leaf and the energy of the
universe.

NAME: PO
I guess my body doesn't know it's
the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna
need a lot more than dew. And, uh,
universe juice.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
What?

NAME: MANTIS
Oh, nothing... Master Shifu!

NAME: PO
You will never be the Dragon
Warrior, unless you lose five
hundred pounds and brush your
teeth!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Work hard, Panda. And maybe,
someday... you will have ears like
mine.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ears. It's not working for you? I
thought they were pretty good.

NAME: MONKEY
It's Shifu.

NAME: PO
Of course it's Shifu. What do you
think I'm doing?

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Ooh! Master Shifu!

NAME: SHIFU
You think this is funny? Tai Lung
has escaped from prison and you're
acting like children!

NAME: PO
What?

NAME: SHIFU
He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,
and you are the only one who can
stop him.

NAME: PO
And here I am saying you got no
sense of humor. I'm gonna stop
Tai...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
What? You're serious? And I have to--
uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He
did it before, he'll do it again.

NAME: SHIFU
Oogway cannot, not anymore.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Our only hope is the Dragon
Warrior.

NAME: TIGRESS
The panda?

NAME: SHIFU
Yes, the panda!

NAME: TIGRESS
Master, please. Let us stop Tai
Lung. This is what you've trained
us for.

NAME: SHIFU
No! It is not your destiny to
defeat Tai Lung. It is his.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Where'd he go?

NAME: SHIFU
You cannot leave! A real warrior
never quits!

NAME: PO
Watch me!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Come on! How am I supposed to beat
Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to
the stairs.

NAME: SHIFU
You will beat him because you are
the Dragon Warrior!

NAME: PO
Ow! You don't believe that! You
never believed that! From the first
moment I got here, you've been
trying to get rid of me.

NAME: SHIFU
Yes. I was. But now I ask you to
trust in your master as I have come
to trust in mine.

NAME: PO
You're not my master. And I'm not
the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: SHIFU
Then why didn't you quit? You knew
I was trying to get rid of you, and
yet you stayed.

NAME: PO
Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because
every time you threw a brick at my
head or said I smelled, it hurt.
But it could never hurt more than
it did every day of my life just
being me.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
I stayed because I thought if
anyone could change me, could make
me... not me, it was you. The
greatest kung fu teacher in all of
China.

NAME: SHIFU
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior! And I
will!

NAME: PO
C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here
right now. And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here, how
are you gonna change this...
...into the Dragon Warrior? How?
How? How?!

NAME: SHIFU
I don't know!!!
I don't know.

NAME: PO
That's what I thought.

NAME: TIGRESS
This is what you trained me for.

NAME: VIPER
Tigress!

NAME: TIGRESS
Don't try and stop me!

NAME: VIPER
We're not trying to stop you!

NAME: TIGRESS
What?

NAME: VIPER
We're coming with you!

NAME: PO
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?

NAME: SHIFU
Oh, no need to explain. I just
thought you might be Monkey -- he
hides his almond cookies on the top
shelf.

NAME: PO
Don't tell Monkey.

NAME: SHIFU
Look at you.

NAME: PO
Yeah, I know. I disgust you.

NAME: SHIFU
No no, I mean... how did you get up
there?

NAME: PO
I don't know. I guess I-- I don't
know. I was getting a cookie...

NAME: SHIFU
And yet you are ten feet off the
ground and have done a perfect
split.

NAME: PO
No, this... this is just an
accident.

NAME: SHIFU
There are no accidents. Come with
me.

NAME: PO
I know you're trying to be all
mystical and kung fu-y, but could
you at least tell me where we're
going?

NAME: PO
You dragged me all the way out here
for a bath?!

NAME: SHIFU
Panda, we do not wash our pits in
The Pool of Sacred Tears.

NAME: PO
The pool of...

NAME: SHIFU
This is where Oogway unravelled the
mysteries of harmony and focus.
This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

NAME: PO
Yeah...

NAME: SHIFU
Then I am your master!

NAME: PO
Okay!

NAME: SHIFU
Don't cry.

NAME: PO
Okay.

NAME: SHIFU
When you focus on Kung Fu, when you
concentrate...you stink.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
But perhaps that is my fault. I
cannot train you the way I have
trained the Five. I now see that
the way to get through to you is
with this!

NAME: PO
Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.

NAME: SHIFU
Good. When you have been trained,
you may eat. Let us begin.

NAME: SHIFU
After you, panda.

NAME: PO
Just like that? No situps? No ten
mile hike?

NAME: SHIFU
I vowed to train you... and you
have been trained. You are free to
eat.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Enjoy.

NAME: PO
Hey!

NAME: SHIFU
I said you are free to eat. Have a
dumpling.

NAME: PO
Hey!

NAME: SHIFU
You are free to eat!

NAME: PO
Am I?

NAME: SHIFU
Are you?!

NAME: PO
I'm not hungry... master.

NAME: TIGRESS
Cut it!

NAME: TAI LUNG
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

NAME: TIGRESS
How do you know you're not looking
at her?

NAME: TAI LUNG
You think I'm a fool? I know you're
not the Dragon Warrior. None of
you!

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire, that he's a
warrior unlike anything the world
has ever seen.

NAME: MONKEY
Po?

NAME: TAI LUNG
So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
a worthy opponent. Our battle will
be legendary!

NAME: MONKEY
We've got this. Help her!

NAME: VIPER
Monkey!

NAME: MANTIS
Go!
Ack! What was I thinking?!

NAME: TIGRESS
Mantis!

NAME: TIGRESS (CONT'D)
Now!

NAME: TAI LUNG
Shifu taught you well...

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
But he didn't teach you everything.

NAME: SHIFU
You have done well, Panda.

NAME: PO
Done well? Done well?! I've done
awesome!

NAME: SHIFU
The mark of a true hero is
humility!

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
But yes...you have done awesome.

NAME: PO
Huh? Guys? Guys!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
They're dead? No, they're
breathing! They're asleep?! No,
their eyes are open.

NAME: CRANE
We were no match for his nerve
attack.

NAME: SHIFU
He has gotten stronger.

NAME: PO
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

NAME: MONKEY
He's too fast!

NAME: MONKEY (CONT'D)
Sorry, Po.

NAME: TIGRESS
I thought we could stop him.

NAME: SHIFU
He could have killed you.

NAME: MANTIS
Why didn't he?

NAME: SHIFU
So you could come back here and
strike fear into our hearts. But it
won't work!

NAME: PO
Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
pretty scared.

NAME: SHIFU
You can defeat him, panda.

NAME: PO
Are you kidding? If they can't--
They're five masters. I'm just one
me.

NAME: SHIFU
But you will have the one thing
that no one else does.

NAME: PO
You really believe I'm ready?

NAME: SHIFU
You are, Po.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
yours.

NAME: PO
Wait, what happens when I read it?

NAME: SHIFU
No one knows, but legend says you
will be able to hear a butterfly's
wing-beat.

NAME: PO
Whoa! Really? That's cool.

NAME: SHIFU
Yes. And see light in the deepest
cave. You will feel the universe in
motion around you.

NAME: PO
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?
Will I have invisibility--

NAME: SHIFU
Focus. Focus.

NAME: PO
Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.

NAME: SHIFU
Read it, Po, and fulfill your
destiny. Read it and become... the
Dragon Warrior!

NAME: PO
Whooaa!!!

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
It's impossible to open.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Come on baby. Come on now...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Thank you. I probably loosened it
up for you though... Okay, here
goes.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
It's blank!

NAME: SHIFU
What?

NAME: PO
Here! Look!

NAME: SHIFU
No! I am forbidden to look upon--

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Blank? I don't...I don't
understand.

NAME: PO
Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
crazy old turtle after all?

NAME: SHIFU
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

NAME: PO
Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
by accident. Of course I'm not the
Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?

NAME: TIGRESS
But who will stop Tai Lung?

NAME: CRANE
He'll destroy everything...and
everyone.

NAME: SHIFU
No, evacuate the Valley. You must
protect the villagers from Tai
Lung's rage.

NAME: TIGRESS
What about you master?

NAME: SHIFU
I will fight him.

NAME: PO
What?

NAME: SHIFU
I can hold him off long enough for
everyone to escape.

NAME: PO
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

NAME: SHIFU
Then I will finally have paid for
my mistake.

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Listen to me, all of you. It is
time for you to continue your
journey without me. I am very proud
to have been your master.

NAME: TIGRESS
We've got to get them out safely.

NAME: MONKEY
Come, little one. Let's find your
mama.

NAME: TIGRESS
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
way.

NAME: JR SHAW
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: PO
Hey, Dad.

NAME: PO'S DAD
Po!

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Good to have you back, son!

NAME: PO
Good to be back.

NAME: PO'S DAD
Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
it's time to face it -- the future
of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
no longer slices.

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Also, I was thinking, maybe this
time we'll have a kitchen you can
actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
that?

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
out. It just... wasn't meant to be.

NAME: PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
Po, forget everything else. Your
destiny still awaits. We are noodle
folk -- broth runs deep through our
veins.

NAME: PO
I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm
actually your son.

NAME: PO'S DAD
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you a
long time ago...

NAME: PO
Okay.

NAME: PO'S DAD
The secret ingredient of my secret
ingredient soup!

NAME: PO
Oh.

NAME: PO'S DAD
C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
nothing!

NAME: PO
Huh?

NAME: PO'S DAD
You heard me. Nothing. There is no
secret ingredient!

NAME: PO
Wait wait...it's just plain old
noodle soup? You don't add some
kind of special sauce or something?

NAME: PO'S DAD
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just have to believe
it's special.

NAME: PO
There is no secret ingredient...

NAME: TAI LUNG
I have come home, Master.

NAME: SHIFU
This is no longer your home. And I
am no longer your master.

NAME: TAI LUNG
Yes. You have a new favorite. So
where is this...Po? Did I scare him
off?

NAME: SHIFU
This battle is between you and me.

NAME: TAI LUNG
So. That is how it's going to be?

NAME: SHIFU
That is how it must be.

NAME: TAI LUNG
I rotted in jail for twenty years
because of your weakness!

NAME: SHIFU
Obeying your master is not
weakness!

NAME: TAI LUNG
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
You always knew...

NAME: SHIFU
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

NAME: SHIFU
It was never my decision to make!

NAME: TAI LUNG
It is now.

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
Give me the scroll!

NAME: SHIFU
I would rather die.

NAME: TAI LUNG
All I ever did, I did to make you
proud! Tell me how proud you are,
Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!

NAME: SHIFU
I have always been proud of you.
From the first moment, I've been
proud of you. And it was my pride
that blinded me. I loved you too
much to see what you were becoming.
What I was turning you into. I'm...
sorry.

NAME: TAI LUNG
I don't want your apology. I want
my scroll!

NAME: SHIFU
Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
halfway across China by now. You
will never see that scroll, Tai
Lung. Never. Never...

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Stairs...

NAME: TAI LUNG
Who are you?

NAME: PO
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
Huhhh...

NAME: TAI LUNG
You?! Him?!
He's a panda.
You're a panda. What are you gonna
do, big guy? Sit on me?

NAME: PO
Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
use this. You want it? Come and get
it.

NAME: TAI LUNG
Finally!

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
That scroll is mine!

NAME: PO
Lightning!

NAME: TAI LUNG
The scroll has given him power.

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
Finally... oh yes... the power of
the Dragon Scroll... is mine!

NAME: TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
It's NOTHING!!

NAME: PO
It's okay. I didn't get it the
first time either.

NAME: TAI LUNG
What?

NAME: PO
There is no secret ingredient. It's
just you.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
Don't! Don't!

NAME: TAI LUNG
You... can't defeat me. You're just
a big, fat panda!

NAME: PO
I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
big, fat panda.

NAME: TAI LUNG
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

NAME: PO
Oh, you know this hold?

NAME: TAI LUNG
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that.

NAME: PO
Nope. I figured it out.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Skadoosh!

NAME: KG SHAW
Look! The Dragon Warrior.

NAME: PO'S DAD
That's my boy. That big, lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

NAME: PO
Thanks, Dad.

NAME: PO (CONT'D)
Hey, guys.

NAME: TIGRESS
Master.

NAME: FURIOUS FIVE
Master.

NAME: PO
Master?
Master Shifu!

NAME: PO
Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?

NAME: SHIFU
Po! You're alive!
Or we're both dead.

NAME: PO
No, Master, I didn't die. I
defeated Tai Lung!

NAME: SHIFU
You did?!

NAME: SHIFU (CONT'D)
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
You are the Dragon Warrior. You
have brought peace to this Valley.
And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
Po. Thank you...

NAME: PO
No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
Shifu. Please...

NAME: SHIFU
I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
peace. Finally.

NAME: PO
Oh. So, um, I should...stop
talking?

NAME: SHIFU
If you can.

NAME: PO
Want to get something to eat?

NAME: SHIFU
Yeah.

NAME: NARRATOR
No one knows where it came from.
There had been others. Mysterious
relics of another world. But only
one with the power to stop the
world.

NAME: NARRATOR
Many vied for its dark magic. A
few brave souls endeavoured to
hide it from those who would use
it for ill. Until finally,
thankfully it was lost to history.

NAME: NARRATOR
Ours is a story of a world that
knows not where it comes from.
That cannot imagine what it is
capable of. Perhaps you can
relate. I know I can.

NAME: INDY
The Black Falcon. I should've
known.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this
place? Must have been a bunch of
lazy hippies, sitting around a
table agreeing with each other.

NAME: INDY
It was built by the ancients.
With more wisdom and artistry than
you can ever know.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
The Kragle...

NAME: INDY
That belongs to the Maker. It
must be protected!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
What a lame boyscout thing to say!
You're standing before the most
powerful object in the world and
you don't want to use it? You're a
real nerd, Indiana Jones.

NAME: INDY
The MasterBuilders will learn of
this.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
And what do you know of them?

NAME: INDY
Only that they will be your
undoing.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French
for ciao.

NAME: INDY
The Black Falcon has the Kragle.

NAME: KRAV M'GA
Gemini. Find the Chosen One.

NAME: GEMINI
Okay.

NAME: INDY
They followed me...

NAME: DORIS
Emmet!

NAME: DORIS
Did you clean your room?! The
cleaning woman is coming today!

NAME: DORIS
Because I want her to know what a
nice rule-following son I have!

NAME: EMMET
Mom!

NAME: DORIS
Aw, it is clean.

NAME: EMMET
It's always clean!

NAME: EMMET
What's the point of having my own
apartment across the hall from
your apartment if you're going to
check up on me like I still live
at home?

NAME: DORIS
I just love you and want my son to
be safe and happy. Can't you work
from home? Like a sociopath or
children's book author?

NAME: EMMET
Mom. I've spent my whole life
here. I need to go out there and
follow my dream of fitting in and
being like everybody else.

NAME: DORIS
My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon
you'll meet a girl and be married!

NAME: EMMET
Mom, please!

NAME: DORIS
I'm just saying, it's been how
many years since Lucy?

NAME: EMMET
Mom... I had the dream again.

NAME: BAD ART TEACHER
Emmet. This wasn't the assignment.
You've got to learn to follow the
rules.

NAME: BAD ART TEACHER
Everyone, the assignment is to
draw your hand, not a silly face.

NAME: KIDS
That's the guys who drew a face. /
What a weirdo. / He doesn't know
how to follow instructions. / He's
not invited to my birthday.

NAME: DORIS
I hated that day. The kids were so
mean, the school tried to expel
you... I promised myself I'd never
let anything like that happen to
you again. And it hasn't. So you
need to let your memory of that
day go. It never happened.

NAME: EMMET
I just want to be normal, Mom.

NAME: DORIS
Listen. You're my son. And you're
the most normal, regular, average
person I know.

NAME: EMMET
You mean it?

NAME: DORIS
Yeah.

NAME: EMMET
Are you crying?

NAME: DORIS
No. Yes. Emmet...

NAME: DORIS
Don't forget dinner.

NAME: EMMET
Promise.

NAME: DORIS
Be safe.

NAME: EMMET
Of course.

NAME: DORIS
Don't make waves.

NAME: EMMET
I never do.

NAME: DORIS
And follow the instructions.

NAME: EMMET
Always.

NAME: DORIS
If they weren't so firm and flush
with your head, I would pinch your
cheeks right now.

NAME: EMMET
Love you, Mom.

NAME: DORIS
Love you.

NAME: EMMET
Yeah. I love this song! And so
does everyone else!

NAME: EMMET
Hello.

NAME: BARRISTA
What'll it be?

NAME: EMMET
I'm Emmet.

NAME: BARRISTA
Larry?

NAME: EMMET
Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee
please.

NAME: BARRISTA
Cappuccino, macchiato, espresso,
americano.

NAME: EMMET
What are those? Sounds a little
foofy.

NAME: BARRISTA
They're all coffee.

NAME: EMMET
Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild.
I don't know, what do you think?

NAME: BARRISTA
A decaf.

NAME: EMMET
Okay, yeah. Cool.

NAME: BARRISTA
Venti, Grande, or Super Grande?

NAME: EMMET
Oh, goodness. So much selection.
So hard to decide! You pick.

NAME: BARRISTA
That's a personal decision that
only you can make.

NAME: EMMET
Uh. Gosh, which is the most
popular?

NAME: BARRISTA
Super Grande. It's Italian for
medium.

NAME: EMMET
Medium. That's what I'm havin'!
That is my style.

NAME: BARRISTA
Fantastic.

NAME: EMMET
You creative types! So
delightfully sardonic!

NAME: BARRISTA
I push one of two buttons on a
machine. I would hardly call that
creative. I would call that
following instructions.

NAME: EMMET
But it says Kreative right on your
shirt! With an extra "kreative"
spelling aberration! I totally
don't get it!

NAME: FOREMAN
Alright, kid. Here's the rules.

NAME: EMMET
Ooh, great.

NAME: FOREMAN
Stay on your feet--

NAME: EMMET
Mmm hmm.

NAME: FOREMAN
Stick to the instructions--

NAME: EMMET
Uh huh.

NAME: FOREMAN
And don't get creative!

NAME: EMMET
Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not
some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!

NAME: FOREMAN
It's Sean.

NAME: FOREMAN
The pieces get sent down from
corporate bundled together with
the instructions. Take the one
with your section on it and follow
it to the letter. Keep track of
all the pieces. If you lose one of
the special ones it'll seriously
drive you crazy.

NAME: FOREMAN
Today you'll be putting together
an artists' loft.

NAME: EMMET
Is it for an artist?

NAME: FOREMAN
Oh, no. It's for an accountant.

NAME: EMMET
Oh, great.

NAME: FOREMAN
Pretty soon, the whole city will
look like this. All part of some
big master plan from Central.

NAME: EMMET
Wow...

NAME: EMMET
What if I mess up or lose my place
or something?

NAME: FOREMAN
Just do what everyone else does.
Keep your head down, follow
instructions, and you could get
promoted. Central's got some big
project coming up overseas.

NAME: EMMET
Overseas? I don't know. I'm not
big on travel.

NAME: FOREMAN
Whatever, kid.

NAME: EMMET
One more question.

NAME: EMMET
Thank you. For making my dreams
come true.

NAME: FOREMAN
Is that a question?

NAME: EMMET
So.

NAME: EMMET
How about that local sports team?
What do you think of how they
played the other day?

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMER
Ugh, they were awful.

NAME: EMMET
Right? They should make a
personnel change of some kind.

NAME: EMMET
Yes, the coach!

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMER
He's the only good thing about
that team.

NAME: EMMET
They should so keep him!

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMER
We're all going to watch the game
after work. Eat a little grub.
Want to join?

NAME: EMMET
Really?!
Actually, I'm supposed to have
dinner with my-- What the heck?
I'm in.

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMER
Alright then.

NAME: EMMET
Cool. Definitely cool.
Hey did you hear that song on the
way in to work this morning?

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMER
Everything is Awesome? I love
that song.

NAME: ANOTHER LUNCHER
Me too!

NAME: EMMET
I think I know why I like that
song so much.

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMER
Why's that?

NAME: EMMET
Because everything is awesome.

NAME: LUNCH CONSUMERS
Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never
thought of it like that.

NAME: FOREMAN
Kid! What the heck is that?!

NAME: EMMET
Oh, uh. I don't know. What?

NAME: FOREMAN
That's not the instructions.

NAME: EMMET
I don't know what happened. I was
just looking out at the clouds,
and-- It was an accident.

NAME: EMMET
Code Danger? What's so dangerous?

NAME: EMMET
Oh.

NAME: POLICEMAN
Loose brick!

NAME: POLICEMAN'S PARTNER
Loose brick!

NAME: POLICE CHIEF
Stop that building!

NAME: EMMET
--unbelievably sorry. I am
honestly the last person who would
do something like thi--

NAME: EMMET
--eriously, a model citizen. I
got straight As. I vote! Even in
the off-year elections, for school
board and stuff--

NAME: EMMET
--swear, I'm not special at all.
Just ask my mom! I'm a totally
average normal person!

NAME: BAD COP
Oh yeah? What size coffee do you
drink?

NAME: EMMET
Super grande.

NAME: BAD COP
Dammit! I can't break him.

NAME: EMMET
You don't need to break me! I'm
just a regular old totally

NAME: EMMET
I'm Emmet. What's your name?

NAME: TV ANCHOR
...we're still following the story
of the construction worker who got
a little creative on his first day
on the job. The subject was
described as looking and acting
exactly like everybody else...
Police have taken the nondescript
suspect into custody, and he is
being held in the city jail.

NAME: EMMET
Mom? What are you doing here?

NAME: DORIS
I'm breaking you out.

NAME: EMMET
But, that's breaking the rules.
You told me never to do that.

NAME: DORIS
Well I'm temporarily reversing my
position for reasons of
convenience.

NAME: EMMET
What?

NAME: DORIS
The rules are different now.

NAME: EMMET
But I did something really bad.

NAME: DORIS
No you didn't.

NAME: EMMET
Mom. You taught me to be a person
of principle, and I stand by my
principles of doing whatever
authority tells me to.

NAME: DORIS
Great. Fine. Would you mind
holding my purse?

NAME: EMMET
Sure.

NAME: EMMET
Wh-- what are you doing?

NAME: DORIS
Saving your life.

NAME: EMMET
Where did you get a blowdart?

NAME: DORIS
That's not important.

NAME: EMMET
Half my body is numb! My hand is
stuck shut! That seems important!

NAME: DORIS
I just broke you out of prison!

NAME: EMMET
For a misdemeanor! They didn't
even decide how long I'd be in
there for yet.

NAME: DORIS
They won't ever decide. You don't

NAME: EMMET
You don't understand! I was
having the best day of my life
today. I was one of the guys. We
were going to go to a dinner and
talk about life and stuff--

NAME: DORIS
You were supposed to have dinner
with me.

NAME: EMMET
I was going to call.

NAME: DORIS
Well it feels amazing to spend
twenty years loving and protecting
someone and the first day out of
the nest they wind up on the news.

NAME: EMMET
I made a mistake. I'll explain it
to the judge tomorrow and
everything will be fine. Only it
won't because I can't because
suddenly I am an ESCAPED FUGITIVE!

NAME: DORIS
It's for your own good.

NAME: EMMET
You can't protect me my whole
life.

NAME: DORIS
You wanna bet? Come on.

NAME: EMMET
Mom, I'm going back to jail to
repay my debt to society. A
society that I would like to be a
part of.

NAME: DORIS
You have to trust me--

NAME: EMMET
You have to trust me! I'm my own
person. You have to let me grow
up and make my own choices--

NAME: DORIS
I tried, and look what happened!

NAME: EMMET
Maybe if you didn't mother me so
much I'd have been a little better
equipped. Ever think of that?

NAME: DORIS
As a matter of fact I did. All
the time.

NAME: EMMET
Ugh. You know what you are, Mom?
You want to really know? A real
pain in the elbow!

NAME: DORIS
Emmet!

NAME: EMMET
Mom? Mom!!!!

NAME: GEMINI
Where did she go?!

NAME: EMMET
What's happening?!

NAME: EMMET
How did you--

NAME: EMMET
My mom got kidnapped by ninjas
then a lady turned a mailbox into
a motorcycle and now we have to
catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.

NAME: BARRISTA
Get in, I guess?

NAME: BARRISTA
What's with the purse?

NAME: DORIS
What do you want with me?!

NAME: DORIS
You have the wrong person!

NAME: EMMET
Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm
going to save you!

NAME: GEMINI
Stop, Emmet! You're going to
screw everything up!

NAME: EMMET
No, I'm not! How do you know my
name?

NAME: LARRY
What the FLIPPING FLIP IS

NAME: EMMET
You're breaking the speed limit,
you know. Not to mention several
other laws, as a well as a few
other things that are not written
into law per se, but are accepted
social practices.

NAME: GEMINI
Emmet.

NAME: EMMET
Lucy?

NAME: LUCY
It's Gemini now.

NAME: EMMET
Are you a DJ?

NAME: LUCY
No.

NAME: EMMET
So, uh, how have the last seven
years been?

NAME: LUCY
Okay.

NAME: DORIS
Emmet?!
Don't you dare hurt him.

NAME: EMMET
So. I have a lot of questions.

NAME: LUCY
Is this really the best time to
talk?

NAME: EMMET
Well, so far...

NAME: LUCY
Fine. Shoot.

NAME: EMMET
Why did those ninjas take my mom?
Why are there ninjas? Are they
robotic ninjas? Where have you
been the last seven years? When
did you gain magical superpowers?
Why did you change your name to
Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you
ask me. Also, have you been
following me around this whole
time? Because that's pretty weird
considering last time I saw you
was when you dumped me for
absolutely no reason.

NAME: BARRISTA
You guys used to date? Nice.

NAME: LUCY
Hardly.

NAME: EMMET
Oh try all of 8th grade!

NAME: BARRISTA
Burn.

NAME: LUCY
By the way, I'm seeing someone
now, so don't get any ideas.

NAME: EMMET
I never have any ideas.

NAME: EMMET
Oh, thank goodness, the police are
here.

NAME: EMMET
Never mind.

NAME: LUCY
You don't get it, do you?

NAME: EMMET
Get what?

NAME: LUCY
They're here for the Chosen One.

NAME: EMMET
The Chosen One? What the heck is
that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep
telling everyone- I'm just a
regular guy!

NAME: LUCY
Not you. Your mom.

NAME: EMMET
Oh. Really?

NAME: LUCY
I was sent to get her, but they
got to her first.

NAME: EMMET
You're sure I'm not the Chosen
One?

NAME: LUCY
Emmet, your mother is the most
powerful being in the universe.

NAME: EMMET
But-- how-- she has cankles!

NAME: LUCY
Don't we all.

NAME: LUCY
She and I belong to an ancient
brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who
create from our imaginations, not
instructions, forced underground
by evil forces. She has long been
in hiding to protect you from
those forces. I was sent to summon
her, but when I showed up she was
too busy breaking you out of
prison.

NAME: EMMET
Okay I did not understand a lot of
that.

NAME: LUCY
Just hold the wheel.

NAME: LUCY
How... Emmet! Jump!

NAME: EMMET
Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

NAME: LUCY
It didn't break. How?

NAME: EMMET
She's gone. I can't believe she's
gone... because she tried to
protect me...?

NAME: BAD COP
Send everyone you can out hunting
for that kid and whoever is trying
to help him. You hear me?!
He's wanted... broken or together.

NAME: LARRY
I need a coffee.

NAME: EMMET
Who exactly are these evil forces
my mom was trying to protect me
from? And why are the cops in
league with robot ninjas?

NAME: LUCY
You have a lot of questions.

NAME: EMMET
I'm just getting warmed up.

NAME: LUCY
They all work for the Black
Falcon.

NAME: EMMET
The Black Falcon?

NAME: LUCY
Otherwise known as Rodrigo
Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?

NAME: EMMET
Empura? I love their stuff.

NAME: LUCY
He is also the self-declared
Emperor of all known LEGO realms.
He kidnapped your mom because she
is the only one who can stop him
from destroying us all.

NAME: EMMET
My mom. My mom?

NAME: LUCY
Emmet, did your mom have a safe
deposit box, a safe, something
where she would have hidden
something very valuable?

NAME: EMMET
No. The only thing she had that
was worth anything was her purse.
She takes it with her everywhere.
Unfortunately it's now melted to
my arm. Ow!

NAME: LUCY
No...no...no...no...no...no...
No...no...no...no...no...no...

NAME: EMMET
Well, I guess it's not in there--

NAME: LUCY
No...no...no...no...no...no...

NAME: LUCY
It's not in there.

NAME: LUCY
What's her birthday?

NAME: EMMET
November twenty-second.

NAME: LUCY
Of course. Your birthday.
January six.

NAME: LUCY
Not by choice.

NAME: LUCY
The MasterPiece.

NAME: EMMET
What is this thing? It's...
beautiful.

NAME: LUCY
Some say it's the first piece
ever. No one knows exactly what it
does, but it is said the Chosen
One will use it to one day save
the world.

NAME: EMMET
And by that you mean my mom.

NAME: LUCY
There's an inscription.

NAME: EMMET
One will come from land afar,
With hand besmirched in shape of star.
One to confront a great forsaker,
And build a bridge to meet the Maker.
This one will make the world right,
But first there'll be an awesome fight.

NAME: LUCY
The prophecy of the Chosen One...

NAME: EMMET
Who is my Mom.

NAME: LUCY
Yes. We have to get this to your
mom so she can fulfill her destiny
and stop the Black Falcon before
he destroys us all.

NAME: EMMET
And if it weren't for me, she'd be
here and everything would be okay.

NAME: CREATURE
Finn? I thought I told you not to
touch anything...

NAME: EMMET
What was that?

NAME: LUCY
What was what?

NAME: LUCY
We have to go. NOW.

NAME: EMMET
Where are we going?!

NAME: LUCY
We're going to take the MasterPiece
to someone who can help.

NAME: EMMET
The MasterBuilders council?

NAME: LUCY
No. They're gone. All of them.

NAME: EMMET
Then who?

NAME: LUCY
Vitruvius. He was once a great
MasterBuilder, now he's...retired.
But he's our only hope.

NAME: EMMET
Can't you do it on your own? You
were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!

NAME: LUCY
I can't, I'm...still in training.
I'm not a full-fledged
MasterBuilder yet. Technically,
I'm an intern.

NAME: EMMET
Well well well--

NAME: EMMET
You're not going to cross the city
limits, are you?

NAME: LUCY
Don't be a putz, Emmet.

NAME: EMMET
Everyone knows you're not allowed
to go Out of Town. It's dangerous,
uncharted and no one should ever go
that's what everybody says. Can't
we just explain the situation to
President Iamnotarobot?

NAME: LUCY
Iamnotarobot is one of the Black
Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever
notice how metallic he looks?

NAME: EMMET
Come on. He's just very fair
skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot"
in his very name! Besides, he's
way better than Councilman
Strawman. That guy is the pits.

NAME: LUCY
Don't be nave.

NAME: EMMET
What's nave?

NAME: LUCY
That.

NAME: LUCY
Look, just give me the MasterPiece
and I'll take it from here.

NAME: EMMET
My mom gave it to me and I'm not
giving it to anyone unless their
name is My Mom.

NAME: LUCY
Well then I guess you're going to
have to cross that line.

NAME: EMMET
Well then I guess I am.

NAME: LUCY
Well then go ahead and do it.

NAME: EMMET
Well then go ahead and do it I
shall.

NAME: LUCY
Dude!

NAME: EMMET
Okay, okay.

NAME: LUCY
Not everything is what it seems...

NAME: EMMET
Who are those guys?

NAME: LUCY
Annoying short whiners. Plus they
reproduce like crazy. It's a real
problem.

NAME: EMMET
Where are we? Where are all the
buildings? And coffee shops?

NAME: LUCY
Legopolis is only one realm in the
Black Falcon's dominion. He built
walls around all of them so he can
keep them separate. If the walls
came down, he'd have a hard time
controlling the results. The
MasterBuilders built secret
passages through the walls so we
could travel between lands.

NAME: EMMET
Who are they?

NAME: LUCY
The Black Falcon's sentries.
They're looking for us.

NAME: EMMET
So he controls all these worlds?

NAME: LUCY
Shh!

NAME: ASSISTANT
The Black Falcon will see you now.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Doris! Did someone get you a
water?

NAME: DORIS
You'll never get away with this.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
"You'll never get away with this!"
What a clich! You don't even know
what it is I'm trying to get away
with. Maybe you should listen
more.

NAME: DORIS
I'm all ears.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Truly? Because listening and
hearing are not the same thing.

NAME: DORIS
I'm listening.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Excellent.
Behold, the Kragle!

NAME: DORIS
The car in the city. That's why
it didn't break...

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Very good. But there's a lot more
to my plan than that. Check it:

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Here is your typical family. You
there. Move your arm a little
higher. A little higher... NO NO
NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are
all PATHETIC LOSERS!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an
inch. You see how hard it is for
me? I have to make all these plans
and rules and enforce them on
people. It's whack-a-mole. I get
one thing perfect, and then
another thing gets messed up. Ay
ay ay I get so tired!

NAME: DORIS
You never did understand the way
of the Maker.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Sure I do. There's one right way
to do everything, and I know it,
and everyone else is wrong and is
trying to screw me up! Until now.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
You. Introduce yourselves to me.

NAME: "DAD"
I'm sorry?

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Like, you say to me "Hello Black
Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my
wife Mary and our children Mark
and Lisa."

NAME: "DAD"
But you just said it.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Well, just-- you say it now.

NAME: "DAD"
Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, this

NAME: BLACK FALCON
My wife Mary.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
And our children...

NAME: "DAD"
And our kids--

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Children.

NAME: "DAD"
And our children Mark and Lisa.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
All together now.

NAME: "DAD"
< SIGH > Hello Black Falcon I'm
Dale, this is my wife Mary and our
children Mark and Lisa.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and
Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm
very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA!
And it's totally permanent!

NAME: DORIS
You want to do this to the whole
world?

NAME: BLACK FALCON
So the whole world will be exactly
how I want.

NAME: DORIS
But-- I'll never see my son again.
No mother will ever see her son.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Unless they're frozen when they
happen to be looking at each
other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so
glad we could finally meet again,
after all these years.

NAME: DORIS
What do you want from me?

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Isn't it obvious? I want you to
make me a better Kragle-Thingy!

NAME: DORIS
That's really dumb.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
I mean this works okay, but it
doesn't have a wide enough spray.
I need to make like a big cloud of
sticky mist. And it's not scary
enough. And I hate the color.

NAME: DORIS
You'll never get aw-- You'll not
achieve that which you have just
described!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
What, do you think your pathetic
son is going to save you or
something? He can't even put two
bricks together.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Did you? I think you protected
him. Because you were afraid to
have him live under the spectre of
being found out. Of being hunted.
You wanted him to fit in. To feel
normal, isn't that right?

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to
that call, he's going to get his
butt kicked. He'll fit in,
alright. Into a coffin!

NAME: DORIS
Leave him out of this!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
I would, but I'm pretty sure he
has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in
your apartment, and it's not on
you. But your son seems to have
interesting taste in handbags.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
So, just to tie up all the loose
ends, I'll have to kill him and
take the MasterPiece so the
prophecy will never come true.

NAME: DORIS
No! Don't, please! I'll do what
you want, please don't hurt him.

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do
what I want regardless. I'll
simply use my very special
electromagnetic machine to extract
your thoughts and steal your ideas
like I've done for all the other
imprisoned MasterBuilders.

NAME: DORIS
No!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!

NAME: EMMET
Is it much farther?

NAME: LUCY
Do you ever say something that
isn't a stupid question?

NAME: EMMET
What's that supposed to mean?

NAME: LUCY
I guess not.

NAME: LUCY
That's Dragon.

NAME: EMMET
Who could live here?

NAME: LUCY
A blind man.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Hello! What? Hi!

NAME: EMMET
I see.

NAME: EMMET
Lovely place.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Thank you. I am deprived of my
sight, but my hearing is so acute
that I can still perceive the
physical world using echolocation.

NAME: EMMET
Like an old bat...

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Precisely. I see with my ears.
Now, how can I help you, extremely
tall and fat stranger?

NAME: EMMET
My mother has been kidnapped and
it's all my fault.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.

NAME: LUCY
His mother is the Chosen One. I
was sent to summon her. The Black
Falcon got to her first. He has
the Kragle.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Oh my. That is grave news indeed.
But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm
sure the active MasterBuilders are
more than adequate.

NAME: LUCY
The other MasterBuilders are gone.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
I guess I'm not redundant anymore.

NAME: EMMET
Why is he being so weird?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
The Black Falcon was my student.

NAME: TEEN DORIS
Hey Rod. What's that?

NAME: TEEN BLACK FALCON
An awesome secret lair, b'doy!
It's the best thing I've ever
built. It's perfect. All I need
now is a cool nickname.

NAME: TEEN BLACK FALCON
No! My precious precious work!

NAME: LESS OLD VITRUVIUS
Building is rebuilding, Rodrigo.
You must learn to embrace the
practice, not the outcome.

NAME: TEEN BLACK FALCON
What a bunch of bunk! That thing
was AWESOME!

NAME: VITRUVIUS
They were probably right.

NAME: EMMET
You taught my parents...

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Your mother went into hiding to
protect you. Your father never had
a chance...

NAME: LUCY
Vitruvius, you can still help us.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
That's flattery, my dear. We both
know you're only here because you
have no other place to go.

NAME: EMMET
We're here because we don't know
what to do and you might. Sir, all
I've ever wanted was to get along
with everyone and be a part of the
world and now I don't know if
there's going to be a world to be
a part of. That is, unless you
help me fix it. And I bet if you
do, they'll forget all about what
they used to think of you.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
I wish I could, young man, but he
has the Kragle, and he has the
Chosen One, and if he has the
Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece.
And without that, there is no--

NAME: LUCY
Hope?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
The Kragle is the most powerful
relic of the Maker.

NAME: EMMET
Who is this Maker you guys keep
talking about?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
The Maker. The being who put us
all together and watches over us.
Only by following the inspiration
of the Maker can one become a true
MasterBuilder.

NAME: EMMET
Okay that sounds super weird.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
It is, but then all the best
things are.

NAME: EMMET
And what's the Kragle again?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Every so often, the Maker drops a
piece down to us that is unique,
unlike any other. This crystal
table is but one example. Some of
them, in the wrong hands, can be
weaponized. The Kragle, if
harnessed, could--

NAME: EMMET
--destroy the world?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Yes. The Black Falcon has taken
your mother, the one person who
can stop him, and imprisoned her.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
If we can travel across sea and
land, penetrate his heavily-
guarded fortress, unkidnap Master
Doris, and bring the MasterPiece
safely to her, she can use it to
destroy the Kragle, and set the
world right.

NAME: EMMET
Oh is that all we have to do? That
doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I
forgot to mention, I am saying
this with a sarcastic inflection.

NAME: LUCY
That's super constructive, thank
you.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
We need to assemble a team of all
remaining MasterBuilders hiding
throughout the lands. We'll scour
the countryside high and low,
overturning rocks, hiding from
sentries, avoiding the major roads
and air..

NAME: LUCY
We don't have that kind of time!

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Or we could send out a mass email
to the MasterBuilders list, and
have whichever ones are remaining
meet us at the midpoint.

NAME: EMMET
Better.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
And then, we sail for the Land of
Unused Parts!
Anybody got a ship?

NAME: EMMET
How long has your boyfriend had
his own ship?

NAME: LUCY
Why do you care?

NAME: EMMET
I just think it's interesting that
you're attracted to someone with
his own vessel. Fairly superficial
to date a guy with his own yacht.

NAME: LUCY
It's not exactly a yacht.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!

NAME: EMMET
Huh. Not what I expected.

NAME: EMMET
Really not what I expected.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Arr! Come give your weary
boyfriend a kiss!

NAME: EMMET
Wow.

NAME: EMMET
Okay. That's-- okay.

NAME: LUCY
Gosh, where are my manners?
Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my
boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is
Emmet. We used to date a million
zillion years ago. It meant
nothing to me. You have heard of
Vitruvius, of course.

NAME: NECKBEARD
You're the teacher that made the
Black Falcon who he is, then?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
That was a long time ago.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Farrr be it for a pirate to judge
a man with an unsavory reputation.

NAME: EMMET
That's surprisingly gracious--

NAME: NECKBEARD
Stay away from me lady.

NAME: EMMET
Alright. Sure.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Say that to my face.

NAME: EMMET
Alright. Sure.

NAME: NECKBEARD
I was once the most feared
MasterBuilder in all the lands. I
lost the rest of me body fighting
off a hundred of the Black Falcon's
men. You cross me, and I'll make it
an even fight, if you follow.

NAME: EMMET
Thank you for your clarity.

NAME: LUCY
He has an incredible mind.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Everyone hop aboard. Meet me crew.
This be Orangebeard, Brownbeard
and Nobeard, and me First Mate,
Chewbacca. You can call him
Allbeard.

NAME: NECKBEARD
The route be stuffed to the gills
with Empura shipping activity.
It's heavily patrolled. We'll
have to be keeping an eye open,
and when the time be right, make
ourrrr move.

NAME: EMMET
What's our move?

NAME: NECKBEARD
I'm sorry, did the Captain say you
could finish swabbing the deck?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Lucy. Welcome.

NAME: EMMET
It's Emmet.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?

NAME: EMMET
Yes. What are you doing?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Making.

NAME: EMMET
What's it for?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
What is anything for? It's what
we were all meant to do. What the
Maker has fated us to do.

NAME: EMMET
Okay, here's what I don't get. If
our lives really are predetermined
by some all-controlling dude, what
is the point of doing anything?

NAME: EMMET
OW! Why did you do that?!

NAME: VITRUVIUS
The Maker fated me to.

NAME: EMMET
Or you did it yourself because
you're a crazy person.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Ah. Now, you're learning.

NAME: EMMET
I could just never make something
like that. How did you even get
the idea?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
I didn't. I just opened a window
for it to fly through.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Birds are, incidentally, one of
the most creative of all the
animals. They build nests.
Create elaborate courtship
rituals, make gifts for one
another. And of course, their
beautiful songs.

NAME: EMMET
Teach me.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Open your throat and make a
sound.

NAME: EMMET
No. Teach me to do what you do.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
How can I teach you something you
already know? It's already inside
you. You've walled it up, but it
still shines through. That
terrific disaster you caused at
the instruction site? That was no
accident.

NAME: EMMET
I'm not sure I follow...

NAME: VITRUVIUS
They say every night the Maker
puts a blanket over the world, a
blanket with tiny holes. Some call
them stars, but I call them
MakerPeepers.

NAME: EMMET
MakerPeepers?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a
time, before you were born, when
making new things came as
naturally to everyone as
breathing. The world was messy and
wild, and that made it beautiful.
But then, everything became rigid
and prefabricated, so everyone
just stopped thinking of new
things. Making has been outsourced
to Empura. The Black Falcon has
paved over the world that was.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
And yet, somehow, light still
shines through the cracks.

NAME: EMMET
Oh no! Wait!
It got out...

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Isn't that marvelous? You have an
idea, and then off it goes!

NAME: BAD COP
That's them. Man your weapons.
Full steam ahead.

NAME: ROBOVIKING
We don't use steam. We row.

NAME: BAD COP
Fine. Full row ahead.

NAME: NECKBEARD
They're a-comin'! Dive!

NAME: EMMET
What are they doing?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Collaborating.

NAME: LUCY
Vitruvius, follow my lead.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Mateys! Be me hands and legs!
Start taking the ship apart!

NAME: EMMET
But we'll sink!

NAME: LUCY
That's the idea.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Put the four-piece over there.
No! The skinny one. Come on!

NAME: EMMET
I don't get it-- What do I do?

NAME: LUCY
Build a hatch.

NAME: EMMET
Like for an attic?

NAME: LUCY
Like for a submarine.

NAME: LUCY
That's as far as you got?!

NAME: EMMET
Well...

NAME: NECKBEARD
Heading?

NAME: CHEWBACCA
Arrrrrrrr.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Get deeper. If we're too high
their sensorrrs will detect us.

NAME: BAD COP
Nothing? But they were right here.

NAME: ROBOVIKING
Wait. There's something on the
scanner.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Dive! Dive! Dive!

NAME: ROBOVIKING
Nothing. There's nothing.

NAME: BAD COP
Let me see that... DAMMIT!

NAME: ROBOVIKING
Hey, watch it man, I built that.

NAME: EMMET
Hey Lucy, you gotta see--

NAME: GROWN UP
Where are my dang keys? Finn, have
you been playing in here?

NAME: KID
No.

NAME: GROWN UP
You sound like you are lying. Are
you lying?

NAME: KID
No.

NAME: GROWN UP
NAME: VERY NOT-ABLE-TO-BE-TOUCHED-BY-
Okay, this is my very special
area, where I play with something
anyone, because it is the most
awesome thing I have ever made.

NAME: KID
Uncle Ted, why don't you have a
girlfriend?

NAME: GROWN UP
Because you need money for
girlfriends. Although they refuse
to admit that. Although they
admit it implicitly when they
leave you for a banker.

NAME: KID
Why don't you have a job?

NAME: GROWN UP
Look, you can do anything you want
with this big bin of parts, okay?
Just promise me you aren't going
to play in my special areas
anymore.

NAME: KID
Okay.

NAME: GROWN UP
Is that a real okay or a fake one?

NAME: KID
Real.

NAME: GROWN UP
Okay. That's my man.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Legotopia. The last free kingdom
in the universe.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Thank you.

NAME: EMMET
Does the Black Falcon know about
this place?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
It's been hidden for ages by the
fog and its remote location. Plus
they have elaborate security
measures.

NAME: DOOR FACE
Who goes there?

NAME: EMMET
Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex-
girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man,
a pirate head, and a loud dog.
We're here to save the world.

NAME: DOOR FACE
Well, I've never heard of you, but
come on in!

NAME: LUCY
That's the security?

NAME: KING KARL
Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my
Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!

NAME: EMMET
For Kreativity...

NAME: KING KARL
Exaktly!

NAME: EMMET
Why did you build all this stuff?

NAME: KING KARL
Well...Why not?

NAME: KING KARL
If you can conceive it, we will
achieve it. Build anything
whenever you feel it.

NAME: EMMET
You know we really don't have time--

NAME: KING KARL
Invent a game, like Roller
Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting
Tennis tickets...

NAME: KING KARL
Just wide!

NAME: NECKBEARD
This is me favorite sport.

NAME: KING KARL
We only teach art and music in
school so kids feel unencumbered.
No spelling, reading, science or
math, we just make up all the
numbers!

NAME: KING KARL
Make any idea thought or spoken.
Rules were meant to be broken!

NAME: EMMET
No, rules were meant to be
followed.

NAME: CHORUS
We have everything and nothing and
something's all we've got. Why,
you ask? What you should ask is...
Why not?!!!!

NAME: EMMET
You guys are really weird.

NAME: KING KARL
Cool, man, thank you.

NAME: EMMET
This is crazy. You can't have a
society without rules. I mean,
your castle doesn't look very
structurally sound at all!

NAME: KING KARL
Who is this guy?

NAME: LUCY
Emmet. He doesn't get out much.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Emmet, these people are not
MasterBuilders. They do not create
with purpose, they create just to
create. But they can also be very
inspiring, because the only way to
accomplish the impossible is to
break the rules of what is
possible.

NAME: EMMET
I wish that made sense to me.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
It will if you let it.
King Karl, I wish we came to you
with better news.

NAME: KING KARL
As do I. The others arrived just
before you, which gave us a chance
to rehearse the song. Follow me.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Ar! What a bounty! I be starrrving!

NAME: KING KARL
Meet your team.

NAME: BATMAN
Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email.
On my Batphone. Which I invented.
Gets emails. On a phone.

NAME: EMMET
Hello.

NAME: LUCY
And where do you come from?

NAME: LUCY
Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?

NAME: KING KARL
No. But he wants to help.

NAME: BATMAN
I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot
of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets?

NAME: LUCY
No thank you.

NAME: BENNY
I'm also a MasterBuilder.

NAME: EMMET
Cool!

NAME: BENNY
I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where
are you from? I'm from space.
There's not a lot of oxygen up
there. One time I was fixing my
ship in space and there was a
crack in my helmet. They say I
should've died or gotten Space
Madness but I didn't die. I'm
here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen
my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it
doesn't fly for some reason.

NAME: EMMET
Um, maybe if it didn't have two
fronts and no back, and it didn't
have five wings.

NAME: BENNY
I love wings. Wings are great,
right?

NAME: NECKBEARD
He seems a little distracted.

NAME: BENNY
What? Where?

NAME: LUCY
Is this everyone?

NAME: BENNY
Oh, no. There's one more. My co-
pilot Moppy. He's really organized.

NAME: BENNY
Hi Moppy.
Hi everybody. Did you meet my
friend Benny? He's the best.
That's too nice of you, Mopper.
He can really help you with your
quest.
Well, I don't know.
He gets real lonely sometimes.
Moppy!
It's true. He was all alone in
space. He tried to look for his
space friends but couldn't find
them. No one is left but me. Him.

NAME: EMMET
What did you say you do again?

NAME: BENNY
Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First
Class.

NAME: EMMET
Ah.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
We are all that remain of the once
proud society of MasterBuilders.
Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's
not a MasterBuilder, he's just the
son of one. And Lucy, who is still
an intern.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Along with a blind man, a pirate
head, a crazy spaceman, and
Batman...

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Together, we form a fellowship of
the MasterPiece. A shining beacon
of possibility, and the only thing
that can counteract the power of
the Kragle. If we can get this
into the hands of the Chosen One--

NAME: BAD COP
Or didn't you know that as a
former student of MasterBuilder
academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd
on your mass email?

NAME: KING KARL
I'm sorry, I had to let them in.

NAME: LUCY
King Karl! You betrayed us! You
betrayed everything you stand for!

NAME: KING KARL
Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia
had run up like a bunch of debt.
Something about lots of spending
and no revenue. Empura promised
to fund the whole place.
Honestly, I'm super sorry.

NAME: EMMET
This guy is supposed to be
inspiring? More like conspiring...
with a bunch of mean jerks who
have my mom! You're just as bad as
them, you big mean jerk!

NAME: KING KARL
Come on. Guys.

NAME: KING KARL
Where are you taking them? Not to
the dungeon, right? You said--

NAME: BAD COP
Do I look like a medieval
constable? No, they're going
someplace much worse. Take them
to... the conference room!

NAME: BAD COP
Okay we're good to teleconference.

NAME: VOLUME? IT'S NOT WORKING!
OH THERE IT GOES! Can you
hear me? How about now? How about now? How

NAME: BAD COP
Just, point the camera at you.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
I can't see anything.

NAME: BAD COP
No, the other way. There. That's
close enough.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Oh I see you! I see your hand.
Wave your hand. Ha ha! This is
amazing! Do you hear a weird echo
on your end? I can hear myself but
like two seconds later. Echo.
Echo. This is my voiceeeeeoooooo
aaaaayyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeee...

NAME: BAD COP
Sir.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Okay. Well well well, it looks
like I have you all right where I
want you. Good morning Vitruvius.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the
Maker!

NAME: LUCY
No no he's just on teleconference.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
What?

NAME: LUCY
It's like a phone. A telegram.
He's not actually in the room.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Like a crystal ball?

NAME: LUCY
Sure.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Still being schooled by your
students, I see.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
I thought you might want to know
that my good friend Doris here is
safe and sound, so you don't have
anything to worry about.

NAME: DORIS
Emmet!

NAME: EMMET
Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you
down. Any more than I already
have!

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
You've done enough, haven't you
sonny? After all, your mother is
now a distinguished member of my

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Every MasterBuilder in the world
is in this tank, having their
ideas extracted. Now, with the
ideas of the Chosen One, I can
finally build the best
Kraglethingy in the world, freeze
everything, and make the universe
exactly how I like it forever.

NAME: EMMET
Mom! No!

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
There's nothing you can do, dude.
I already have the ideas. My
builders are putting the finishing
touches right now. What are you
going to show up here in the next
twenty four hours and stop me?
You just gave me the only hope you
had! You see this?

NAME: BLACK FALCON
These are all the lands I control!
They are perfect! And they are
going to be that way forever! Now
that you can't mess any of them
up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: LUCY
So wait. What was the purpose of
this call then?

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
To gloat. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha PEACE.

NAME: EMMET
You're a MasterBuilder, too?

NAME: KING KARL
I dabble. You were right. I'd
rather be poor and free than
comfortable and stuck.

NAME: KING KARL
Bring it on.

NAME: KING KARL
Prepare for battle!

NAME: KING KARL
On my mark.

NAME: BAD COP
Charge.

NAME: KING KARL
Charge!

NAME: KING KARL
Retreat!

NAME: KING KARL
You have to go.

NAME: EMMET
We can't leave you here.

NAME: KING KARL
It's my place to be here. Go!

NAME: BENNY
Everyone get in my spaceship!

NAME: EMMET
Over there!

NAME: LUCY
We have to go now!

NAME: EMMET
I built that chair! Check it out.
That's my chair. Pretty good.

NAME: LUCY
That's far more impressive than
this entire Rocket-Copter.

NAME: EMMET
Well, it was my idea to get in the
catapult.

NAME: LUCY
A credit hog. Great.

NAME: BATMAN
Where'd this thing come from?

NAME: EMMET
No idea.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Bogey on our six!

NAME: BENNY
Hey look at that over there--

NAME: LUCY
Benny! Focus!

NAME: NECKBEARD
There!

NAME: EMMET
My chair!!!!

NAME: BATMAN
I say we camp here for the night
in this creepy Old West Ghost
Town.

NAME: LUCY
What's up?

NAME: EMMET
Can't sleep. Kind of still upset
about everything, you know?

NAME: LUCY
Upset about what?

NAME: EMMET
Well, I got in a fight with my mom
that caused her to get kidnapped
and the whole world is about to
get frozen, if you must know,
unless you were asking that
sarcastically, which I now realize
you were.

NAME: LUCY
Sorry.

NAME: LUCY
We'll find her.

NAME: EMMET
I hope so.

NAME: LUCY
I know it. I know you.

NAME: EMMET
I thought you said I didn't have a
creative bone in my body.

NAME: LUCY
You don't.

NAME: EMMET
That's nice, thank you.

NAME: LUCY
I'm just trying to help.

NAME: EMMET
You know what you are, Lucy?

NAME: LUCY
What?

NAME: EMMET
A real pain in the elbow.

NAME: EMMET
What?

NAME: LUCY
You may not have a creative bone
in your body, but you have a lot
of really really earnest bones.
You always did.

NAME: EMMET
Thank you?

NAME: LUCY
I mean, that day when we were
kids, and you drew the face in art
class, you inspired me. I thought
maybe there was more out there in
the world, and maybe you felt the
same. That's why I asked you out.
But then you ended up like
everyone else and broke my heart,
you know? That I was going one way
and you didn't go with me.

NAME: EMMET
Think of how I felt. My mom
trained me to follow the herd. To
lay low. All I ever wanted was to
fit in, to have friends. And the
funny thing is, maybe I was trying
too hard, but, my whole life, I
never did have any real friends.

NAME: LUCY
We're being so dramatic. It was
eighth grade!

NAME: EMMET
That's the most dramatic time in
anyone's life, right? It's what
made The Black Falcon such a world
class dingaling.

NAME: LUCY
It made a lot of us dingalings.

NAME: EMMET
Yeah.

NAME: LUCY
You know, whenever I doubt myself,
I look into this prism I found
long ago...

NAME: EMMET
It's... beautiful.

NAME: LUCY
I know. It's a relic of the Maker.
When I'm feeling low, I look at
it, and it always makes me feel
like there still is beauty in the
world, and we all have a purpose.
You know what I mean?

NAME: EMMET
Yeah. I do.

NAME: LUCY
Well, good night.

NAME: EMMET
Yeah. Okay.

NAME: TED
Finn? What did you do to the
spaceship? It's in pieces! I
told you not to play with this and
you broke it! It took me years to
build all this!

NAME: TED (CONT'D)
And what's it doing in the Old
West Town? And is that Batman? It
doesn't belong here!

NAME: FINN
I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just
wanted to play.

NAME: TED
Well, life isn't all play.
Sometimes it's serious and it gets
screwed up and you don't feel like
playing. You just wish for once
everything was in the right place.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
I don't suppose this is the
restroom?

NAME: EMMET
No. Definitely not.
Hey, Can I ask you something? I
keep having these strange dreams
about a squishy bumpy giant--

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Visions of the Maker. Quite
unusual.

NAME: EMMET
What does it mean? Do I have a
fate?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
We all have a fate. But
MasterBuilding is about channeling
the power of the Maker, and taking
that fate into our own hands. I
guess it could mean what you
choose to make it mean.

NAME: EMMET
Why do you always talk in weird
riddles? I just want answers.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Then why don't you try building
something for yourself?

NAME: EMMET
I'm sorry, that's lame.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Not bad. You're learning now.

NAME: EMMET
No I'm not. I'm just copying what
you did.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
A dilettante borrows. A true
artist steals.

NAME: EMMET
That makes no sense!

NAME: VITRUVIUS
And all this does?

NAME: LUCY
How the heck are we going to do
this?

NAME: EMMET
It's okay. I have a plan.

NAME: LUCY
Really?

NAME: EMMET
This R2 unit had the plans for
Empura Tower stored in its memory
bank.

NAME: LUCY
That's convenient.

NAME: EMMET
Looking over it last night, I
noticed the tower follows the same
construction principles as the
condos I was building back in
Legopolis.

NAME: EMMET
Wait.

NAME: LUCY
What about this?

NAME: LUCY
Darn.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
How about this?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
What, is it because I'm blind?

NAME: BATMAN
Check this out:

NAME: LUCY
Stop it! Everyone!

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Creativity in groups is hard.

NAME: LUCY
We don't have time for that.

NAME: EMMET
Or we can just wing it.

NAME: SERVICE NINJA
Well, I don't know, I've lived
alone a long time, and sharing
space with you is a new thing for
me...no it's not like that...
Hey, we didn't order any--

NAME: LUCY
I love you please move in with me.

NAME: EMMET
The Black Falcon's office!

NAME: BATMAN
My office is bigger.

NAME: LUCY
Emmet.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Arr, his appointment book be
saying he be scheduled for a
massage at four.

NAME: BATMAN
He'll get a flipping massage
alright.

NAME: DAD
Language! There are kids here.

NAME: BATMAN
Who are these nerds?

NAME: SON
We, uh, can't move.

NAME: LUCY
They won't budge.

NAME: DAUGHTER
The bad guy is going to freeze
everyone.

NAME: MOM
Kids? Are you okay?

NAME: DAD
They're alright, baby.

NAME: SON
I miss you, mom.

NAME: EMMET
Me too.
This is really sad. How can you
keep living like this?

NAME: DAD
Well, yeah, we can't be together.
We can't touch or see each other.
But in here-- and if I could, I'd
be pointing to my head-- I'm not
stuck. In my brain we're sharing
a delicious meal together.

NAME: MOM
Thank you sweetie.

NAME: DAUGHTER
Pass the mustard.

NAME: LUCY
That's pretty elaborate.

NAME: DAD
They can freeze you. They can tell
you what to do. But they can't
stop our secret weapon. Ideas.
Now go give `em hell.

NAME: EMMET
Wait. Batman, give me your
Batperiscope.

NAME: EMMET
Now at least you can see each
other.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
You there. Listen to me.

NAME: NINJA
You have grown a beard.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
I be trying it out. What do ye
think?

NAME: NINJA
It's very nice.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
Thank you. Arr.

NAME: NINJA
Is there something in your throat,
sir?

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
Yes. It be a new throat something
I'm trying out. Do ye like it?

NAME: NINJA
Very much.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
Say, I beed wondering if you could
do me a favor.

NAME: NINJA
At your service, commander.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
Take off your ninja clothes.

NAME: NINJA
Sir?

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
I be the boss, ain't I be?

NAME: NINJA
Yes, sir.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
Now pull each other's heads off
and kick them way down the hallway
where you can't see them anymore.

NAME: NINJA
Yes, sir-- ow!

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
Very good. Now count to one
thousand.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
This be awesome.

NAME: ROBOSKELETON
Black Falcon? You're supposed to
be at your massage.

NAME: "THE BLACK FALCON"
I uh...

NAME: EMMET
Mom...

NAME: DORIS
What? Emmet?

NAME: EMMET
It's me, Mom. I've here to save
you, so you can save the world.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
Rodrigo Falcone. My old student.
It's time you went back to SCHOOL!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
The old dog still has a few
tricks. But I guess your friends
didn't tell you that I was flanked
by like a hundred soldiers. Now!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Get the rest of them!

NAME: LUCY
Why won't anything in this hallway
break off?!

NAME: BATMAN
It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!

NAME: NECKBEARD
Lucy.

NAME: LUCY
Yes?

NAME: NECKBEARD
I want you to know, I love you.

NAME: LUCY
Me too...

NAME: NECKBEARD
And even if the world be ending,
and we all get frozen, I'd feel
better about the whole situation
if I could get frozen with you as
my bride.

NAME: LUCY
Are you really doing this?

NAME: NECKBEARD
Lucy. Will you take me hand in
marriage? Metaphorically.

NAME: LUCY
Um...

NAME: NECKBEARD
Lucy!

NAME: EMMET
Mom! Hurry!

NAME: EMMET
No!

NAME: DORIS
No!

NAME: BATMAN
We can't win this. We've got to
hide and make a new plan.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Arrr!

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Aw how cute. Mother and son...
together at last. And what's this?

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
I've been looking for a
paperweight.
Did you really think you were
going to come up here and save the
day? You're a follower, my
friend. You don't have the stuff.
And you. You must be real proud
of this one, huh? He's a credit
to the family. Just like his
talentless father.

NAME: EMMET
Mom, I'm so sorry.

NAME: DORIS
I know sweetie.

NAME: EMMET
Just- tell me everything's going
to be okay.

NAME: DORIS
I wish I could, son.

NAME: EMMET
Mom... Why didn't you -- why
didn't you teach me what you knew?

NAME: DORIS
I wanted you to be safe. I thought
you would be happier. When I saw
you with that funny drawing, it
was so marvelous. And then I
thought of what your life would
be, how everyone would treat you.
I just couldn't let that happen.

NAME: EMMET
I know you're the Chosen One, but--
I just wish you had let me choose
for myself.

NAME: DORIS
I...I don't know what to say.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
You guys want to see it? Let me
take you up to the construction
site! Things are about to get a
little sticky down here.

NAME: EMMET
They got promoted...

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Behold: The SuperKragleThingy
Part II.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
It's my best work.

NAME: EMMET
But you didn't do anything.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Are you kidding? You think the
MasterBuilders just up and forced
themselves to think of this? Did
those guys force themselves to
build it? No. I did. Ergo, it's
mine.
Look down there.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Magnificent, isn't it? And now it
will be just the way I want.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Release the Kragle!

NAME: BATMAN
That does not look good.

NAME: NECKBEARD
When do we get to the part about
coming up with a plan?

NAME: BENNY
I've got a plan.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Uh-oh.

NAME: NECKBEARD
What about Lucy and the others?

NAME: BENNY
We'll come back for them. After we
stop that Kragle.

NAME: BENNY
Can we go in the blue one?

NAME: BAD COP
There they are!

NAME: NECKBEARD
What does it matter?

NAME: BENNY
I fly better in blue.

NAME: BAD COP
No! Re-open the door! Everyone in
ships! Go!

NAME: ROBONINJA
Dude, you don't have to yell.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Left. Right. Straight. Now
stand up super tall and scary!

NAME: HOBBIT
Every time!--

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Bahahahahahahaha!!

NAME: DORIS
It's too horrible to bear.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
What is? Describe it to me. I
feel really really left out!

NAME: EMMET
The world is ending.

NAME: BATMAN
Go down to the city! What are you
doing?

NAME: BENNY
Calling for help from my space
friends!

NAME: NECKBEARD
What, a bunch of mops? There be no
space friends! Just go!

NAME: BENNY
Alright, you don't have to be mean
about it.

NAME: LARRY
< SIGH > Of course.

NAME: OTHER COFFEE GUY
What the heck is happening?

NAME: LARRY
I think a big dinobot is freezing
everything with mucusy sneezes.

NAME: OTHER COFFEE GUY
So we're doomed? What do we do?

NAME: LARRY
I don't know. Complain?

NAME: LARRY
I mean, it's not like we can do
anything.

NAME: OTHER COFFEE GUY
How annoying.

NAME: LARRY
Wait a minute...

NAME: OTHER COFFEE GUY
What are you doing?

NAME: LARRY
I don't know exactly. I'm just
going with it.

NAME: OTHER COFFEE GUY
Larry. My goodness.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
What?! This is terrible! I can't
see!
No offense.
Who the heck did that?

NAME: LUCY
That guy?!

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Hey! Guys! Swipe! Swipe! No!
You're doing it wrong! Ugh...
This is a disaster!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Do I smell something burning? It
smells like a tire fire in here.

NAME: DORIS
I... don't know what to do. So
tired...

NAME: LUCY
She's too weak. You have to do it.

NAME: EMMET
Do what? What can I do?

NAME: LUCY
I believe in you, Emmet. I was
mad because you disappointed me
for a while, but since it wasn't
your fault, I'm willing to give
you a mulligan on it.

NAME: EMMET
A what?

NAME: LUCY
A mulligan. It's from golf.

NAME: EMMET
You play golf?

NAME: LUCY
The point is, you've spent your
whole life wanting to fit in and
have friends, by pretending to be
something you're not. But now that
you've let the real you shine
through, you've made some friends
who like you for who you are. And
even if they're just a crazy
spaceman and a pirate head and a
blind man and an intern--

NAME: EMMET
You like me?

NAME: LUCY
I do.

NAME: EMMET
Neckbeard likes me?

NAME: LUCY
...Sure.

NAME: EMMET
But... I'm not the Chosen One.

NAME: LUCY
You wanted to make your own
choices, right? So choose
yourself.

NAME: EMMET
Nuh uh.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Wait, what's going on?! What the
hell are you smiling about?!

NAME: EMMET
This.

NAME: DORIS
What is it, Emmet?

NAME: EMMET
I don't know. It just came to me.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
You have channeled the Maker and
chosen your fate. You have chosen
to be the Chosen One.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
You are going to defeat me by
making some kind of art? Ha ha
ha! Oh let me put on my Pink
Floyd album so I can totally zone
out! Ha ha ha this is so lame!

NAME: BLACK FALCON
Whoa. That was weird.

NAME: LARRY
What the heck is that?!

NAME: BENNY
Wow, that thing is really big.

NAME: NECKBEARD
Uh, Benny...

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Get that spaceship out of there! I
don't want to freeze space stuff
in the city--OOF!

NAME: LUCY
What do we do?

NAME: DORIS
Go after him.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
If you want to get something done,
you have to do it yourself!!!

NAME: LARRY
Quick, everyone! Run behind it!
Get away from the mist!

NAME: DOCTOR
It's a b--

NAME: EMMET
So...not square.

NAME: EMMET
The Maker. It's all real...

NAME: EMMET TED
It just tried to kill me! It just tried to kill me!

NAME: TED
What the heck are you?!

NAME: EMMET
What the heck are you?!

NAME: TED
I'm a person.

NAME: EMMET
I'm a person. You on the other
hand are a giant squishy beast.

NAME: TED
You're a talking toy. This is
considerably less cute than I have
been led to believe.

NAME: EMMET
So ugly...

NAME: EMMET
What are these?!

NAME: TED
Calm down! Where did you come
from?

NAME: EMMET
Did you build that?

NAME: TED
Yeah, but it's seriously messed
up.

NAME: EMMET
Are you the Maker?

NAME: TED
The what?

NAME: FINN
What?

NAME: TED
Are you seeing this?

NAME: FINN
Yeah.

NAME: EMMET
Two Makers?

NAME: TED
How did this-- what is-- my sets,

NAME: FINN
The guys. They needed my help.

NAME: TED
Against what?

NAME: FINN
Against the Kragle.

NAME: TED
The what?

NAME: EMMET
The Kragle. The thing that is
freezing everything together.

NAME: TED
Oh. Krazy Glue?

NAME: EMMET
Good Lord.

NAME: TED
What? I'm using this to glue my
set together. So it won't get
messed up by the kid.

NAME: EMMET
But then-- it can never change.

NAME: TED
Exactly. It's the only thing in
my life that's perfect.

NAME: TED (CONT'D)
I can't find a job that doesn't
make me hate myself. My
girlfriend dumped me for a rich
trustafarian... dingaling, is what
he is, and I'm watching my
sister's kid while she has a fun
time partying in the Hamptons with
her annoying brood of hot
girlfriends who won't have a thing
to do with me, and the only thing
I have in my life that makes any
sense, that I have any control
over is that perfect world right
there.

NAME: EMMET
But... nothing is perfect unless
it can change. You can make
something, you know, and it can be
great, for a while, but then...
then someone maybe adds to it,
makes something new out of it. And
that keeps happening until it
becomes something that a single
person could never envision. Truth
is, creating alone is never as
good as creating with others.

NAME: TED
See. No. That's not true-
because with others, they don't
see things the same way, so--

NAME: EMMET
I know. You want to control
everything. I get it. But if you
succeed, in the end, all you'll
ever have is what you've got.

NAME: TED
What else could I have?

NAME: EMMET
Who knows? That's the best part.

NAME: TED
Use this.

NAME: EMMET
What is it?

NAME: TED
What is it? It's the ca--

NAME: FINN
Cone of Power. It's called the
Cone of Power.

NAME: TED
Okay. The Cone of Power.

NAME: FINN
Put it on the Kragle to stop it.

NAME: TED
Yeah. Try that.

NAME: EMMET
Thank you. It was nice to meet
you both, disgusting squishy giant
Maker creature and smaller,
messier giant Maker creature.

NAME: FINN
Nice to meet you.

NAME: EMMET
I should go save the world now.

NAME: TED
Let's play.

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Detach and mobilize! Stop that
loser!

NAME: BENNY
Hello!

NAME: EMMET
Thanks for dropping in.

NAME: BATMAN
I hope we're not imposing.

NAME: BATMAN
There's too many of them!

NAME: NECKBEARD
They're coming at us from all
sides!

NAME: BENNY
Guy! Look up! My space friends!
They got my message!

NAME: HAN SOLO
Anything for you, Benny!

NAME: NECKBEARD
Lucy!

NAME: LUCY
Neckbeard! We need to talk...

NAME: LARRY
I could build such a better ship
than that.

NAME: OTHER COFFEE GUY
Why don't we?

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Didn't your mom tell you? She
designed this thing with a missile
launcher!

NAME: DORIS
Emmet!

NAME: LUCY
Doris, are you okay back there?

NAME: LUCY
Doris?! Why did she do that?

NAME: VITRUVIUS
The connection between a mother
and son is a powerful thing.

NAME: LUCY
But it's certain death.

NAME: VITRUVIUS
On the contrary. It's connections
like those that give the best
chance to survive...

NAME: DORIS
Get your hands off my flipping
son.

NAME: EMMET
Mom... Wow. Just... wow.

NAME: DORIS
I'm the Chosen One, remember?

NAME: EMMET
I guess that makes two of us.

NAME: DORIS
this time I was trying to keep you
from getting hurt, so I told you
so glad that I get to see the
beautiful waves you finally get to

NAME: EMMET
NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Aw. That's sweet. I want to take
a picture so I can remember you
like this FOREVER!

NAME: EMMET
Lucy? How did you do that?

NAME: LUCY
I used a few connections.

NAME: DORIS
Emmet, now's your chance!

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
Nuh-uh-uh. One step closer, and
bye-bye mommy. Now go away, you
freak, you weirdo, you loser. You
don't belong here. You don't
belong anywhere.

NAME: EMMET
You're right. I don't belong
here...

NAME: EMMET
I belong here!

NAME: THE BLACK FALCON
No!

NAME: EMMET
Rest in pieces.

NAME: DOCTOR
--oy!

NAME: FATHER
Thank God!

NAME: LUCY
What the heck just happened?

NAME: EMMET
Something totally foofy.

NAME: JOKER
--is it just me, or is it getting
crazier out there?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
It's certainly tense. People are
upset, they're struggling. Looking
for work. The garbage strike seems
like it's been going on forever.
These are tough times.
How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
enjoying it?

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
day, so   I really like that. I don't
think I   could ever work in an
office.   Behind a desk.

NAME: JOKER (CONT'D)
No offense.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Have you been keeping up with your
journal?

NAME: JOKER
Everyday.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Great. Did you bring it with you?

NAME: JOKER
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
(impatient; she doesn't
have time for this)
Arthur, last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you. For
these appointments. Do you have it?

NAME: JOKER
Yes ma'am.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Can I see it?

NAME: JOKER
I've been using it as a journal,
but also a joke diary. Funny
thoughts or, or observations-- Did
I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
stand-up comedy?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
No. You didn't.

NAME: JOKER
I think I did.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Oh yeah. Because of what your
mother said,-- about your purpose.
"To bring laughter and joy to the
world," right?

NAME: JOKER
Right.

NAME: JOKER
I didn't realize you wanted to read
it.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
"I just hope my death makes more
sense than my life."

NAME: JOKER
Yeah. I mean, that's just--

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Does my reading it upset you?

NAME: JOKER
No. I just,-- some of it's
personal. You know?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
I understand. I just want to make
sure you're keeping up with it.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
What about your mom? How's she
feeling?

NAME: JOKER
She has good days. But mostly bad.
It's been a big help having me
there. She really needs me.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Seems like she's been sick a lot
since you got home.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
was in the hospital, after my last
episode-- she was having trouble
getting over there to visit.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
All right. So, I'll see you again,
two weeks from today?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Is there something else I can help
you with, Arthur? My next
appointment is waiting.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, I was wondering if you could
ask the doctor to increase the
dosage on my medications? Nothing
seems to make a difference.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Do you know which ones you'd like
increased?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Have you been sleeping?

NAME: JOKER
Some.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Arthur, you're on seven different
medications. Surely they must be
doing something.

NAME: JOKER
I just don't wanna feel so bad
anymore.

NAME: WOMAN ON BUS
(turns back to Joker;
already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my
kid?

NAME: JOKER
I wasn't bothering her, I was--

NAME: WOMAN ON BUS
Just stop.

NAME: WOMAN ON BUS
You think that's funny?

NAME: SOPHIE (OS)
Wait!!

NAME: SOPHIE
Thank you.
Of course it's you,-- everyone else
in this building is just so fucking
rude.

NAME: SOPHIE
How's your mom doing?

NAME: JOKER
It's day to day. I'm doing
everything I can to get her back on
her feet.
Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
her some dinner.

NAME: SOPHIE
She's lucky she has you--

NAME: SOPHIE
Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
many times have I told you that?
This building is so awful, isn't
it?

NAME: SOPHIE
Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
hello.

NAME: JOKER
Hey Sophie--

NAME: JOKER
I'll tell my mom you said hello.

NAME: MOM (OS)
(shattering the moment,
calls out)
Happy?! Did you check the mail
before you came up?

NAME: JOKER
Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.

NAME: MOM (OS)
You sure you looked? Sometimes I
don't know where your head is.

NAME: JOKER
Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
here. I'm gonna make you some
dinner, okay?

NAME: MOM
He must not be getting my letters.

NAME: JOKER
He's a busy man.

NAME: MOM
Too busy for me? I worked for that
family for 12 years. He always had
a smile for me. Least he could do
is write back.

NAME: JOKER
Ma, eat. You need to eat.

NAME: MOM
You need to eat. Look how skinny
you are.

NAME: MOM
All day long it's more bad news.
That's all there is.

NAME: JOKER
Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
television.

NAME: MOM
He's the only hope for Gotham.
He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
says so.

NAME: JOKER
Everybody who? Who do you talk to?

NAME: MOM
Well everybody on the news.

NAME: JOKER
Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
mayor? He can do more good as a
businessman.

NAME: MOM
Because he cares about this city.
And everyone in it-- that's why I
can't believe he hasn't written me
back.

NAME: JOKER
He will. Now eat some dinner.

NAME: JOKER
How you feeling today?

NAME: MOM
I don't know. It always hits me
worse at night, you notice that?

NAME: JOKER
Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
werewolf?

NAME: MOM
It's not funny.

NAME: MOM
Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
A better one. I want you to hand
deliver it to him.

NAME: JOKER
What? Why?

NAME: MOM
Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
them away. We should have tipped
him at Christmas time.

NAME: JOKER
Who tips their mailman?

NAME: MOM
Some people do. Rich people do.

NAME: JOKER
Okay. I can try his office.
Tomorrow.

NAME: MOM
Thank you.
Come sit. It's almost on.

NAME: JOKER
Hello. I have a personal letter for
Mr. Thomas Wayne.

NAME: RECEPTIONIST
Okay. You can leave it with me.

NAME: JOKER
It's kind of important. I need to
make sure he gets it himself.

NAME: RECEPTIONIST
Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
right in.

NAME: RECEPTIONIST
I'm kidding. Leave it here.

NAME: JOKER
Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
work for the Wayne family-- for 12
years. She was their housekeeper.

NAME: RECEPTIONIST
That's great. But you can leave it
with me or you can leave with the
letter. Those are your options. Now
please step aside.

NAME: JOKER
Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
at least call back to him? Tell him
that I'm here.

NAME: RECEPTIONIST
Thomas Wayne is away on business.

NAME: JOKER
Okay. Well, can I have your name?
So I know who I left it with.

NAME: JOKER
Wait. He's right there.
(goes up to the glass,
shouts)
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.

NAME: RECEPTIONIST
Sir. Please stop. Sir!!

NAME: RANDALL (OS)
You okay?

NAME: RANDALL
I heard about the beat down you
took. Fucking savages.

NAME: JOKER
It was just a bunch of kids. I
should have left it alone.

NAME: RANDALL
It's crazy out there. And it's only
getting worse.

NAME: JOKER
My mother says that the people
nowadays lack empathy.

NAME: RANDALL
What's empathy?

NAME: JOKER
It means like "feeling for other
people."

NAME: RANDALL
Like sympathy?

NAME: JOKER
Kind of. But different.

NAME: RANDALL
Take it. I got a few. You gotta
protect yourself out there, buddy.
Too many wackos.

NAME: RANDALL
It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
done if you ever need to use it.
Usually pulling it out is enough.

NAME: JOKER
I, I don't have the money for this,
Randall.

NAME: RANDALL
Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
other time. You're my boy.

NAME: RANDALL
But you didn't get it from me,
okay?

NAME: GARY
Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in
his office.

NAME: JOKER
What for?

NAME: GARY
No clue.

NAME: JOKER
Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
see me?

NAME: HOYT
How's the comedy career? Are you a
famous stand-up yet?

NAME: JOKER
Not quite. Haven't even performed
yet. Just been working my material.
This business is all about fine-
tuning.

NAME: HOYT
Right.

NAME: HOYT
Don't sit. This will be quick.

NAME: HOYT
Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
the guys here, they think you're a
freak. But I like you. I don't even
know why I like you. I mean, you
don't say much.
It's probably that stupid laugh. It
gets me every time. Kills me.

NAME: HOYT
But I got another complaint. And
it's starting to piss me off.

NAME: HOYT
Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
you disappeared. Never even
returned his sign.

NAME: JOKER
No. I got jumped. I told you about
that.

NAME: HOYT
For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
sense, just give him his sign back.
He's going out of business for
god's--

NAME: HOYT
Hey!

NAME: HOYT
What the fuck, Arthur?!

NAME: JOKER
I don't have his sign.

NAME: MOM
--so what did he say when you gave
him the letter?

NAME: JOKER
They wouldn't let me see him.
But they promised me it would get
to him.

NAME: MOM
It's good they promised. He only
works with the best. We should hear
something soon.

NAME: JOKER
Look up.

NAME: JOKER
Why are these letters so important
to you, Ma? What do you think he's
gonna do?

NAME: MOM
He's gonna help us.

NAME: JOKER
Help us how?

NAME: MOM
Get us out of here, take me away
from this place and these-- these
awful people.

NAME: JOKER
You worked for him over 30 years
ago. What makes you think he would
help you?

NAME: MOM
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
If he knew how I was living, if he
saw this place, it would make him
sick. I can't explain it to you any
better than that.

NAME: JOKER
I don't want you worrying about
money. Everyone's been telling me
they think my stand-up is ready for
the big clubs. It's just a matter
of time before I get a break.

NAME: MOM
Happy, what makes you think you
could do that?

NAME: JOKER
What do you mean?

NAME: MOM
I mean, don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

NAME: MOM (OS)
HAPPY!? What was that?

NAME: JOKER
What?!

NAME: MOM
It's so loud.

NAME: JOKER
I know. The Americans are really
giving it to the Japs.

NAME: JOKER
I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.

NAME: JOKER
Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
was loaded? He's my friend. With my
luck, I could have killed someone.
I could have killed myself.

NAME: JOKER
I should have killed myself.

NAME: JOKER
I should kill myself.

NAME: JOKER
Hello. I'd like to open an account.

NAME: SOPHIE
Hey, what are you doing up here?

NAME: JOKER
Oh, hi. That's weird.
(pausing to see if he's
gonna laugh; he's good)
I didn't know you worked at a bank.

NAME: SOPHIE
Pretty glamorous, right?

NAME: JOKER
Very glamorous. Look at this place.

NAME: JOKER
I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
comedy.

NAME: SOPHIE
Really? I had no idea.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah. You know, I'm always making
funny observations. Always on the
look out for my next bit-- so it
makes sense.

NAME: SOPHIE
Right. Anyway, is there something I
could help you with?

NAME: JOKER
I said hi to my mom.

NAME: SOPHIE
Excuse me?

NAME: JOKER
Last week. You said to say hi to my
mom. I did. Made her day.

NAME: BRANCH MANAGER
Everything okay here?

NAME: SOPHIE
Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.

NAME: SOPHIE
(shakes her head; to her
manager)
No. He's not. He's interested in
opening an account.

NAME: BRANCH MANAGER
Great. You just need to fill out a
form. They are back there-- against
the wall.

NAME: JOKER
(covering; trying to act
cool)
Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
as well, Miss.

NAME: JOKER
(shouts out, to no one in
particular)

NAME: JOKER
If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet.

NAME: JOKER
If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet.
If you're happy and you know it and
you really want to show it, if
you're happy and you know it stomp
your feet.

NAME: JOKER
Hoyt, let me explain.

NAME: JOKER
It was, it was a prop gun. It's
part of my act now.

NAME: JOKER
Randall told you that?

NAME: JOKER
Hoyt--

NAME: JOKER
Say what?

NAME: JOKER
--I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

NAME: JOKER
I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

NAME: JOKER SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN,
face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along
with his wig.

NAME: YOUNG WOMAN
No thank you.

NAME: JOKER
(shakes his head, stifling
the laughter)
Please. Don't.

NAME: JOKER
Nothing. I have a condition--

NAME: JOKER
No. It's just my stuff. I don't
have anything.

NAME: JOKER
Hi. Do you like to laugh?

NAME: JOKER
Remember how I told you that I'm a
stand-up comedian?
Hi. How are you?

NAME: JOKER
Hi. Do you like to laugh?

NAME: SOPHIE
What?

NAME: JOKER
(continuing without taking
a breath)
Remember the other day when I told
you about my stand-up comedy. Well,
I'm doing a set next Thursday and
I'm inviting a bunch of my friends
and I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to come and check it out.

NAME: JOKER
Were you crying? Why are you
crying?

NAME: SOPHIE
I had a bad day.

NAME: JOKER
I'm sorry. I, I didn't--

NAME: SOPHIE
It's okay. How would you know.

NAME: JOKER
What happened?

NAME: SOPHIE
I got fired. From the bank.

NAME: JOKER
What for?

NAME: SOPHIE
Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't
fucking matter. I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

NAME: JOKER
Okay. Well, all the info is right
there on the flyer.

NAME: JOKER
You know they say laughter is the
best medicine.

NAME: SOPHIE
Is that what they say?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
We spoke about this last time,
Arthur. You're supposed to bring
your journal with you.

NAME: JOKER
Well I didn't think you were going
to read it.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
You said it didn't bother you.

NAME: JOKER
I lied. Everything bothers me.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
What about it bothered you?

NAME: JOKER
It's personal. It's my private
thoughts. Plus it contains original
comedy material that I don't feel
comfortable handing over to you.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
Arthur, I have some bad news for
you.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
They've cut our funding. We're
closing down our offices next week.

NAME: JOKER
So where will we be meeting?

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
We won't be. The city's cut funding
across the board. Social services
is part of that.

NAME: JOKER
Okay.

NAME: SOCIAL WORKER
They don't give a shit about people
like you, Arthur. You don't have a
voice and they don't really care
what happens to you or to us for
that matter.

NAME: JOKER
How am I gonna get my medication?

NAME: MOM (OS)
Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
is on TV.

NAME: MOM (OS)
Quick! Come.

NAME: MOM
They're interviewing him about
those horrible murders on the
subway last week.

NAME: JOKER
Why are they talking to him?

NAME: MOM
You hear that! I told you. We're
family.

NAME: EMCEE (OS)
This next comic describes himself
as a lifelong Gotham resident who
from a young age was always told
that "his purpose in life was to
bring joy and laughter into this
cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.

NAME: EMCEE (OS)
Please help me welcome Arthur
Fleck!

NAME: JOKER
(trying to stop himself
from laughing)
-- good evening, hello.
(deep breath; trying to
stop laughing)
Good to be here.
I, I hated school as a kid. But my
mother would always say,--
(bad imitation of his mom,
still laughing)
"You should enjoy it. One day
you'll have to work for a living."
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
comedian!"

NAME: JOKER
So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
see much from up there.

NAME: SOPHIE
Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
anything?

NAME: JOKER
All I heard was my heart pounding.

NAME: SOPHIE
It was good. I really needed to get
out of my apartment so, thanks.
What happened to the rest of your
friends?

NAME: JOKER
What friends?

NAME: SOPHIE
Didn't you say some of your friends
were coming?

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
As a performer sometimes you want
to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
People who don't already love me,
or, or have a notion of who I am,
you know?

NAME: SOPHIE
Yeah. I get that.

NAME: SOPHIE (OS)
You believe that shit?

NAME: JOKER
Yeah,-- I don't know how something
like that happens.

NAME: SOPHIE
Please. I'll bet you five bucks
those rich assholes deserved it.

NAME: JOKER
You think?

NAME: SOPHIE
Look at their faces. Those smug
smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
them.

NAME: SOPHIE
The guy who did it is a hero. Three
less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
hoo! Only a million more to go.

NAME: JOKER
Hey. You want to get some coffee?

NAME: SOPHIE
--I'm telling you, it's across the
board. Wall Street, the banks,
politicians. They've been making a
killing for years. Fuck them.

NAME: JOKER
I don't know.

NAME: SOPHIE
What don't you know?

NAME: JOKER
Not all of them are awful. Take
someone like Thomas Wayne for
example. He's a hero.

NAME: SOPHIE
Oh c'mon, he's the worst!

NAME: JOKER
Sophie, he's the only one who can
save this city.

NAME: SOPHIE
You can't be serious!? He's a
complete narcissist. Brags about
his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
us can barely make rent. Or feed
our kids.

NAME: JOKER
What happened?

NAME: SOPHIE
With what?

NAME: JOKER
With your job. At the bank?

NAME: SOPHIE
Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--

NAME: JOKER
We don't have to talk about it.

NAME: SOPHIE
Have you ever been fired before?

NAME: JOKER
Every time.

NAME: SOPHIE
And have you ever wanted to torch
the place?

NAME: JOKER
Every time.

NAME: SOPHIE
Right. And this was like the first
good job I had in like, years. Not
waitressing or anything like that.
It was 9-5. I had benefits. You
know what that means when you have
a kid?

NAME: SOPHIE
But from the very first day, the
manager guy starts smiling at me,
whispering in my ear, touching me,
trying to get me to sleep with him--

NAME: JOKER
Did you do it? Did you go to bed
with him?

NAME: SOPHIE
Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.
So finally I complained to his
boss, and they fired me... And now,
now I don't know what to do with
myself.

NAME: JOKER
Right. Wait, what do you mean?

NAME: SOPHIE
I finally felt good. Like I had a
future. A purpose. And now I don't
even know how I'm gonna pay my
rent.

NAME: JOKER
I'm sorry. I have this thing--

NAME: SOPHIE
I know.

NAME: SOPHIE
How did you get it?

NAME: JOKER
I don't know. I read you can get it
from a brain injury or, or a lesion
in there. My mom said I was born
this way. Born laughing.

NAME: SOPHIE
Is that why she calls you Happy?

NAME: JOKER
Kind of. That actually started when
I was a kid. The other kids made
fun of me, called me Happy-- but
not in a good way. I got so sick of
it, one day when I was about ten,

NAME: SOPHIE
What?

NAME: JOKER
I took a razor and cut this smile
onto my face.
(she's taken aback as he
points to the scars)
Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
how's this for happy?"

NAME: SOPHIE
You okay?

NAME: JOKER
I've been thinking about this night
my whole life.

NAME: JOKER
"That's life."

NAME: MOM
--what, what time is it?

NAME: MOM
What happened? Did you hurt
yourself again?

NAME: JOKER
What is this? How come you never
told me?

NAME: MOM
Is, is that my letter? Is that my
letter, Happy?

NAME: JOKER
How could you not tell me, Ma?

NAME: MOM
You told me you dropped it off.
You have no right opening my mail.
Who do you think you are?

NAME: JOKER
(raising his voice;
excited)

NAME: JOKER (CONT'D)
Apparently I'm Thomas Wayne's son!
How could you keep that from me?

NAME: MOM
Stop yelling at me, you're gonna
kill me, give me a heart attack!

NAME: JOKER
I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited.
How can any of this be real!? How
can Thomas Wayne be my father?

NAME: MOM (OS)
(shouts back from behind
the door)
I'm not talking to you until you
calm down.

NAME: JOKER
(lowers his voice; trying
to sound calm)
Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will
you please talk to me?

NAME: JOKER
Please.

NAME: MOM (OS)
He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
We had a connection. I was so
beautiful then. We were in love.

NAME: MOM (OS)
His wife could see it. She was
jealous from the moment I started
working there. She fired me before
I even knew I was pregnant with
you.

NAME: MOM (OS) (CONT'D)
And, I never told him or anybody
because, well, you can imagine what
people would say about Thomas and
me, and, and what they would say
about you.

NAME: JOKER
(eyes still closed, head
leaning against the door)
What would they say, Ma?

NAME: MOM (OS)
That I was a whore, and Thomas
Wayne was a fornicator, and that
you're a little, unwanted bastard.

NAME: GARY
Hey Art, I heard what happened--
I'm sorry man.

NAME: RANDALL
Yeah, Hoyt did you wrong, buddy.
Doesn't seem fair.

NAME: JOKER
It was a prop gun. And I didn't
pull it out, it fell out.

NAME: MAGICIAN
So is that part of your new act? If
your singing doesn't do the trick,
you just gonna shoot yourself?

NAME: JOKER
Why don't you ask Randall about it?
It was his idea.

NAME: GARY
Since when do you use a prop gun?

NAME: RANDALL
What? I don't. Stop talking outta
your ass, Art!

NAME: RANDALL (CONT'D)
I think all his stupid laughing
musta scrambled his brain or
something.

NAME: RANDALL
Art! Hold up,--

NAME: RANDALL
What the fuck was that about?

NAME: JOKER
What?

NAME: RANDALL
Why would you say that? That, that
it was my idea.

NAME: RANDALL
You don't get it, do you, buddy,
that shit that went down on the
subway, that's no joke. They got
clown sketches on the front of
every fucking paper. It's just a
matter of time before the cops come
around.

NAME: JOKER
I don't know anything about it.

NAME: RANDALL
(leans in close; lowers
his voice)
Art, you know you're my boy. I'm
not gonna say shit. I just hope you
got rid of that gun. That can't
come back on me, okay?

NAME: JOKER
Randall, I didn't shoot anybody.
That wasn't me. And I don't have
time for this, I got somebody real
important I gotta go see.

NAME: RANDALL
You know they're sellin' masks.

NAME: JOKER
What?

NAME: RANDALL
They're selling masks of your clown
face,-- based off the description I
guess. It's like a thing now.

NAME: JOKER
What are you talking about?

NAME: RANDALL
There's a lot of people in this
city who are happy you did what you
did. If you did it.

NAME: JOKER
Randall. Your nose.

NAME: RANDALL
What?

NAME: CLOSE ON NEW "KILLER CLOWN" SKETCH ON FRONT PAGE OF THAT
DAY'S TABLOID, a more detailed drawing.

NAME: ANGLE ON JOKER LOOKING DOWN AT HIS NOTEBOOK, STARING AT A
PHOTOGRAPH OF THOMAS WAYNE RIPPED OUT FROM A MAGAZINE, taped
to a page. He glances at his distorted reflection in the
window, takes his hand and parts his hair to the side, more
like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.

NAME: JOKER IN THE BACK OF A TAXI STARING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE,
at the trees and green grass and blue sky and open spaces
whizzing by. The sun is getting low, bathing everything in a
golden light.

NAME: ALFRED (OS)
(shouting; slight English
accent)
Bruce! What are you doing? Get away
from that man.

NAME: ALFRED
What are you doing? Who are you?

NAME: JOKER
My name's Arthur. I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne--

NAME: ALFRED
You shouldn't be talking to his
son. Why did you give him those
flowers?

NAME: JOKER
I, I was just trying to make him
laugh.

NAME: ALFRED
Well it's not funny. Do I need to
call the police?

NAME: JOKER
No, please. My mother's name is
Penny Fleck. She used to work here,
years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne
that I need to see him?

NAME: ALFRED
(color drains from his
face; beat)
You're her son?

NAME: JOKER
Did you know her?

NAME: JOKER
You don't need to cover for them.
I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset
when she found out.

NAME: ALFRED
There was nothing to find out
about. Your mother was, was
delusional. She was a sick woman.

NAME: JOKER
No. No, just let me speak to Mr.
Wayne.

NAME: ALFRED
Please just go, before you make a
fool of yourself.

NAME: JOKER
Thomas Wayne is my father--

NAME: DET. GARRITY
Mr. Fleck, sorry to bother you, I'm
Detective Garrity, this is my
partner Detective Burke.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
We had a few questions for you, but
you weren't home. So we spoke to
your mother.

NAME: JOKER
You did this to her?

NAME: DET. GARRITY
What? No. We just asked her some
questions and she started getting
hysterical-- hyperventilating,
trouble speaking-- then she
collapsed. Hit her head pretty
hard.

NAME: JOKER
They told me she had a stroke.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
Sorry to hear that.

NAME: DET. BURKE
I'm lost. Is something funny?

NAME: JOKER
(laughter choking up in
his throat)
No I,-- I have a, a--

NAME: DET. BURKE
Okay. But we have some questions
for you.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
About those subway killings from a
few weeks ago.

NAME: JOKER
I don't know anything about that.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
We have an eyewitness who described
a white male, about 6 feet tall, in
clown make up. Or a clown mask.
Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr.
Vaughn, and he said you were on a
job the day of the shooting.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
He also said you got fired that
day,-- For bringing a gun into the
children's hospital.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
You weren't fired?

NAME: JOKER
Not for having a gun. That was prop
gun. Part of my act.

NAME: DET. BURKE
So why were you fired?

NAME: JOKER
They said I wasn't funny.

NAME: JOKER
Now, if you don't mind, I have to
go back and look after my mother.

NAME: DET. BURKE
Hey lemme ask you a question? This
condition of yours,-- Is this real
or is this like some sorta clown
thing?

NAME: JOKER
Clown thing?

NAME: DET. BURKE
I mean, is it part of your act?

NAME: JOKER
What do you think?

NAME: JOKER
Excuse me, I was wondering how I
could check my mother out of here?

NAME: ER NURSE
What's your mother's name?

NAME: JOKER
Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her
home.

NAME: ER RESIDENT
Mr. Fleck, your mother had a
stroke. It's very serious. You
can't "check her out." She's gonna
be here for at least a week.

NAME: JOKER
She's not gonna wanna stay that
long. She doesn't like hospitals.
Or doctors.

NAME: ER RESIDENT
I'm sorry to hear that. But she
can't just leave.

NAME: JOKER
I don't like hospitals either.

NAME: ER RESIDENT
Listen, I wanted to talk you about
something we noticed in her tox
report. We found heavy traces of
multiple medications in her system.

NAME: JOKER
Okay. Thanks.

NAME: ER RESIDENT
One of them's perphenazine. It's a
powerful anti-psychotic. If she was
taking that regularly and then
suddenly stopped, the withdrawal
could have contributed to her
stroke. Did you notice any
symptoms?

NAME: JOKER
Symptoms?

NAME: ER RESIDENT
Withdrawal symptoms. Nausea...
anxiety... hallucinations.

NAME: ER RESIDENT
Do you know how long she's been
taking it?

NAME: JOKER
Can you tell me what those symptoms
are again?

NAME: EXTREME CLOSE ON TV, GRAINY VIDEO OF JOKER'S STAND-UP
PERFORMANCE. Joker on stage smiling behind the microphone,
under the harsh spotlight.

NAME: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
-- I'm sorry to bother you, but can
you settle an argument for us?

NAME: JOKER
Excuse me?

NAME: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
You were the guy on Murray Franklin
last night, right?

NAME: JOKER
No, sorry. Wasn't me.

NAME: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
Except you weren't funny. You
didn't tell any jokes.

NAME: JOKER
I don't know what you're talking
about.

NAME: YOUNG DOCTOR (OS)
No. It was definitely you, buddy.
You're the guy who couldn't stop
laughing. Murray killed you.

NAME: JOKER
If I were you, I'd walk away from
this table before I strangle all
three of you with that fucking
stethoscope hanging from your neck.

NAME: A CROWD OF PROTESTERS SCREAMING AND SHOUTING IN FRONT OF
WAYNE HALL, behind steel barricades. Many wearing Joker's
"clown face" mask... A few wave homemade signs, "CLOWN FOR

NAME: JOKER MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK
WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold-
out black-tie audience--

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
Can I help you, pal?

NAME: JOKER
What? Yeah. No I, I--

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
You need to get in here or
something?

NAME: JOKER
Dad. It's me.

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
Excuse me?

NAME: JOKER
My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
I know you didn't know about me,
and I don't want anything from you.
Well... maybe a hug.

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
Jesus? You're the guy who came by
my house yesterday.

NAME: JOKER
Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
wouldn't let me see you. So I came
here. I have so many questions.

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
Look pal, I'm not your father.
What's wrong with you?

NAME: JOKER
How do you know?

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
Cause you were adopted. And I never
fucked your mother. What do you
want from me, money?

NAME: JOKER
No. What? I wasn't adopted.

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
She never told you? Your mother
adopted you before she even started
working for us. She was arrested
when you were four years old and
committed to Arkham State Hospital.
She's batshit crazy.

NAME: JOKER
No. No, I don't believe that.

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
I don't really give a shit   what you
believe.
But if you ever come to my   house
again, if you ever talk to   my son
again, if I ever even hear   about
you again, I'll--

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
Are you laughing at me?

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
You think this is funny?

NAME: JOKER
(tries shaking his head
no; still laughing and
choking)
No, no I have a con--

NAME: THOMAS WAYNE
(interrupting; raising his
voice)
Is this a fucking joke to you?

NAME: JOKER
Sophie?

NAME: CLERK
Sorry for the wait. All our records
that are 10 years or older are
stored in the basement. You're
talking over 30 years ago,-- I had
to do some serious digging.

NAME: CLERK
Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
still gonna need a release from
her.

NAME: JOKER
Can I ask you a question? How does
someone wind up in here? Have all
these people committed crimes?

NAME: CLERK
Some have. Some are just crazy and
pose a danger to themselves or
others. Some just got nowhere else
to go.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
I don't know what to do, y'know, I
don't think I can take any more of
this.

NAME: CLERK
Yeah, I can't take much more of
this shit either.

NAME: CLERK (CONT'D)
Now they talking about more
layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
do.

NAME: JOKER
Last time I ended up taking it out
on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
thought it would bother me but, it
really hasn't.

NAME: CLERK
What's that?

NAME: JOKER
It's just so hard to try and be
happy all the time, y'know, when
everything's going to shit all
around you.

NAME: CLERK
Listen, I'm just an administrative
assistant, like a clerk. I file
paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
really know what to tell you, but
maybe you should see someone-- they
have programs, like city services.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
just talking to talk.

NAME: CLERK
Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.

NAME: JOKER
(saying it out loud for
himself to hear)
So she was a patient here.

NAME: CLERK
Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin
Stoner... The patient suffers from
delusional psychosis and
narcissistic personality
disorder... Found guilty of
endangering the welfare of a child--

NAME: JOKER
What?

NAME: CLERK
You said she's your mother?

NAME: CLERK
I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
can't release this without the
proper forms. I could get in
trouble.
Besides, it's pretty bad.

NAME: JOKER
I can handle bad. I've been on a
pretty bad run myself.

NAME: CLERK
I can't help you. If you want these
records you have to get your mom to
sign a patient disclosure form. I
can have someone mail you one.

NAME: DR. STONER
We went over this, Penny. You
adopted him. We have all the
paperwork right here.

NAME: DR. STONER
You also stood by as one of your
boyfriends repeatedly abused your
adopted son. And battered you.

NAME: MOM
He didn't do anything to me. Or to
my boy. Can I go now, I don't like
hospitals.

NAME: MOM
That's not true. My apartment
wasn't filthy. I keep a clean
house.

NAME: DR. STONER
And what do you have to say about
your son?

NAME: MOM
I'm just glad I got to know him.

NAME: SOPHIE
What the hell was that? You can't
just walk into my apartment like
that.

NAME: JOKER
No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get
through this, that's why I'm here.

NAME: SOPHIE
What are you talking about? What do
you think this is?

NAME: JOKER
I don't know. I mean I've never
been with a woman "like that," but,
this feels like a beginning to me.

NAME: SOPHIE
Arthur, I was just being nice to
you. I felt sorry for you. I have a
boyfriend.

NAME: JOKER
You what? What? What kind of woman
are you? Who does that?

NAME: SOPHIE
You need to leave. I'm not having
this conversation with you.

NAME: JOKER
Why not?

NAME: SOPHIE
Go back with your friends, honey.
Mommy's having a grown up talk.

NAME: JOKER
No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you
need to hear this. Your mother's a
bad person. She's a whore, she's
seeing two men at once. You can't
trust her,-- She'll break your
fucking heart.

NAME: JOKER
How come nothing ever comes easy
for me?

NAME: JOKER
Who is this?

NAME: JOKER
Yes.

NAME: JOKER
Murray wants me to come on the
show?

NAME: JOKER
Ma, remember how you used to tell
me that God gave me this laugh for
a reason. That I had a purpose. To
bring laughter and joy into this
fucked up world,--

NAME: JOKER
HA! It wasn't God, it was you or,
or one of your boyfriends,-- how
could you let that happen? What
kind of woman are you? What kind of
mother are you?

NAME: JOKER
What's my real name?

NAME: JOKER
C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted.
What's my name? Who am I really?

NAME: MOM
H-h-happ--

NAME: JOKER
(interrupting, snaps at
her)

NAME: JOKER (CONT'D)
Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't
been happy for one minute of my
entire fucking life.

NAME: JOKER
But you know what's funny? You know
what really makes me laugh?

NAME: JOKER
I used to think my life was nothing
but a tragedy, but now, now I
realize it's all just a fucking
comedy.

NAME: JOKER
You wanna hear a joke, Murray?

NAME: JOKER
Knock-knock.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, I don't know if I should
cross or uncross 'em. Both feel
completely unnatural.

NAME: JOKER
Thanks for having me on, Murray. I
can't tell you how much this means
to me, it's been a life long dream.
I have a joke for you--

NAME: JOKER
You're right. You're right,
uncrossed is better.

NAME: JOKER
(wiping his eyes;
restrained anger)
You shouldn't be here. It's not
right.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
We just came to pay our respects.
Sorry about your mother.

NAME: DET. BURKE
Yeah, it's too bad.

NAME: DET. BURKE
Where is everybody?

NAME: JOKER
It's always been just me and her.

NAME: DET. BURKE
We saw you on Murray Franklin.

NAME: JOKER
You saw that?

NAME: DET. GARRITY
Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got
a videotape.

NAME: DET. BURKE
I just couldn't tell if you were
actually trying to be funny or not.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah, well I guess you didn't get
the joke.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
Listen, we need to clear a few
things up, we spoke to the hospital
administrator--

NAME: JOKER
Which hospital?

NAME: DET. BURKE
The Children's Hospital.
The night you were fired. He said
it didn't look like a prop gun, it
was heavy, like a real one. We have
some more questions for you.

NAME: JOKER
I just buried my mother.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
We can do it tomorrow. But you need
to come down to the precinct--
first thing in the morning.

NAME: JOKER
(looks down, reading the
card)
Right. Thanks for coming.

NAME: DET. BURKE
Of course.

NAME: JOKER
That was a joke.

NAME: GARY
Hey Arthur, how's it going? You get
a new gig?

NAME: RANDALL
You must be goin' down to that
rally at City Hall. Right? I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

NAME: JOKER
Is that today?

NAME: RANDALL
Yeah. What's with the clown-face
then?

NAME: JOKER
My mom died.

NAME: RANDALL
Yeah we heard. That's why we're
here. Figured you might wanna go
out, get a drink or something?

NAME: GARY
We don't wanna bother you. Randall
just thought we should come and pay
our respects.

NAME: RANDALL
Yeah, we're family. We gotta stick
together.

NAME: JOKER
It's not a good time. I'm in the
middle of something here.

NAME: GARY
Of course. No problem. Another
time.

NAME: RANDALL
Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,--
one other thing--

NAME: RANDALL
Listen, the cops have been poking
around the shop, they're talking to
all the clowns about those subway
murders and--

NAME: GARY
They didn't talk to me.

NAME: RANDALL
That's because the suspect was a
regular-sized person. If it was a
fucking midget you'd be in jail
right now.
Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking
for me, and, and I just wanna see
what you said. You know, make sure
our stories line up, bein' that
you're my boy and--

NAME: GARY
What the fuck what the fuck WHAT

NAME: JOKER
I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you
believe it?

NAME: JOKER
It's okay, Gary. You can go.

NAME: GARY (OS)
Hey, Art?

NAME: CLOSE ON TAKING RANDALL'S WALLET OUT OF HIS BLOOD SOAKED
PANTS, pocketing all the cash.

NAME: CLOSE ON BUTT OF A GUN STICKING OUT OF RANDALL'S WAISTBAND,
glimpse Joker's hand reaching for it--

NAME: JOKER (OS)
Go on. Go. You're free.

NAME: CLOSE ON THE CAT LOOKING BACK AT JOKER FOR A LONG MOMENT,
before scampering off out into the world, leaving him behind
for good.

NAME: DET. GARRITY
Hey Arthur, where you going?

NAME: DET. BURKE
Yeah, thought you were coming down
to the station this morning.

NAME: BURKE
NAME: GENE UFLAND
--You gotta see this nut for
yourself, Murray. I don't think we
can put him on. With the rioting
out there.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for
this. Cindy's been breaking my
balls all day.

NAME: GENE UFLAND
She's still mad at you about that
thing?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Three marriages, you'd think I'da
fuckin' learned something.
What do I gotta see? I already know
he's a nut. That's why we're
putting him on, it's a goof.

NAME: GENE UFLAND
(just shakes his head, and
smiles)
I'm telling you, you gotta see him,
Murray. I think it's too risky, the
show's too big. It's worth too much
to blow it on this,-- this freak.

NAME: JOKER
(shakes Murray's hand;
effusive)
Murray, I can't believe this is
real, that I'm really here.

NAME: GENE UFLAND
It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some
respect.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Oh shut up, Gene.
Murray is fine. I prefer it in
fact. Thanks for coming on the
show.

NAME: JOKER
Are you kidding? Thank you for the
opportunity. I've been watching you
forever. My mother never missed a
show.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
So what's with the face? Are you
part of the protests?

NAME: JOKER
No, I don't believe in any of that.
I don't believe in anything. I just
thought it would be good for my
act.

NAME: GENE UFLAND
Your act? Didn't you hear that a
kid got killed on the subway and
two cops who were almost beat to
death? You didn't hear about the
dozens of protestors and police
injured in the riots?

NAME: JOKER
No. I hadn't heard.

NAME: GENE UFLAND
--the audience is gonna go crazy if
you put him on. It was okay maybe
for a bit, but not a whole segment.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
It's, it's dangerous. The best
comedy is all those things put
together.
We're gonna go with it.

NAME: JOKER
Thank you Murray.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(flashes his bemused
smile; condescending)
Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
no off-color material, we do a
clean show, okay? You'll be on
after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
and get you. Good?

NAME: JOKER
Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
you bring me out, can you introduce
me as "The Joker"?

NAME: GENE UFLAND
What? You don't want to use your
real name?

NAME: JOKER
Honestly, I don't even know what my
real name is.

NAME: JOKER
Besides, that's what you called me
on the show, Murray. A joker.
Remember?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(to Gene; trying not to
crack up)
Did I?

NAME: GENE UFLAND
I have no idea.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
is.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
You gotta see our next guest for
yourself. Will you stick around?
Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
he could use a doctor.

NAME: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
Oh. Does he have sexual problems?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
He looks like he's got a lot of
problems.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
It's been a crazy few days here in
Gotham, and, I think maybe things
are about to get crazy around here
too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
be right back.

NAME: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
Back in 30 seconds.

NAME: DIRECTOR
Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
it straight out of break.

NAME: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
Five... Four... Three...

NAME: DIRECTOR
Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
O-kay, you may have seen that clip
of our next guest when we first
played it two weeks ago. Now before
he comes out, I just want to say
that we're all heartbroken here and
sensitive to what's going on in the
city tonight. But, this is how he
wanted to come on the show. So let
me introduce-- The Joker.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
show. But I gotta tell ya, with
what happened at City Hall today,
I'm sure many of our viewers here
in the studio, and at home, might
find this look of yours in poor
taste.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Can you tell us why you're dressed
like this?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(can't help but smile at
Joker's laughing)
Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
this is funny. A lot of those
protesters are going with this
look. City seems to be full of
clowns these days.

NAME: JOKER
(just nods, still
laughing)
Yeah. Isn't it great?

NAME: TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
This guy's got nothing.

NAME: DIRECTOR
(hits the producer's talk
button; into the mic)
Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
this?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(smiles; trying to save
the interview)
So when we talked earlier, you
mentioned that you aren't
political. That this look isn't a
political statement.

NAME: JOKER
That's right. I'm not political,
Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
to make people laugh.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
How's that goin' for ya? Have you
been working on any new material?
Do you want to tell us a joke?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
You brought a joke book?

NAME: JOKER
Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
need to read it?

NAME: JOKER
I want to get it right. Knock
knock.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Who's there?

NAME: JOKER
(looks up from his
notebook)
It's the police, ma'am. Your son
has been hit by a drunk driver.
He's dead.

NAME: DIRECTOR
Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
Ready Three. Three.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(bemused smile;
patronizing)
Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
told me backstage that your
mother's a big fan of the show,
that she never misses it.

NAME: JOKER
That's right, Murray. But she's
dead now.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(goes along with the
"joke")
Hold on. Your mother's dead?

NAME: JOKER
Yeah. She is.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Okay. What about your father? Does
he watch the show?

NAME: JOKER
I don't know who my father is,
Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
sexually assaulted by my mother's
boyfriend.

NAME: DR. SALLY FRIEDMAN
Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
about that.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(shakes his head;
irritated)
Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
the kind of humor we do on this
show.

NAME: JOKER
(just keeps going, on a
roll)
Sorry. It's been a rough few
months, Murray. I mean, after my
mother died, the police came to
question me at her funeral. Who
does that?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Oh really? Were you a suspect?

NAME: JOKER
Very funny, Murray. No, they came
because I killed those three Wall
Street guys.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Okay. I'm waiting for the
punchline.

NAME: JOKER
There is no punchline. It's not a
joke.

NAME: DIRECTOR
Did he just confess to killing the
Wall Street Three?

NAME: TECHNICAL DIRECTOR
Yeah. I think he did.

NAME: ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
(turns to the director,
nods)
He definitely did.

NAME: DIRECTOR
Jesus Christ.
(hits the camera talk
button, into mic)
Camera Three, get in close.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
(turns back to Joker; with
gravitas)
You're serious, aren't you? You're
telling us you killed those three
boys on the subway. Why should we
believe you?

NAME: JOKER
I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
is my fate, it was always my fate.
My life is nothing but a comedy.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Okay, I think I understand. You did
it to start a movement, to become a
symbol.

NAME: JOKER
C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
kind of clown who could start a
movement? I killed those guys
because they were awful.
Everybody's awful these days. It's
enough to make anyone crazy.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
So that's it, you're crazy. That's
your defense for killing three
young men? Because they were mean
to you?

NAME: JOKER
No. They couldn't carry a tune to
save their lives.

NAME: JOKER
Why is everyone so upset about
these guys? Because Thomas Wayne
went and cried about them on TV?

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
You have a problem with Thomas
Wayne, too?

NAME: JOKER
Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
easy for him.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
And what's wrong with that?

NAME: JOKER
Have you seen what it's like out
there, Murray? Do you ever actually
leave the studio? Everybody just
yells and screams at each other.
Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
thinks what it's like to be the
other guy. You think men like
Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
think what it's like to be a guy
like me? To be anybody but
themselves.
(shaking his head, voice
rising)
They don't. They think we'll all
just sit there and take it like
good little boys. That we won't
werewolf and go wild. Well, this is
for all of you out there.

NAME: POLICE LIEUTENANT (OS)
That asshole just confessed to
killing those Wall Street guys on
fucking live TV!

NAME: JOKER
You're awful, Murray.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
Me? How am I awful?

NAME: JOKER
Playing my video, inviting me on
the show,-- You just wanted to make
fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh
at Frankenstein on a crowded beach,
isn't it? You're just like the rest
of them, Murray. Everything comes
too easy for you.

NAME: MURRAY FRANKLIN
You don't know the first thing
about me, pal. Look what happened
because of what you did, Arthur,
what it led to. There are riots out
there. Two policemen are in
critical condition, someone was
killed today.

NAME: JOKER
How about another joke, Murray?
What do you get when you cross a
mentally-ill loner with a system
that abandons him and treats him
like trash?

NAME: JOKER
I'll tell you what you get. You get
what you fucking deserve,--

NAME: BACK LIVE IN THE STUDIO, JOKER'S TACKLED BY TWO SECURITY
GUARDS AND SOME STAGEHANDS, still hear screams of terror from
the audience around him.

NAME: STAY ON JOKER'S FACE AS HE HEARS THE POLICE RADIO CRACKLING,
reports of rioters in "Joker" masks setting fires, breaking
windows, looting stores.

NAME: SPARKS FLY UNTIL FINALLY THE UPSIDE DOWN SQUAD CAR COMES TO A
STOP. Smoke rising from the wreck. Ferrante & Teicher's piano
only version of "Send in the Clowns" still playing...

NAME: PUNK
You still think we're all fucking
clowns?

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
What's so funny?

NAME: JOKER
-- just thinking of this joke.

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Do you want to tell it to me?

NAME: JOKER
No.

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Because you don't think I'll get
it?

NAME: JOKER
Because it's personal, it's between
me and him.

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Okay. Is the medication working?
How's your sleeping?

NAME: JOKER
NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
How are you feeling?

NAME: JOKER
Good. Everything's good now.

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Have you been writing in your
journal?

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Great. I want to make sure you're
keeping up with it.

NAME: JOKER
Yeah.

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Have you written about your
episode? About what happened?

NAME: JOKER
How I remember it.

NAME: HOSPITAL DOCTOR
Can I see?

NAME: GARETH
I suppose we could just sack him.

NAME: GARETH
Look, I don't hate the man but ...

NAME: LORD WALTON
I know, Gareth. It's the mental strain he inflicts on us all.
How is Professor Bradbury

NAME: LORD WALTON
Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert?

NAME: HUBERT
Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak,
Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and
running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than ....
useful?

NAME: GUARD
Morning, Bean.

NAME: GARETH
Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks
and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell
him.

NAME: HUBERT
Seconded.     We could all move to France.

NAME: GEORGE
All those in favour.

NAME: LORD WALTON
Come on - settle down everyone.

NAME: VINCENT
I'm sorry I'm late.

NAME: VINCENT
Steady on, old man. I only ...

NAME: GARETH
Not you, you idiot.

NAME: SUIT MAN
Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.
Circa 1670. Can do?

NAME: SUIT MAN
What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art
stored in that one, curious brain of yours.

NAME: GARETH
Then we are agreed, gentlemen.   He goes.

NAME: VINCENT
Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render
Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete.

NAME: HUBERT
There's no question.

NAME: LORD WALTON
Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking
the pills.

NAME: LORD WALTON
Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom,
please.

NAME: LORD WALTON
invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second
one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?

NAME: LORD WALTON
Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you
still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge.
Your invaluable thoughts, sir?

NAME: SIR RUPERT
Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question.

NAME: SUIT MAN
Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius.

NAME: MISS HUTCHINSON
Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom.

NAME: PROGRAMMER
What's happening here?

NAME: BEAN
Ahm...

Ah.... Ahm....

NAME: LORD WALTON
You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the

NAME: LORD WALTON
Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news
which will not, I'm afraid...

NAME: LORD WALTON
Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How?
All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long
will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here
will    you, dear boy.

NAME: LORD WALTON
As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South
California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it

NAME: LORD WALTON
Mr. Bean.     Wonderful news. You are going to America.

NAME: MR. BEAN
Ooooh, how lovely.

NAME: LORD WALTON
Ah, Timothy.    You're sacked.

NAME: GRIERSON
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in
the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.

NAME: BERNIE
Great news.

NAME: 9
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then

NAME: CHECK-IN LADY
Here we go, sir. You've been moved to l st. class. Apparently
your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're
finally on your way.

NAME: GRIERSON
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your
home instead of some expensive hotel.

NAME: BERNIE
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period.

NAME: GRIERSON
David?

NAME: DAVID
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really
like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't
really er ...

NAME: GRIERSON
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate
attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial

NAME: DAVID
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my
family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course
it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?

NAME: GRIERSON
Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that?

NAME: DAVID
No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it.

NAME: DAVID
Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with
Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
more.

NAME: CHARLES
Hello, David.

NAME: DAVID
NAME: ALISON
I had to do some last minute stuff.

NAME: CHARLES
My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you,
gallery going well?

NAME: DAVID
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I
think it ....

NAME: ALISON
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.

NAME: ALISON
Kevin!   You stop that right now!

NAME: CHARLES
Great kids.     Good looking too.

NAME: DAVID
You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,
looks-wise.

NAME: DAVID
Ah ... absolutely.

NAME: ALISON
Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get
into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before
the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.

NAME: ALISON
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin

NAME: DAVID
Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's
coming to work at the Gallery, from England...

NAME: DAVID
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a
while.

NAME: ALISON
There aren't hotels?

NAME: DAVID
Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for
him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all
that stuff.

NAME: DAVID
I said I'd check with you.

NAME: DAVID
Then I said 'yes'.

NAME: ALISON
Do we know anything about him?

NAME: DAVID
Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ...      at least
2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind
dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the
time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here.

NAME: ALISON
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

NAME: DAVID
NAME: ALISON
It's the last thing we need.

NAME: DAVID
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a
sensational idea."

NAME: KEVIN
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....

NAME: DAVID
Great, good.

NAME: DAVID
Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back?     Years ago?
No. Course not. Just imagining it.

NAME: OLD LADY
Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.

NAME: JENNIFER
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are
ugly.

NAME: DAVID
What makes you say that?

NAME: JENNIFER
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan
Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony
Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two
million bucks a year to stay indoors.

NAME: DAVID
Richard Burton was very good-looking.

NAME: JENNIFER
Welsh.

NAME: DAVID
Sean Connery.

NAME: ALISON
Scottish.

NAME: DAVID
Tom Jones?

NAME: JENNIFER
Welsh again.

NAME: DAVID
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.    No-one's
asking you to go to bed with him.

NAME: ALISON
Bed sounds good though.    Bed sounds great.

NAME: KEVIN
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

NAME: DAVID
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

NAME: KEVIN
I vote for Bart.

NAME: JENNIFER
Shut up, Kevin.

NAME: KEVIN
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something
about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad?
Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11
mosquitoes, resting.

NAME: JENNIFER
You know the thing I hate most about children?

NAME: KEVIN
Nope.

NAME: JENNIFER
You.

NAME: COP 1
Police!   Stop or we shoot!

NAME: COP 1
Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers
only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back!

NAME: BRUTUS
Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of medication at all?

NAME: BRUTUS
You could certainly use some.

NAME: ALISON
What did they say?

NAME: DAVID
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...

NAME: ALISON
Did you really ask?

NAME: DAVID
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

NAME: ALISON
What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse
me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and
I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
I'll go.

NAME: ALISON
I said, I'11 go.

NAME: JENNIFER
So. where do your parents live?

NAME: STINGO
My parents are dead.

NAME: JENNIFER
Yeah, so are mine.

NAME: COP 1
Just get him the hell out of here, will ya?

NAME: CAB DRIVER
Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
ya know that?

NAME: ALISON
It isn't working any more, David.

NAME: DAVID
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.
Stupid thing.

NAME: ALISON
No, US.     It's not working any longer -you and me.

NAME: DAVID
Jesus.

NAME: ALISON
I need some time, David. A little time.        It's not just you.
It's partly me.

NAME: JENNIFER
Thanks a lot, Kevin!

NAME: DAVID
That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London
Airport!

NAME: INT. THE LEARY HOUSE. D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
ALISON is still watching T.V. The volume is getting to DAVID.

NAME: DAVID
Alison, please.

NAME: DAVID
I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's
important.

NAME: ALISON
Go ahead.

NAME: DAVID
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

NAME: ALISON
There were three strawberries.

NAME: DAVID
One.

NAME: ALISON
Liar.

NAME: DAVID
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.

NAME: DAVID
Ali?    What's wrong?

NAME: ALISON
Your face smells like a foot.

NAME: ALISON
What is it?    Jennifer!

NAME: DAVID
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...

NAME: JENNIFER
There's a man.    I woke up next to a man ...

NAME: ALISON
NAME: DAVID
It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust
me.

NAME: ALISON
He can't stay here, David.

NAME: DAVID
Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the
gallery ...

NAME: ALISON
David, I'm serious!

NAME: DAVID
I know you are.   Very serious ... most of the time these days.

NAME: ALISON
Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man
in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? (looks at his
tie) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?

NAME: DAVID
Ah, Mr Bean ...

NAME: BEAN
Excuse me.

NAME: BEAN
Now - can I help?

NAME: ANNIE
Two dollars please.

NAME: DAVID
Annie, it's me.

NAME: ANNIE
NAME: DAVID
No, Annie, no.    This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with
us.

NAME: ANNIE
Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but
for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which
is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.

NAME: ANNIE
He doesn't like to say much does he?

NAME: DAVID
Right first time.

NAME: ANNIE
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.

NAME: DAVID
You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes
worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep
aesthetic level.

NAME: OLD LADY 1
What do you think?

NAME: OLD LADY 2
0h yes - lovely - very nice.

NAME: OLD LADY 1
And what colour would you use for the curtains?

NAME: OLD LADY 2
Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a
gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom
would be nice in this yellow ....

NAME: DAVID
Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96.
Know it?

NAME: ANNIE
Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you
upstairs.

NAME: DAVID
Thanks, Annie.

NAME: DAVID
Better go.    Grierson hates people being late.

NAME: BEAN
Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ...

NAME: DAVID
Why me?

NAME: DAVID
Come on!     Let's go!

NAME: GRIERSON
must be our professor from across the sea.

NAME: DAVID
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.

NAME: BEAN
Actually I'm not .... er ...

NAME: GRIERSON
This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.

NAME: THOMAS GRIERSON
Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....

NAME: GRIERSON
Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your
eyes on these.

NAME: GRIERSON
Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check
this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
something?

NAME: DAVID.
They're beautiful, sir.

NAME: GRIERSON
Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to
business.

NAME: GRIERSON
Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery
computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very
exciting stuff ....

NAME: BEAN
Ahm ... NO.

NAME: BERNIE
What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'
interactive public guide to the gallery.

NAME: DAVID
It's very good Bernie.

NAME: BERNIE
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work
oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the
program to every room in the gallery.

NAME: GRIERSON
Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?

NAME: GRIERSON
Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice
President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm,
yes, Doctor?

NAME: BEAN
I'm not actually... um...

NAME: GRIERSON
... Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps
you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.

NAME: BERNIE
Absolutely.     This way, sir.

NAME: GRIERSON
He's a genius, right?

NAME: DAVID
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

NAME: GRIERSON
Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's
job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

NAME: DAVID
Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have
him with us. The whole family's very excited.

NAME: GRIERSON
Glad to hear it.     Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?

NAME: DAVID
You're not going to ....

NAME: GRIERSON
Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not,
repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this
morning?

NAME: DAVID
You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir.

NAME: DAVID
Goodnight Annie.

NAME: ANNIE
Night.

NAME: ROBBER
Gimme the keys!

NAME: ROBBER
I said, give me the keys!

NAME: ROBBER
But I haven't got a f.....

NAME: BEAN
Ssssh!!!!

NAME: ROBBER
I haven't got a gun.

NAME: ROBBER
Okay, okay, I'11 do it!

NAME: COP 1
Excuse me.    Mr. er ... Cabbage?

NAME: BRUTUS
It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.

NAME: BRUTUS
Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got
the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking

NAME: BRUTUS
'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.

NAME: BRUTUS
Mr. Bean.     You lookin' to stay long in California?

NAME: MR. BEAN
Oh, yes.

NAME: DAVID
He was incredible.     This guy is fearless.     He has no fear.

NAME: KEVIN
That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is
brainless he has no brain'.

NAME: DAVID
Well, there is that ...

NAME: BEAN
Ahm....

NAME: KEVIN
It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and
I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.

NAME: KEVIN
Come on, winkle.

NAME: KEVIN
It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the
stupid cuckoo.

NAME: BEAN
Click, click, click, click, click ...

NAME: KEVIN
How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!!

NAME: KEVIN
Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!

NAME: DAVID
Hi,

NAME: ALISON
NAME: DAVID
Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner
that will kill you.

NAME: ALISON
putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?

NAME: DAVID
Sort of half.....

NAME: ALISON
Meaning?

NAME: DAVID
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have
asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

NAME: ALISON
Honestly David, you're so spineless.

NAME: DAVID
Roses.     Wine.

NAME: ALISON
But no real change.

NAME: ALISON
I really do need some time on my own. Away from here.

NAME: DAVID
Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak.
You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.

NAME: ALISON
NAME: DAVID
Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer -
could you turn that damn thing down.

NAME: ALISON
No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ...

NAME: KEVIN
I wish I    could use    that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard
feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used
to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you
around in    a couple    of years, maybe".

NAME: JENNIFER
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.

NAME: DAVID
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?

NAME: JENNIFER
It's you and Mom that need to talk.

NAME: DAVID
Sure.    You're right.

NAME: KEVIN
You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are
you, Dad?

NAME: KEVIN
Are you?

NAME: DAVID
Yes, I am.    I must.

NAME: BEAN
Enter.

NAME: DAVID
Hi, am I disturbing you?

NAME: DAVID
May I?

NAME: DAVID
None of your folks here - Family?

NAME: DAVID
Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've
been here twelve all...

NAME: DAVID
Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do
it) ... to say good night. Okay?

NAME: DAVID
Spineless.

NAME: DAVID
Bean can I ask you something?

NAME: DAVID
Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've
known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?

NAME: DAVID
I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame.
She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the
flesh?

NAME: DAVID
I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but'
let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great
works of art is true, huh?

NAME: DAVID
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody
gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?

NAME: ELMER
Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like
my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with
her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.

NAME: DAVID
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me
David?

NAME: ELMER
Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm
calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're
my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.

NAME: DAVID
You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that
works the night shift.

NAME: DAVID
Stay there.    Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.

NAME: DAVID
Right.   Open now.

NAME: DAVID
I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want
to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave
the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.

NAME: BEAN
What the ... !!!

NAME: ELEVATOR VOICE
Second floor.

NAME: THIN WOMAN
I guess I'll see you up there, guys.

NAME: ELEVATOR VOICE
Third floor.

NAME: BERNIE
I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project
today.

NAME: DAVID
Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy,
you know?

NAME: BERNIE
Howls he getting on with the family?

NAME: DAVID
Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great.

NAME: BERNIE
And howls Alison?

NAME: DAVID
She's ... well, she's good.

NAME: BERNIE
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.
Nice guy. Good looking.

NAME: DAVID
Yes, isn't he.

NAME: DAVID
Isn't it?

NAME: BERNIE
I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even
though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
way, huh?

NAME: DAVID
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -
always a subtle joy.

NAME: BERNIE
Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.

NAME: BERNIE
By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the
balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or
we're all in the
crap house. What     do you think?

NAME: DAVID
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

NAME: BERNIE
comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll
hear soon enough.

NAME: ANNIE
True love can be very hard.

NAME: DAVID
gone?

NAME: BEAN
Ahm.....

NAME: DAVID
What?    What?

NAME: DAVID
Oh Jesus. Oh God.     Oh Jesus God.   Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh
Jesus of Nazareth.

NAME: BEAN
oh dear.

NAME: DAVID
What happened?!!!

NAME: BEAN
Ahm.... (setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive
answer).

NAME: DAVID
NAME: DAVID
Brilliant.   Brilliant. Problem solved!

NAME: GRIERSON
Ah, David.   Showing Dr. Bean our good lady?

NAME: BEAN
Actually I'm not a...

NAME: DAVID
That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his
father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying
doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes.

NAME: GRIERSON
Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself...

NAME: DAVID
No!

NAME: GRIERSON
Er ... pray tell me why?

NAME: ELMER
Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why.

NAME: ELMER
I better continue my rounds, sir..

NAME: DAVID
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very
thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel
the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.

NAME: GRIERSON
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?

NAME: DAVID
Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she,
Bean?

NAME: BEAN
Oh yes.

NAME: DAVID
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of
paints ....

NAME: GRIERSON
Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth

NAME: DAVID
... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In
fact I'll go right now.

NAME: GRIERSON
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've
decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

NAME: GRIERSON
Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current
Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to
inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think
decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you?

NAME: DAVID
Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo.

NAME: DAVID
Bean.   Do you drink?

NAME: DAVID
Neither do I.

NAME: DAVID
It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -
lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?

NAME: DAVID
I guess not.

NAME: DAVID
He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?

NAME: DAVID
... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an
artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a
figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the
problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before
I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.

NAME: DAVID
Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.
Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.
Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I
should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I
tell you something, Beanie ...

NAME: DAVID
Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?

NAME: DAVID
So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you
understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been
better if I'd never been born.

NAME: AND 4 VOLUMES OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA.
Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut.

NAME: DAVID
0 my God. Tell it vas a dream.

NAME: BEAN
Morning.

NAME: DAVID
It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them
Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

NAME: DAVID
What?

NAME: GRIERSON
I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever
looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.

NAME: DAVID
Ahm....

NAME: GRIERSON
Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want
anything to go wrong.

NAME: DAVID
Quite right, sir.

NAME: DAVID
Wait a minute.

NAME: BEAN
Ssshhhh.

NAME: JENNIFER
Bye, Dad.

NAME: DAVID
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen?

NAME: JENNIFER
Be serious, Dad.    It's Saturday.

NAME: DAVID
Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and
with your mom away ... I really need you.

NAME: STINGO
You.

NAME: JENNIFER
Don't worry, Dad.    I'll be home. Monday, after school.

NAME: KEVIN
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna
look just like its handsome driver.

NAME: DAVID
Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this
family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!
Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.

NAME: JENNIFER
And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a
family till you get Mom back.

NAME: JENNIFER
Come on Sting!

NAME: KEVIN
Sting?!   Sounds like something you put on a rash.

NAME: DAVID
Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.

NAME: DAVID
To BEAN )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!
the car!     Both of you. Jesus!

NAME: ANNIE
So, Kevin.    How's it going?

NAME: KEVIN
Badly.    You wanna adopt me?

NAME: ANNIE
Big day today, huh?

NAME: DAVID
Uh ... yes ...

NAME: BERNIE
Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and
concentrating on the future.

NAME: DAVID
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we
haven't been doing as badly as all that.

NAME: DAVID
Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after
Bean.

NAME: KEVIN
My Dad told me all about you.

NAME: ANNIE
Did he now?

NAME: KEVIN
He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain
cell count of about two and a half.

NAME: ANNIE
Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually.

NAME: KEVIN
must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't
do anything.

NAME: GRIERSON
Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David?

NAME: DAVID
Certainly is.

NAME: BERNIE
We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to
every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the
Governor.

NAME: GRIERSON
Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a
winning team.

NAME: KEVIN
This is way cool, Beanie.

NAME: BERNIE
Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who
actually gets things done.

NAME: DAVID
You arrange those flowers yourself?

NAME: ELMER
Sure did.

NAME: DAVID
They're pretty.   Learn it in the army?

NAME: ELMER
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands,
you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

NAME: GRIERSON
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of

NAME: BERNIE
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.

NAME: GRIERSON
Right.    Got it.

NAME: ANNIE
Good day, Governor Reynolds. I'm Annie ...

NAME: BERNIE
Curtsy.

NAME: ANNIE
Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s America.      Women don't
curtsy, they run the damn country!

NAME: GRIERSON
Alex, please!

NAME: ANNIE
That's Annie, sir.

NAME: GRIERSON
This is Elmer, our longest serving...

NAME: BERNIE
Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans'
reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him
of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.

NAME: DAVID
David Leary. I'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and
thank you for your patronage ...

NAME: BERNIE
Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour.       We have
to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!

NAME: GRIERSON
Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a
little smartening up to do myself.

NAME: KEVIN
I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,

NAME: G-O-B-L-I-N
NAME: G-N-O-M-E-S
A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" BEAN tries something 0 else.
The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making
BEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.

NAME: BERNIE
How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?

NAME: BERNIE
We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more.
Period. Oh, And put this on.

NAME: BERNIE
David?   Lift off!

NAME: GRIERSON
what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s
reunion after.

NAME: GRIERSON
Not at all, Governor.    Very striking.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Interesting suit.

NAME: GRIERSON
Why thank you sir.

NAME: REYNOLDS
off the peg?

NAME: GRIERSON
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

NAME: REYNOLDS
Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.

NAME: BERNIE
Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.

NAME: ANNIE
Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller
than you were half an hour ago.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much.

NAME: ANNIE
Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does
she 0 have a decent job?

NAME: REYNOLDS
Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Nice set of medals there Elmer.      Which beach they drop you on?
Utah? Omaha?

NAME: ELMER
Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I
didn't know where I was.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Well, congratulations soldier.

NAME: GRIERSON
Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the
established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?

NAME: REYNOLDS
Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you
got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?

NAME: BERNIE
Everything okay, David?

NAME: DAVID
Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had
got to.

NAME: BERNIE
He's just parking the Governor's car.

NAME: DAVID
Great - keep him out of trouble.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now?      My eyes are making my feet
sore, as my wife would say.

NAME: DAVID
Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way.

NAME: DAVID
Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother
before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.

NAME: DAVID
I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with
his new friend.

NAME: REYNOLDS
Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to
me - or should I say ten million dollars!

NAME: GRIERSON
Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it

NAME: DAVID
Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
England.

NAME: BEAN
Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...

NAME: REYNOLDS
You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten
million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!?

NAME: GRIERSON
Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks

NAME: DAVID
Nice try, kiddo.

NAME: ANNIE
David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife.

NAME: DAVID
Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a
date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.

NAME: ANNIE
She's calling from the hospital ...

NAME: ANNIE
She's on line three!

NAME: ANNIE
Such... great buns.

NAME: REYNOLDS
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more
intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect
your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even
know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who
sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you
guys.

NAME: GRIERSON
I am sorry you feel that way.

NAME: REYNOLDS
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.     That suit stinks and
you obviously dye your hair.

NAME: BERNIE
Certainly, sir.

NAME: BRUTUS
Come on man!     Move it!

NAME: ELMER
Hey, Cop, wanna ride?       Jeese, where do they get you guys?

NAME: BERNIE
There is one other tiny problem, sir.

NAME: KEVIN
Is Jenny gonna be okay?

NAME: DAVID
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

NAME: KEVIN
But is she gonna be okay?

NAME: DAVID
NAME: DAVID
Damn! She's a good kid. Sometimes good people get a break once

NAME: ELMER
It's okay!    I'll tail 'em!

NAME: BRUTUS
You got it.

NAME: DAVID
Just stay away from me!   D'you hear?

NAME: REYNOLDS
Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way
of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass.

NAME: ALISON
They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just
a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while.

NAME: DAVID
Excuse me.

NAME: DOCTOR 1
I'll be back in a minute.

NAME: DAVID
Okay, great.

NAME: ALISON
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.

NAME: DAVID
Ah, well ....

NAME: NURSE
Doctor Jacobson?

NAME: DOCTOR JACOBSON
Yes?

NAME: NURSE
We need you urgently in C Theatre.

NAME: DOCTOR JACOBSON
Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 ....

NAME: NURSE
It is urgent, sir.

NAME: DOCTOR JACOBSON
Okay.....

NAME: ELMER
No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now.

NAME: ELMER
Buck?

NAME: NURSE 2
Doctor ... Bean?

NAME: BEAN
NAME: NURSE 2
Just in time, sir.     Allow me.

NAME: ALISON
When the Police told me what had happened I ... it's stupid I know
... but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to
coma victims ...

NAME: KEVIN
Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee
grinders?

NAME: ALISON
That right.   So I went home and picked it up.

NAME: DAVID
NAME: ASSISTANT
Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the
lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's
severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.

NAME: NURSE 2
He's coming round.

NAME: ASSISTANT
Give him a T 70, straight away.

NAME: ASSISTANT
Shall I do the cut, sir?

NAME: ASSISTANT
I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

NAME: NURSE
I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll
never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
systems.

NAME: ASSISTANT
so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all
better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.

NAME: SIDE-KICK
Any news on the chief?.

NAME: ASSISTANT
There certainly is.    Dr Bean here just saved his life.

NAME: ALISON
0 my god.

NAME: DAVID
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

NAME: ALISON
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

NAME: DAVID
Excuse me.

NAME: DOCTOR 2
Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to
deal with here, sir.

NAME: ALISON
Excuse me, doctor.

NAME: DOCTOR
Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.

NAME: ALISON
Okay.

NAME: DAVID
Say that again, son.

NAME: DOCTOR
I beg your pardon?

NAME: DAVID
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll
make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less
healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.

NAME: DOCTOR
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

NAME: DAVID
We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the
Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end
of the world.

NAME: DAVID
and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going
to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence
and    attention you    are    going to give her case.

NAME: DOCTOR
Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good.

NAME: DAVID
Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will
you?

NAME: ALISON
Smiling         Well, well.

NAME: ALISON
Let's get a coffee.

NAME: DAVID
Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.

NAME: KEVIN
Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna
wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire
bats.

NAME: ALISON
Disgusting.

NAME: DAVID
Everything's gonna be fine.

NAME: ALISON
About Charles...

NAME: DAVID
shhh...

NAME: ALISON
It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was
the last time we laughed? Any of us?

NAME: DAVID
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular
proportions. Olympic standard.

NAME: KEVIN
Dad...

NAME: KEVIN
These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ...

NAME: HOSPITAL PORTER
Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down
the hall that could use ...

NAME: DAVID
NAME: ALISON
in you, my' man?

NAME: ALISON
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.

NAME: DAVID
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

NAME: DAVID
I thought you said....

NAME: DAVID
Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you
hear me? Come on now...

NAME: JENNIFER
Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom?

NAME: KEVIN
I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back
from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do
not lie!

NAME: DAVID
Here, let me do that.

NAME: ALISON
No, I'm fine.

NAME: BEAN
NAME: ALISON
Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready.

NAME: ALISON
There.     Is that how you like them?

NAME: ALISON
He's not too bad.       I can live with him.

NAME: DAVID
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale
to tell. And not a happy one.

NAME: GRIERSON
Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday
teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would
have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent
philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself
for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell
her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership
flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
President.

NAME: GRIERSON
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and
the 21st century.

NAME: BERNIE
Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we
can ...

NAME: GRIERSON
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?
Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we
find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a
criminal of great genius.

NAME: GRIERSON
Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!

NAME: GRIERSON
The best security in the world is no match for a master
criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank
you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new
Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the
computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were
so rudely interrupted by events.

NAME: GRIERSON
David, David, David ...

NAME: DAVID
I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?

NAME: GRIERSON
Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,
relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,
through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I
trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

NAME: GRIERSON
I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie
will.

NAME: GRIERSON
Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation
for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
bathroom.

NAME: GRIERSON
How are you making out there?

NAME: BERNIE
All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be
quite a show.

NAME: BERNIE
Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother.

NAME: BERNIE
Just click on the corner.

NAME: BERNIE
Right let me take over now...

NAME: BERNIE
You've had long enough on it now.       A joke's a joke.   That's it.
Period!

NAME: BERNIE
You can stop right there, Mr! Those are confidential ...

NAME: BEAN
Daaa!   Daaa!

NAME: BERNIE
Excuse me, If I may just ...

NAME: GRIERSON
Shut up, Schimmel. Exactly how long have you been siphoning
gallery money into your own private accounts?

NAME: DAVID
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all
completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...

NAME: BERNIE
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

NAME: GRIERSON
Horse shit.   You're dead, grease-ball.   Period.

NAME: BERNIE
But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn
you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably
typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit
There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me
up!

NAME: GRIERSON
Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that?

NAME: BEAN
NAME: GRIERSON
I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd

NAME: SIDE~KICK
Oh, yeah - I forgot.

NAME: GRIERSON
I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
you do not.

NAME: DAVID
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

NAME: GRIERSON
Of course.

NAME: DAVID
And a car.

NAME: GRIERSON
Mmmmm...

NAME: DAVID
Maybe two cars.

NAME: GRIERSON
A car sounds sensible.

NAME: DAVID
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.
Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
time to make up.

NAME: ALISON
well, it's been... unusual. But thank you.

NAME: JENNIFER
Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time.

NAME: DAVID
Come on          hurry or we'll be late.

NAME: DAVID
... Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National. Said
good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,
huh?

NAME: KEVIN
Good-bye Beanie. It's Bean .... surreal.          And don't forget you're
welcome to come back anytime ...

NAME: KEVIN
... in the distant future.

NAME: DAVID
Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?      I know
it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

NAME: CLEANER
They've moved, guy.

NAME: LORD WALTON
Is he gone?

NAME: MISS HUTCHINSON
Yes, my lord.

NAME: LORD WALTON
Tell the others.

NAME: MISS HUTCHINSON
Very well, my lord.

NAME: MISS HUTCHINSON
He's gone.

<pre>

NAME: VOICE-OVER
A way out west there was a fella,
fella I want to tell you about, fella
by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At
least, that was the handle his lovin'
parents gave him, but he never had
much use for it himself.  This
Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.  But
then, there was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make a whole lot of sense
to me.  And a lot about where he
lived, like- wise.  But then again,
maybe that's why I found the place
s'durned innarestin'.

NAME: VOICE-OVER
They call Los Angeles the City of
Angels.  I didn't find it to be that
exactly, but I'll allow as there are
some nice folks there.  'Course, I
can't say I seen London, and I never
been to France, and I ain't never
seen no queen in her damn undies as
the fella says.  But I'll tell you
what, after seeing Los Angeles and
thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any
a those other places, and in English
too, so I can die with a smile on my
face without feelin' like the good
Lord gypped me.

NAME: VOICE-OVER
Now this story I'm about to unfold
took place back in the early nineties--
just about the time of our conflict
with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I
only mention it 'cause some- times
there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,
'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes
there's a man.

NAME: VOICE-OVER
And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--
sometimes there's a man who, wal,
he's the man for his time'n place,
he fits right in there--and that's
the Dude, in Los Angeles.

NAME: GEORGE BUSH
This aggression will not stand. . .
This will not stand!

NAME: VOICE-OVER
...and even if he's a lazy man, and
the Dude was certainly that--quite
possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
County.

NAME: VOICE-OVER
...which would place him high in the
runnin' for laziest worldwide--but
sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes
there's a man.

NAME: VOICE-OVER
Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.
But--aw hell, I done innerduced him
enough.

NAME: DUDE
It's the LeBaron.

NAME: VOICE
We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny
said you were good for it.

NAME: VOICE
Where's the money, Lebowski!

NAME: VOICE
Where's the money, Lebowski!

NAME: DUDE
It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
Lemme take another look.

NAME: VOICE
Don't fuck with us.  If your wife
owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that
means you owe money to Jackie
Treehorn.

NAME: CHINESE MAN
Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

NAME: DUDE
Oh, man.  Don't do--

NAME: BLOND MAN
You see what happens?  You see what
happens, Lebowski?

NAME: DUDE
Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You
got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,
man.

NAME: BLOND MAN
Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is
Bunny.

NAME: DUDE
Bunny?  Look, moron.

NAME: DUDE
You see a wedding ring?  Does this
place look like I'm fucking married?
All my plants are dead!

NAME: BLOND MAN
The fuck is this?

NAME: DUDE
Obviously you're not a golfer.

NAME: BLOND MAN
Woo?

NAME: WOO
Yeah?

NAME: BLOND MAN
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a
millionaire?

NAME: WOO
Uh?

NAME: WOO
Fuck.

NAME: BLOND MAN
What do you think?

NAME: WOO
He looks like a fuckin' loser.

NAME: DUDE
Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

NAME: WOO
Fuckin' waste of time.

NAME: BLOND MAN
Thanks a lot, asshole.

NAME: MAN
Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

NAME: WALTER
This was a valued rug.

NAME: WALTER
This was, uh--

NAME: DUDE
Yeah man, it really tied the room
together--

NAME: WALTER
This was a valued, uh.

NAME: DONNY
What tied the room together, Dude?

NAME: WALTER
Were you listening to the story,
Donny?

NAME: DONNY
What--

NAME: WALTER
Were you listening to the Dude's
story?

NAME: DONNY
I was bowling--

NAME: WALTER
So you have no frame of reference,
Donny.  You're like a child who
wanders in in the middle of a movie
and wants to know--

NAME: DUDE
What's your point, Walter?

NAME: WALTER
There's no fucking reason--here's my
point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

NAME: DONNY
Yeah Walter, what's your point?

NAME: WALTER
Huh?

NAME: DUDE
What's the point of--we all know who
was at fault, so what the fuck are
you talking about?

NAME: WALTER
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you
talking--I'm not--we're talking about
unchecked aggression here--

NAME: DONNY
What the fuck is he talking about?

NAME: DUDE
My rug.

NAME: WALTER
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of
your element.

NAME: DUDE
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
can't go give him a bill so what the
fuck are you talking about?

NAME: WALTER
What the fuck are you talking about?!
This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm
talking about drawing a line in the
sand, Dude.  Across this line you do
not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is
not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-
American.  Please.

NAME: DUDE
Walter, this is not a guy who built
the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
who peed on my--

NAME: WALTER
What the fuck are you--

NAME: DUDE
Walter, he peed on my rug--

NAME: DONNY
He peed on the Dude's rug--

NAME: WALTER
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This
Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
So who--

NAME: WALTER
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other
Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.
He's gonna be easier to find anyway
than these two, uh. these two  . . .
And he has the wealth, uh, the
resources obviously, and there is no
reason, no FUCKING reason, why his
wife should go out and owe money and
they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

NAME: DUDE
No, but--

NAME: WALTER
Am I wrong!

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, but--

NAME: WALTER
Okay. That, uh.

NAME: DUDE
Fuckin' A.

NAME: DONNY
And this guy peed on it.

NAME: WALTER
Donny!  Please!

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

NAME: DONNY
His name is Lebowski?  That's your
name, Dude!

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should
compensate me for the fucking rug.
I mean his wife goes out and owes
money and they pee on my rug.

NAME: WALTER
Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on
your fucking Rug.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
And this is the study.  You can see
the various commendations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

NAME: DUDE
Yes, uh, very impressive.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Please, feel free to inspect them.

NAME: DUDE
I'm not really, uh.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Please!  Please!

NAME: DUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
That's the key to the city of
Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was
given two years ago in recognition
of his various civic, uh.

NAME: DUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce Business Achiever award,
which is given--not necessarily given
every year!  Given only when there's
a worthy, somebody especially--

NAME: DUDE
Hey, is this him with Nancy?

NAME: YOUNG MAN
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the
first lady, yes, taken when--

NAME: DUDE
Lebowski on the right?

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,
Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

NAME: DUDE
He's handicapped, huh?

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And
this picture was taken when Mrs.
Reagan was first lady of the nation,
yes, yes? Not of California.

NAME: DUDE
Far out.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
And in fact he met privately with
the President, though unfortunately
there wasn't time for a photo
opportunity.

NAME: DUDE
Nancy's pretty good.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Wonderful woman.  We were very--

NAME: DUDE
Are these.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
These are Mr. Lebowski's children,
so to speak--

NAME: DUDE
Different mothers, huh?

NAME: YOUNG MAN
No, they--

NAME: DUDE
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially
pretty cool--

NAME: YOUNG MAN
They're not his, heh-heh, they're
not literally his children; they're
the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
inner-city children of promise but
without the--

NAME: DUDE
I see.

NAME: YOUNG MAN
--without  the means  for higher
education, so Mr. Lebowski  has
committed  to sending  all of them
to college.

NAME: DUDE
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one
more?

NAME: YOUNG MAN
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went
to college?

NAME: DUDE
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most
of my time occupying various, um,
administration buildings--

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Heh-heh--

NAME: DUDE
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into
the ROTC--

NAME: YOUNG MAN
Yes, heh--

NAME: DUDE
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the
truth, Brandt, I don't remember most
of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a
Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very
busy so what can I do for you?

NAME: DUDE
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really
tied the room together-

NAME: LEBOWSKI
You told Brandt on the phone, he
told me.  So where do I fit in?

NAME: DUDE
Well they were looking for you, these
two guys, they were trying to--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
I'll say it again, all right?  You
told Brandt.  He told me.  I know
what happened. Yes?  Yes?

NAME: DUDE
So you know they were trying to piss
on your rug--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Did I urinate on your rug?

NAME: DUDE
You mean, did you personally come
and pee on my--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla
usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

NAME: DUDE
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on
the rug--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I
just want to understand this, sir--
every time a rug is micturated upon
in this fair city, I have to
compensate the--

NAME: DUDE
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam
anybody here, I'm just--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
You're just looking for a handout
like every other--are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: DUDE
Look, let me explain something.
I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr.
Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's
what  you  call me.  That, or Duder.
His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,
you know, you're not into the whole
brevity thing--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Are you employed, sir?

NAME: DUDE
Employed?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
You don't go out and make a living
dressed like that in the middle of a
weekday.

NAME: DUDE
Is this a--what day is this?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
But I do work, so if you don't mind--

NAME: DUDE
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.
This will not stand, ya know, this
will not stand, man.  I mean, if
your wife owes--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
My wife is not the issue here. I
hope that my wife will someday learn
to live on her allowance, which is
ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that
will be her problem, not mine, just
as your rug is your problem, just as
every bum's lot in life is his own
responsibility regardless of whom he
chooses to blame.  I didn't blame
anyone for the loss of my legs, some
chinaman in Korea took them from me
but I went out and achieved anyway.
I can't solve your problems, sir,
only you can.

NAME: DUDE
Ah fuck it.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!
Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your
answer to everything!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Your "revolution" is over, Mr.
Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums
lost!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
...My advice is, do what your parents
did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will
always lose-- do you hear me,
Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

NAME: HALLWAY
--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt
is approaching.

NAME: BRANDT
How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: DUDE
Okay.  The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

NAME: BRANDT
Manolo will load it into your car
for you, uh, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
It's the LeBaron.

NAME: BRANDT
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see
you again some time, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the
neighborhood, need to use the john.

NAME: YOUNG WOMAN
Blow on them.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: YOUNG WOMAN
G'ahead.  Blow.

NAME: DUDE
You want me to blow on your toes?

NAME: YOUNG WOMAN
Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

NAME: DUDE
You sure he won't mind?

NAME: YOUNG WOMAN
Dieter doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

NAME: DUDE
Practicing?

NAME: YOUNG WOMAN
You're not blowing.

NAME: BRANDT
Our guest has to be getting along,
Mrs.  Lebowski.

NAME: DUDE
You're Bunny?

NAME: BUNNY
I'll suck your cock for a thousand
dollars.

NAME: BRANDT
Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very
free-spirited.  We're all very fond
of her.

NAME: BUNNY
Brandt can't watch though.  Or he
has to pay a hundred.

NAME: BRANDT
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

NAME: DUDE
I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

NAME: DONNY
Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in
the water!!

NAME: DUDE
Your maples, Carl.

NAME: WALTER
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it
is no dream.

NAME: DUDE
You're fucking twenty minutes late.
What the fuck is that?

NAME: WALTER
Theodore Herzel.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: WALTER
State of Israel.  If you will it,
Dude, it is no--

NAME: DUDE
What the fuck're you talking about?
The carrier.  What's in the fucking
carrier?

NAME: WALTER
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.
Can't leave him home alone or he
eats the furniture.

NAME: DUDE
What the fuck are you--

NAME: WALTER
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.
I'm looking after it while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

NAME: DUDE
You brought a fucking Pomeranian
bowling?

NAME: WALTER
What do you mean "brought it bowling"?
I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not
buying it a fucking beer.  He's not
gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
me to take care of her fucking dog
while she and her boyfriend went to
Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck
herself.  Why can't she board it?

NAME: WALTER
First of all, Dude, you don't have
an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show
dog with fucking papers.  You can't
board it.  It gets upset, its hair
falls out.

NAME: DUDE
Hey man--

NAME: WALTER
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over
the line!

NAME: WALTER
Smokey Huh?

NAME: WALTER
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.
That's a foul.

NAME: SMOKEY
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

NAME: WALTER
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

NAME: SMOKEY
Bullshit. Walter!

NAME: WALTER
This is not Nam.  This is bowling.
There are rules.

NAME: DUDE
Come on Walter, it's just--it's
Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a
little, it's just a game.

NAME: WALTER
This is a league game.  This
determines who enters the next round-
robin, am I wrong?

NAME: SMOKEY
Yeah, but--

NAME: WALTER
Am I wrong!?

NAME: SMOKEY
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the
marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an
eight.

NAME: WALTER
Smokey my friend, you're entering a
world of pain.

NAME: DUDE
Hey Walter--

NAME: WALTER
Mark that frame an eight, you're
entering a world of pain.

NAME: SMOKEY
I'm not--

NAME: WALTER
A world of pain.

NAME: SMOKEY
Look Dude, I don't hold with this.
This guy is your partner, you should--

NAME: DUDE
Walter, they're calling the cops,
put the piece away.

NAME: SMOKEY
Walter--

NAME: SMOKEY
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking
zero!

NAME: SMOKEY
You happy, you crazy fuck?

NAME: WALTER
This is a league game, Smokey!

NAME: DUDE
Walter, you can't do that.  These
guys're like me, they're pacificists.
Smokey was a conscientious objector.

NAME: WALTER
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with
pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam,
of course--

NAME: DUDE
And you know Smokey has emotional
problems!

NAME: WALTER
You mean--beyond pacifism?

NAME: DUDE
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

NAME: WALTER
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well,
it's water under the bridge.  And we
do enter the next round-robin, am I
wrong?

NAME: DUDE
No, you're not wrong--

NAME: WALTER
Am I wrong!

NAME: DUDE
You're not wrong, Walter, you're
just an asshole.

NAME: WALTER
Okay then.  We play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.  They'll be
pushovers.

NAME: DUDE
Just, just take it easy, Walter.

NAME: WALTER
That's your answer to everything,
Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism
is not--look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq--
pacifism is not something to hide
behind.

NAME: DUDE
Well, just take 't easy, man.

NAME: WALTER
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

NAME: WALTER
Calmer than you are.

NAME: DUDE
Just take it easy, man!

NAME: WALTER
Calmer than you are.

NAME: VOICE
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't
wanna be a hard-on about this, and I
know it wasn't your fault, but I
just thought it was fair to tell you
that Gene and I will be submitting
this to the League and asking them
to set aside the round.  Or maybe
forfeit it to us--

NAME: DUDE
Shit!

NAME: VOICE
--so, like I say, just thought, you
know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

NAME: ANOTHER VOICE
Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,
well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.
Please call us as soon as is
convenient.

NAME: ANOTHER VOICE
Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski
with the Southern Cal Bowling League.
I just got a, an informal report,
uh, that a uh, a member of your team,
uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded
weapon during league play--

NAME: DUDE
Hiya Allan.

NAME: ALLAN
Dude, I finally got the venue I
wanted.  I'm Performing my dance
quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane
Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on
Tuesday night, and I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

NAME: DUDE
Sure Allan, I'll be there.

NAME: ALLAN
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the
tenth.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

NAME: ALLAN
Just, uh, just slip the rent under
my door.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, okay.

NAME: VOICE
--serious infraction, and examine
your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

NAME: VOICE
Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please
do call us when you get in and I'll
send the limo.  Let me assure you--I
hope you're not avoiding this call
because of the rug, which, I assure
you, is not a problem.  We need your
help and, uh--well we would very
much like to see you.  Thank you.
It's Brandt.

NAME: BRANDT
We've had some terrible news.  Mr.
Lebowski is in seclusion in the West
Wing.

NAME: DUDE
Huh.

NAME: BRANDT
Mr. Lebowski.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
It's funny.  I can look back on a
life of achievement, on challenges
met, competitors bested, obstacles
overcome.  I've accomplished more
than most men, and without the use
of my legs.  What. . . What makes a
man, Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: DUDE
Dude.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Huh?

NAME: DUDE
I don't know, sir.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to
do the right thing?  Whatever the
price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

NAME: DUDE
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
You're joking.  But perhaps you're
right.

NAME: DUDE
Mind if I smoke a jay?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Bunny.

NAME: DUDE
'Scuse me?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light
of my life.  Are you surprised at my
tears, sir?

NAME: DUDE
Fuckin' A.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men
also cry.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
I received this fax this morning.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
As you can see, it is a ransom note.
Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable
to achieve on a level field of play.
Men who will not sign their names.
Weaklings.  Bums.

NAME: DUDE
Bummer.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Brandt will fill you in on the
details.

NAME: BRANDT
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as
courier once we get instructions for
the money.

NAME: DUDE
Why me, man?

NAME: BRANDT
He suspects that the culprits might
be the very people who, uh, soiled
your rug, and you're in a unique
position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm
that suspicion.

NAME: DUDE
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,
huh?

NAME: BRANDT
Well Dude, we just don't know.

NAME: DUDE
Fucking Quintana--that creep can
roll, man--

NAME: WALTER
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,
Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: WALTER
The man is a sex offender.  With a
record.  Spent six months in Chino
for exposing himself to an eight-
year-old.

NAME: DUDE
Huh.

NAME: WALTER
When he moved down to Venice he had
to go door-to-door to tell everyone
he's a pederast.

NAME: DONNY
What's a pederast, Walter?

NAME: WALTER
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

NAME: WALTER
Anyway.  How much they offer you?

NAME: DUDE
Twenty grand.  And of course I still
keep the rug.

NAME: WALTER
Just for making the hand-off?

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.

NAME: DUDE
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so
whenever these guys call--

NAME: WALTER
What if it's during a game?

NAME: DUDE
I told him if it was during league
play--

NAME: DONNY
If what's during league play?

NAME: WALTER
Life does not stop and start at your
convenience, you miserable piece of
shit.

NAME: DONNY
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

NAME: DUDE
I figure it's easy money, it's all
pretty harmless.  I mean she probably
kidnapped herself.

NAME: WALTER
Huh?

NAME: DONNY
What do you mean, Dude?

NAME: DUDE
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean
look at it.  Young trophy wife.
Marries a guy for money but figures
he isn't giving her enough.  She
owes money all over town--

NAME: WALTER
That...fucking...bitch!

NAME: DUDE
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin
said, look for the person who will
benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,
you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
to say--

NAME: DONNY
I am the Walrus.

NAME: WALTER
That fucking bitch!

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.

NAME: DONNY
I am the Walrus.

NAME: WALTER
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

NAME: DONNY
What the fuck is he talking about?

NAME: WALTER
That's fucking exactly what happened,
Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

NAME: DONNY
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed
off?

NAME: WALTER
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking
thing-- I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck so that
this fucking strumpet--

NAME: DUDE
I don't see any connection to Vietnam,
Walter.

NAME: WALTER
Well, there isn't a literal
connection, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Walter, face it, there isn't any
connection.  It's your roll.

NAME: WALTER
Have it your way.  The point is--

NAME: DUDE
It's your roll--

NAME: WALTER
The fucking point is--

NAME: DUDE
It's your roll.

NAME: VOICE
Are you ready to be fucked, man?

NAME: QUINTANA
I see you rolled your way into the
semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and
me, we're gonna fuck you up.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah well, that's just, ya know,
like, your opinion, man.

NAME: QUINTANA
Let me tell you something, bendeco.
You pull any your crazy shit with
us, you flash a piece out on the
lanes, I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass and pull
the fucking trigger til it goes
"click".

NAME: DUDE
Jesus.

NAME: QUINTANA
You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with
the Jesus.

NAME: WALTER
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Oh man.

NAME: BRANDT
They called about eighty minutes
ago.  They want you to take the money
and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll
call you on the portable phone with
instructions in about forty minutes.
One person only or I'd go with you.
They were very clear on that: one
person only.  What happened to your
jaw?

NAME: DUDE
Oh, nothin', you know.

NAME: BRANDT
Here's the money, and the phone.
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

NAME: DUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: BRANDT
Her life is in your hands.

NAME: DUDE
Oh, man, don't say that..

NAME: BRANDT
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:
Her life is in your hands.

NAME: DUDE
Shit.

NAME: BRANDT
Her life is in your hands, Dude.
And report back to us as soon as
it's done.

NAME: WALTER
Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

NAME: DUDE
The what?

NAME: WALTER
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have
they called yet?

NAME: DUDE
What the hell is this?

NAME: WALTER
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.
The whites.

NAME: DUDE
Agh--

NAME: DUDE
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies--

NAME: WALTER
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.
The ringer can't look empty.

NAME: DUDE
Walter--what the fuck are you
thinking?

NAME: WALTER
Well you're right, Dude, I got to
thinking.  I got to thinking why
should we settle for a measly fucking
twenty grand--

NAME: DUDE
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you
just wanted to come along--

NAME: WALTER
My point, Dude, is why should we
settle for twenty grand when we can
keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

NAME: DUDE
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a
fucking game, Walter--

NAME: WALTER
It is a fucking game.  You said so
yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

NAME: DUDE '
Yeah, but--

NAME: DUDE
Dude here.

NAME: VOICE
Who is this?

NAME: DUDE
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want
us to go?

NAME: VOICE
...Us?

NAME: VOICE
Shut the fuck up.
Hello?

NAME: DUDE
Yeah?

NAME: VOICE
Okay, listen--

NAME: WALTER
Dude, are you fucking this up?

NAME: VOICE
Who is that?

NAME: DUDE
The driver man, I told you--

NAME: DUDE
Oh shit.  Walter.

NAME: WALTER
What the fuck is going on there?

NAME: DUDE
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it
up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was
in our hands!

NAME: WALTER
Easy, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
We're screwed now!  We don't get
shit and they're gonna kill her!
We're fucked, Walter!

NAME: WALTER
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.
You're being very unDude.  They'll
call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

NAME: WALTER
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here,
Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These
guys are fucking amateurs--

NAME: DUDE
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say
peep when I'm doing business here.

NAME: WALTER
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

NAME: WALTER
But they're amateurs.

NAME: DUDE
Dude here.

NAME: VOICE
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there
is no funny stuff.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.

NAME: VOICE
So no funny stuff.  Okay?

NAME: DUDE
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you
want us to go.

NAME: DUDE
That was the sign.

NAME: WALTER
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back,
nobody's in a position to complain.
And we keep the baksheesh.

NAME: DUDE
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't
told me how we get her back.  Where
is she?

NAME: WALTER
That's the simple part, Dude.  When
we make the handoff, I grab the guy
and beat  it out of him.

NAME: WALTER
...Huh?

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.
That's fucking ingenious, if I
understand it correctly.  That's a
Swiss fucking watch.

NAME: WALTER
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of
this is its simplicity. If the plan
gets too complex something always
goes wrong.  If there's one thing I
learned in Nam--

NAME: DUDE
Dude.

NAME: VOICE
You are approaching a vooden britch.
When you cross it you srow ze bag
from ze left vindow of ze moving
kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch
you.

NAME: WALTER
What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
off?

NAME: DUDE
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!
At a wooden bridge we throw the money
out  of the car!

NAME: WALTER
Huh?

NAME: DUDE
We throw the money out of the moving
car!

NAME: WALTER
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks
up our plan.

NAME: DUDE
Well call them up and explain it to
'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking
simple, I'm sure they'd fucking
understand it!  That's the beauty of
it Walter!

NAME: WALTER
Wooden bridge, huh?

NAME: DUDE
I'm throwing the money, Walter!
We're not fucking around!

NAME: WALTER
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the
ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

NAME: DUDE
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but
sooner or later you're gonna have to
face the fact that you're a goddamn
moron.

NAME: WALTER
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's
the bridge--

NAME: DUDE
Walter!

NAME: WALTER
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

NAME: DUDE
What the fuck?

NAME: WALTER
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch
I roll out!  I double back, grab one
of 'em and beat it out of him!  The
uzi!

NAME: DUDE
Uzi?

NAME: WALTER
You didn't think I was rolling out
of here naked!

NAME: DUDE
Walter, please--

NAME: WALTER
Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's
take that hill!

NAME: DUDE
WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

NAME: WALTER
Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

NAME: WALTER
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used
to say.

NAME: DUDE
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean?  What the fuck're we gonna

NAME: WALTER
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't
see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

NAME: DUDE
Huh?  The problem is--what do you
mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
they're gonna kill that poor woman--

NAME: WALTER
What the fuck're you talking about?
That poor woman--that poor slut--
kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said
so yourself--

NAME: DUDE
No, Walter!  I said I thought she
kidnapped herself!  You're the one
who's so fucking certain--

NAME: WALTER
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

NAME: DONNY
They posted the next round of the
tournament--

NAME: WALTER
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

NAME: DONNY
This Saturday.  Quintana and--

NAME: WALTER
Saturday!  Well they'll have to
reschedule.

NAME: DUDE
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

NAME: WALTER
I told that fuck down at the league
office-- who's in charge of
scheduling?

NAME: DUDE
Walter--

NAME: DONNY
Burkhalter.

NAME: WALTER
I told that kraut a fucking thousand
times I don't roll on shabbas.

NAME: DONNY
It's already posted.

NAME: DUDE
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about
that poor woman?  What do we tell--

NAME: WALTER
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get
sick of her little game and, you
know, wander back--

NAME: DONNY
How come you don't roll on Saturday,
Walter?

NAME: WALTER
I'm shomer shabbas.

NAME: DONNY
What's that, Walter?

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I
tell Lebowski?

NAME: WALTER
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of
rest.  Means I don't work, I don't
drive a car, I don't fucking ride in
a car, I don't handle money, I don't
turn on the oven, and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

NAME: DONNY
Sheesh.

NAME: DUDE
Walter, how--

NAME: WALTER
Shomer shabbas.

NAME: DUDE
That's it.  I'm out of here.

NAME: WALTER
For Christ's sake, Dude.

NAME: DONNY
Oh yeah, how'd it go?

NAME: WALTER
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little
dinged up--

NAME: DUDE
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking
hand- off!  They didn't get, the
fucking money and they're gonna--
they're gonna--

NAME: WALTER
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

NAME: WALTER
Kill that poor woman.

NAME: DONNY
Walter, if you can't ride in a car,
how d'you get around on Shammas--

NAME: WALTER
Really, Dude, you surprise me.
They're not gonna kill shit.  They're
not gonna do shit.  What can they
do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.  Who's
sitting on a million fucking dollars?
Am I wrong?

NAME: DUDE
Walter--

NAME: WALTER
Who's got a fucking million fucking
dollars parked in the trunk of our
car out here?

NAME: DUDE
"Our" car, Walter?

NAME: WALTER
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty
undies.  My fucking whites--Say,
where is  the car?

NAME: DONNY
Who has your undies, Walter?

NAME: WALTER
Where's your car, Dude?

NAME: DUDE
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to
know the answer to everything else!

NAME: WALTER
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped
spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

NAME: DUDE
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking
know it's been stolen!

NAME: WALTER
Well, certainly that's a possibility,
Dude--

NAME: DUDE
Aw, fuck it.

NAME: DONNY
Where you going, Dude?

NAME: DUDE
I'm going home, Donny.

NAME: DONNY
Your phone's ringing, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Thank you, Donny.

NAME: DUDE
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

NAME: YOUNGER COP
Color?

NAME: DUDE
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,
coloration.

NAME: YOUNGER COP
And was there anything of value in
the car?

NAME: DUDE
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple
of Creedence tapes.  And there was
a, uh. . . my briefcase.

NAME: YOUNGER COP
In the briefcase?

NAME: DUDE
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my
papers.  Business papers.

NAME: YOUNGER COP
And what do you do, sir?

NAME: DUDE
I'm unemployed.

NAME: OLDER COP
...Most people, we're working nights,
they offer us coffee.

NAME: DUDE
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But
it's nice when they offer.

NAME: DUDE
...Also, my rug was stolen.

NAME: YOUNGER COP
Your rug was in the car.

NAME: DUDE
No.  Here.

NAME: YOUNGER COP
Separate incidents?

NAME: OLDER COP
Snap out of it, son.

NAME: DUDE
You find them much?  Stolen cars?

NAME: YOUNGER COP
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much
hope for the tape deck though.  Or
the Creedence tapes.

NAME: DUDE
And the, uh, the briefcase?

NAME: FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.
Call when you get home and I'll send
a car for you.  My name is Maude
Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took
the rug.

NAME: OLDER COP
Well, I guess we can close the file
on that one.

NAME: VOICE
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.
Lebowski.

NAME: DUDE
Is that what that's a picture of?

NAME: MAUDE
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.
My art has been commended as being
strongly vaginal.  Which bothers
some men.  The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

NAME: DUDE
Oh yeah?

NAME: MAUDE
Yes, they don't like hearing it and
find it difficult to say.  Whereas
without batting an eye a man will
refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or
his "Johnson".

NAME: DUDE
"Johnson"?

NAME: MAUDE
Thank you.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: MAUDE
Yes, I know about it.  And I know
that you acted as courier.  And let
me tell you something:  the whole
thing stinks to high heaven.

NAME: DUDE
Right, but let me explain something
about that rug--

NAME: MAUDE
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: DUDE
Excuse me?

NAME: MAUDE
Sex.  The physical act of love.
Coitus.  Do you like it?

NAME: DUDE
I was talking about my rug.

NAME: MAUDE
You're not interested in sex?

NAME: DUDE
You mean coitus?

NAME: MAUDE
I like it too.  It's a male myth
about feminists that we hate sex.
It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.
But unfortunately there are some
people--it is called satyriasis in
men, nymphomania in women--who engage
in it compulsively and without joy.

NAME: DUDE
Oh, no.

NAME: MAUDE
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate
souls cannot love in the true sense
of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these.

NAME: DUDE
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho, but I don't
see what it has to do with--do you
have any kalhua?

NAME: MAUDE
Take a look at this, sir.

NAME: DIETER
Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere
iss problem mit deine kable.

NAME: DUDE
Shit, I know that guy.  He's a
nihilist.

NAME: MAUDE
And you recognize her, of course.

NAME: DIETER
Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

NAME: MAUDE
The story is ludicrous.

NAME: DIETER
Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to
verk in zese clozes--

NAME: MAUDE
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes
from here.

NAME: DUDE
He fixes the cable?

NAME: MAUDE
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little
matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career

NAME: DUDE
Shit yeah, the achievers.

NAME: MAUDE
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
yes, and proud we are of all of them.
I asked my father about his withdrawal
of a million dollars from the
Foundation account and he told me
about this "abduction", but I tell
you it is preposterous.  This
compulsive

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, but my-

NAME: MAUDE
I'm getting to your rug. My  father
and I don't get along; he doesn't
approve of my lifestyle and, needless
to say, I don't approve of his.
Still, I hardly wish to make my
father's embezzlement a police matter,
so I'm proposing that you try to
recover the money from the people
you delivered it to.

NAME: DUDE
Well--sure, I could do that--

NAME: MAUDE
If you successfully do so, I will
compensate you to the tune of 1% of
the recovered sum.

NAME: DUDE
A hundred.

NAME: MAUDE
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, but what about--

NAME: MAUDE
--your rug, yes, well with that money
you can buy any number of rugs that
don't have sentimental value for me.
And I am sorry about that crack on
the jaw.

NAME: DUDE
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

NAME: MAUDE
Here's the name and number of a doctor
who will look at it for you.  You
will receive no bill.  He's a good
man, and thorough.

NAME: DUDE
That's really thoughtful but I--

NAME: MAUDE
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a
good man, and thorough.

NAME: DRIVER
--So he says, "My son can't hold a
job, my daughter's married to a
fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on
my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.
But you know me.  I can't complain."

NAME: DUDE
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.
Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya
Tony.

NAME: TONY
Aw, forget about it.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be
worrying about that shit.  Life goes
on!

NAME: TONY
Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your
friend in the Volkswagon?

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: DUDE
When did he-

NAME: SECOND CHAUFFEUR
Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No
arguments.

NAME: DUDE
Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Start talking and talk fast you lousy
bum!

NAME: BRANDT
We've been frantically trying to
reach you, Dude.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

NAME: DUDE
Well we--I don't--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
They did not receive the money, you
nitwit!  They  did not receive the
goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR

NAME: BRANDT
This is our concern, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
No, man, nothing is fucked here--

NAME: DUDE
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?
Those guys are--we dropped off the
damn money--

NAME: DUDE
I--the royal we, you know, the
editorial--I dropped off the money,
exactly as per--Look, I've got certain
information, certain things have
come to light, and uh, has it ever
occurred to you, man, that given the
nature of all this new shit, that,
uh, instead of running around blaming
me, that this whole thing might just
be, not, you know, not just such a
simple, but uh--you know?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
What in God's holy name are you
blathering about?

NAME: DUDE
I'll tell you what I'm blathering
about!  I got information--new shit
has come to light and--shit, man!
She kidnapped herself!

NAME: DUDE
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy
wife, I mean, in the parlance of our
times, owes money all over town,
including to known pornographers--
and that's cool, that's cool-- but
I'm saying, she needs money, and of
course they're gonna say they didn't
get it 'cause she wants more, man,
she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
Sir?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not
occurred to me.

NAME: BRANDT
That had not occurred to us, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Well, okay, you're not privy to all
the new shit, so uh, you know, but
that's what you pay me for.  Speaking
of which, would it be possible for
me to get my twenty grand in cash?
I gotta check this with my accountant
of course, but my concern is that,
you know, it could bump me into a
higher tax--

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Brandt, give him the envelope.

NAME: DUDE
Well, okay, if you've already made
out the check.  Brandt is handing
him a letter-sized envelope which is
distended by something inside.

NAME: BRANDT
We received it this morning.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Since you have failed to achieve,
even in the modest task that was
your charge, since you have stolen
my money, and since you have
unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
I have no choice but to tell these
bums that they should do whatever is
necessary to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And
with Brandt as my witness, tell you
this:  Any further harm visited upon
Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon
your head.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
...By God sir.  I will not abide
another toe.

NAME: WALTER
That wasn't her toe.

NAME: DUDE
Whose toe was it, Walter?

NAME: WALTER
How the fuck should I know?  I do
know that nothing about it indicates--

NAME: DUDE
The nail polish, Walter.

NAME: WALTER
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible
to get some nail polish, apply it to
someone else's toe--

NAME: DUDE
Someone else's--where the fuck are
they gonna--

NAME: WALTER
You want a toe?  I can get you a
toe, believe me.  There are ways,
Dude.  You don't wanna know about
it, believe me.

NAME: DUDE
But Walter--

NAME: WALTER
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this
afternoon--with nail  polish. These
fucking amateurs.   They send us a
toe, we're  supposed to  shit our-
selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My
point is--

NAME: DUDE
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and
then they're gonna kill me--

NAME: WALTER
Well that's just, that's the stress
talking, Dude.  So far we have what
looks to me like a series of
victimless crimes--

NAME: DUDE
What about the toe?

NAME: WAITRESS
Could you please keep your voices
down--this is a family restaurant.

NAME: WALTER
Oh, please dear!  I've got news for
you: the Supreme Court has roundly
rejected prior restraint!

NAME: DUDE
Walter, this isn't a First Amendment
thing.

NAME: WAITRESS
Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

NAME: WALTER
Lady, I got buddies who died face-
down in the muck so you and I could
enjoy this family restaurant!

NAME: DUDE
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry
ma'am.

NAME: WALTER
Don't run away from this, Dude!
Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

NAME: WALTER
Our basic freedoms!

NAME: WALTER
I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

NAME: WALTER
Finishing my coffee.

NAME: POLICEMAN
You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.
Lebowski. Must've been a joyride
situation; they abandoned the car
once they hit the retaining wall.

NAME: POLICEMAN
These were on the road next to the
car.  You'll have to get in on the
other side.

NAME: DUDE
My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

NAME: POLICEMAN
Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.
You're lucky they left the tape deck
though.

NAME: DUDE
My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's
that smell?

NAME: POLICEMAN
Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept
in the car.  Or perhaps just used it
as a toilet, and moved on.

NAME: DUDE
When will you find these guys?  I
mean, do you have any promising leads?

NAME: POLICEMAN
Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with
the boys down at the Crime Lab.
They've assigned four more detectives
to the case, got us working in shifts.

NAME: DONNY
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

NAME: WALTER
Oh for Christ--will you shut the
fuck up, Donny.

NAME: DUDE
I figure my only hope is that the
big Lebowski kills me before the
Germans can cut my dick off.

NAME: WALTER
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No
one is going to cut your dick off.

NAME: DUDE
Thanks Walter.

NAME: WALTER
Not if I have anything to say about
it.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me
a very secure feeling.

NAME: WALTER
Dude--

NAME: DUDE
That makes me feel all warm inside.

NAME: WALTER
Now Dude--

NAME: DUDE
This whole fucking thing--I  could
be sitting here with just pee-stains
on my rug.

NAME: WALTER
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.
Fucking Nazis.

NAME: DONNY
They were Nazis, Dude?

NAME: WALTER
Come on, Donny, they were threatening
castration!

NAME: DONNY
Uh-huh.

NAME: WALTER
Are you gonna split hairs?

NAME: DONNY
No--

NAME: WALTER
Am I wrong?

NAME: DONNY
Well--

NAME: DUDE
They're nihilists.

NAME: WALTER
Huh?

NAME: DUDE
They kept saying they believe in
nothing.

NAME: WALTER
Nihilists!  Jesus.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.

NAME: WALTER
And let's also not forget--let's not
forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent, for uh,
domestic, you know, within the city--
that isn't legal either.

NAME: DUDE
What're you, a fucking park ranger
now?

NAME: WALTER
No, I'm--

NAME: DUDE
Who gives a shit about the fucking
marmot!

NAME: WALTER
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

NAME: DUDE
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need
your sympathy, man, I need my fucking
Johnson!

NAME: DONNY
What do you need that for, Dude?

NAME: WALTER
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go
into the tournament with this negative
attitude--

NAME: DUDE
Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,
Walter!

NAME: WALTER
Fuck the tournament?!

NAME: WALTER
Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want
to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's

No it's fine, really, uh--

NAME: MAUDE
Do you have any news regarding my
father's money?

NAME: DUDE
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta
respecfully, 69 you know, tender my
resignation on that matter, 'cause
it looks like your mother really was
kidnapped after all.

NAME: MAUDE
She most certainly was not!

NAME: DUDE
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen
occasionally?  You might learn
something.  Now I got--

NAME: MAUDE
And please don't call her my mother.

NAME: DUDE
Now I got--

NAME: MAUDE
She is most definitely the perpetrator
and not the victim.

NAME: DUDE
I'm telling you, I got definitive
evidence--

NAME: MAUDE
From who?

NAME: DUDE
The main guy, Dieter--

NAME: MAUDE
Dieter Hauff?

NAME: DUDE
Well--yeah, I guess--

NAME: MAUDE
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

NAME: DUDE
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,
you know him?

NAME: MAUDE
Dieter has been on the fringes of--
well, of everything in L.A., for
about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.
Under 'Autobahn.'

NAME: MAUDE
That was his group--they released
one album in the mid-seventies.

NAME: DUDE
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

NAME: MAUDE
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their
music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

NAME: DUDE
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

NAME: MAUDE
Is he pretending to be the abductor?

NAME: DUDE
Well...yeah--

NAME: MAUDE
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really
kidnap someone that you're acquainted
with.  You can't get away with it if
the hostage knows who you are.

NAME: DUDE
Well yeah...I know that.

NAME: MAUDE
So Dieter has the money?

NAME: DUDE
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a
complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.
Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to
keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands
in old Duder's--

NAME: MAUDE
Do you still have that doctor's
number?

NAME: DUDE
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have
the bruise any more, I--

NAME: MAUDE
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be
responsible for any delayed after-
effects.

NAME: DUDE
Delayed after-eff--

NAME: MAUDE
I want you to see him immediately.

NAME: MAUDE
I'll see if he's available.  He's a
good man, and thorough.

NAME: VOICE
Could you slide your shorts down
please, Mr.  Lebowski?

NAME: DUDE
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

NAME: VOICE
I understand sir.  Could you slide
your shorts down please?

NAME: DUDE
Fuck Me.

Fuckola, man.

Near the In-and-Out Burger--

Uh-huh.

The bulk of the series.

Uh-huh.

Not exactly a lightweight.

No.

And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

NAME: DUDE
Uh.

NAME: WALTER
What have you.  We'll, uh--

NAME: DONNY
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

NAME: WALTER
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh,
brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.
We'll get that fucking money, if he
hasn't spent it already.  Million
fucking clams. And yes, we'll be
near the, uh--some burgers, some
beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking
troubles are over, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already
spent all the money!

NAME: WALTER
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's
still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,
depending on the options.  Wait in
the car, Donny.

Uh-huh.

I just want to say, sir, that we're

Branded, especially the early
episodes, has been a source of, uh,
inspir---

NAME: PILAR
See down, Sweetie.  These are the
policeman--

NAME: WALTER
No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the
impression that we're police exactly.
We're hoping that it will not be
necessary to call the police.

NAME: WALTER
But that is up to little Larry here.
Isn't it, Larry?

NAME: WALTER
Is this your homework, Larry?

NAME: WALTER
Is this your homework, Larry?

NAME: DUDE
Look, man, did you--

Just ask him if he--ask him about
the car, man!

NAME: WALTER
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your
homework, Larry?

NAME: DUDE
Is the car out front yours?

NAME: WALTER
Is this your homework, Larry?

NAME: DUDE
We know it's his fucking homework,
Walter!  Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

NAME: WALTER
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

NAME: DUDE
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

NAME: WALTER
You're going to enter a world of
pain, son.  We know that this is
your homework.  We know you stole a
car--

NAME: DUDE
And the fucking money!

NAME: WALTER
And the fucking money.  And we know
that this is your homework, Larry.

NAME: WALTER
You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

NAME: WALTER
Ah, this is pointless.

NAME: WALTER
All right, Plan B.  You might want
to watch out the front window there,
Larry.

NAME: WALTER
This is what happens when you FUCK a
STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

NAME: WALTER
Fucking language problem, Dude.

NAME: WALTER
Maybe he'll understand this.

NAME: WALTER
Hunh?

NAME: DUDE
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

NAME: DUDE
I accept your apology. . . No I, I
just want to handle it myself from
now on. . . No.  That has nothing to
do with it. . . .Yes, it made it
home, I'm calling from home.  No,
Walter, it didn't look like Larry
was about to crack.

NAME: DUDE
Well that's your perception. . .
Well you're right, Walter, and the
unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND
LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,
I'll be at practice.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

Regrettably, it's true, standards
have fallen in adult entertainment.
It's video, Dude.  Now that we're
competing with the amateurs, we can't
afford to invest that little extra
in story, production value, feeling.

NAME: TREEHORN
People forget that the brain is the
biggest erogenous zone--

NAME: DUDE
On you, maybe.

NAME: TREEHORN
Of course, you do get the good with
the bad.  The new technology permits
us to do exciting things with
interactive erotic software.  Wave
of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

NAME: DUDE
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off
manually.

NAME: TREEHORN
Of course you do.  I can see you're
anxious for me to get to the point.
Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

NAME: DUDE
I thought you might know, man.

NAME: TREEHORN
Me?  How would I know?  The only
reason she ran off was to get away
from her rather sizable debt to me.

NAME: DUDE
But she hasn't run off, she's been--

NAME: TREEHORN
I've heard the kidnapping story, so
save it.  I know you're mixed up in
all this, Dude, and I don't care
what you're trying to take off her
husband.  That's your business.  All
I'm saying is, I want mine.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, well, right man, there are
many facets to this, uh, you know,
many interested parties.  If I can
find your money, man-- what's in it
for the Dude?

NAME: TREEHORN
Of course, there's that to discuss.
Refill?

NAME: DUDE
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

NAME: TREEHORN
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

NAME: DUDE
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way
you do business.  Your money is being
held by a kid named Larry Sellers.
He lives in North Hollywood, on
Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.
A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure
your goons'll be able to get it off
him, mean he's only fifteen and he's
flunking social studies.  So if you'll
just write me a check for my ten per
cent. . . of half a million. . .
fifty grand.

NAME: DUDE
I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you
mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

NAME: TREEHORN
A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your
idea of a joke?

NAME: DUDE
No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's
got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just
wanted a car.  All the Dude ever
wanted. . . was his rug back. . .
not greedy. . . it really.

NAME: THE STRANGER'S VOICE
Darkness warshed over the Dude--
darker'n a black steer's tookus on a
moonless prairie night.  There was
no bottom.

NAME: DUDE
He was innocent.  Not a charge was
true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

NAME: CHIEF
This is your only I.D.?

NAME: DUDE
I know my rights.

NAME: CHIEF
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

NAME: DUDE
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I
want Bill Kunstler.

NAME: CHIEF
What are you, some kind of sad-assed
refugee from the fucking sixties?

NAME: DUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: CHIEF
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to
eject you from his garden party,
that you were drunk and abusive.

NAME: DUDE
That guy treats women like objects,
man.

NAME: CHIEF
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in
this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw
shit.  We got a nice quiet beach
community here, and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.  So let me make
something plain.  I don't like you
sucking around bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
off name, I don't like your jerk-off
face, I don't like your jerk- off
behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
off --do I make myself clear?

NAME: DUDE
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

NAME: DUDE
--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

NAME: CHIEF
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

NAME: CHIEF
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep
your ugly fucking goldbricking ass
out of my beach community!

NAME: DUDE
Jesus, man, can you change the
station?

NAME: DRIVER
Fuck you man!  You don't like my
fucking music, get your own fucking
cab!

NAME: DUDE
I've had a--

NAME: DRIVER
I pull over and kick your ass out,
man!

NAME: DUDE
--had a rough night, and I hate the
fucking Eagles, man--

NAME: DRIVER
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

NAME: DUDE
Jesus.

NAME: MAUDE
Jeffrey.

NAME: DUDE
Maude?

NAME: MAUDE
Love me.

NAME: DUDE
That's my robe.

NAME: MAUDE
Tell me a little about yourself,
Jeffrey.

NAME: DUDE
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

NAME: DUDE
I was, uh, one of the authors of the
Port Huron Statement.--The original
Port Huron Statement.

NAME: MAUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: DUDE
Not the compromised second draft.
And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the
Seattle Seven?

NAME: MAUDE
Mmnun.

NAME: DUDE
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music
business briefly.

NAME: MAUDE
Oh?

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed
of Sound Tour.

NAME: MAUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: DUDE
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you
know, little of this, little of that.
My career's, uh, slowed down a bit
lately.

NAME: MAUDE
What do you do for fun?

NAME: DUDE
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.
Drive around.  The occasional acid
flashback.

NAME: MAUDE
What happened to your house?

NAME: DUDE
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.
Wanted to save the finder's fee.

NAME: MAUDE
Finder's fee?

NAME: DUDE
He thought I had your father's money,
so he got me out of the way while he
looked for it.

NAME: MAUDE
It's not my father's money, it's the
Foundation's.  Why did he think you
had it?  And who does?

NAME: DUDE
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.
Real fucking brat.

NAME: MAUDE
Jeffrey--

NAME: DUDE
It's a complicated case, Maude.
Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately
I've been adhering to a pretty strict,
uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,
you know, limber.  I'm real fucking
close to your father's money, real
fucking close.  It's just--

NAME: MAUDE
I keep telling you, it's the
Foundation's money.  Father doesn't
have any.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

NAME: MAUDE
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

NAME: DUDE
But your father--he runs stuff, he--

NAME: MAUDE
We did let Father run one of the
companies, briefly, but he didn't do
very well at it.

NAME: DUDE
But he's--

NAME: MAUDE
He helps administer the charities
now, and I give him a reasonable
allowance.  He has no money of his
own.  I know how he likes to present
himself; Father's weakness is vanity.
Hence the slut.

NAME: DUDE
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is
that yoga?

NAME: MAUDE
It increases the chances of
conception.

NAME: DUDE
Increases?

NAME: MAUDE
Well yes, what did you think this
was all about?  Fun and games?

NAME: DUDE
Well...no, of course not--

NAME: MAUDE
I want a child.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

NAME: MAUDE
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.
In fact I don't want the father to
be someone I have to see socially,
or who'll have any interest in rearing
the child himself.

NAME: DUDE
Huh...

NAME: DUDE
So...that doctor.

NAME: MAUDE
Exactly.  What happened to your face?
Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

NAME: DUDE
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.
A real reactionary. . . So your
father. . . Oh man, I get it!

NAME: MAUDE
What?

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, my thinking about the case,
man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.
Your father--

NAME: PHONE VOICE
This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in;
leave a message after the beep.

NAME: MAUDE'S VOICE
What're you talking about?

NAME: DUDE
Walter, if you're there, pick up the
fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,
this is an emergency.  I'm not--

NAME: WALTER
Dude?

NAME: DUDE
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I
need you to come pick me up--

NAME: WALTER
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev
shabbas.

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: WALTER
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm
not even supposed to pick up the
phone, unless it's an emergency.

NAME: DUDE
It is a fucking emergency.

NAME: WALTER
I understand.  That's why I picked
up the phone.

NAME: DUDE
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,
just call Donny then, and ask him to--

NAME: WALTER
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

NAME: MAUDE'S VOICE
Jeffrey?

NAME: DUDE
Get out of that fucking car, man!

NAME: DUDE
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,
man!

NAME: MAN
Relax, man!  No physical harm
intended!

NAME: DUDE
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you
been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

NAME: MAN
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

NAME: DUDE
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

NAME: MAN
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking

private snoop!  Like you, man!

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: DA FINO
A dick, man!  And let me tell you
something: I dig your work. Playing
one side against the other--in bed
with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

NAME: DUDE
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay

NAME: DA FINO
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your

She's not my special lady, she's my
fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping
her conceive, man!

NAME: DA FINO
Hey, man, I'm not--

Who're you working for?  Lebowski?
Jackie Treehorn?

NAME: DA FINO

The Gundersons.  It's a wandering
daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.
Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.
Her parents want her back.

NAME: DUDE
Jesus fucking Christ.

NAME: DA FINO

Yeah, it sucks.

NAME: DA FINO
Well maybe you and me could pool our
resources--trade information--
professional courtesy--compeers, you

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.
And stay away from my special la--

Lingenberry pancakes.

NAME: FRANZ
Sree picks in blanket.

NAME: DIETER
Lingenberry pancakes.

NAME: DUDE
I mean we totally fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his pay-off.  And got
the kidnappers all pissed off, and
the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,
but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

NAME: WALTER
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic,
uh.

NAME: DUDE
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
up, then why does he still leave me
in charge of getting back his wife?
Because he fucking doesn't want her
back, man!  He's had enough!  He no
longer digs her!  It's all a show!
But then, why didn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?  I mean, he
knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,
but he never asked for it back.

NAME: WALTER
What's your point, Dude?

NAME: DUDE
His million bucks was never in it,
man!  There was no money in that
briefcase!  He was hoping they'd
kill her!  You throw out a ringer
for a ringer!

NAME: WALTER
Yeah?

NAME: DUDE
Shit yeah!

NAME: WALTER
Okay, but how does all this add up
to an emergency?

NAME: DUDE
Huh?

NAME: WALTER
I'm saying, I see what you're getting
at, Dude, he kept the money, but my
point is, here we are, it's shabbas,
the sabbath, which I'm allowed to
break only if it's a matter of life
and death--

NAME: DUDE
Walter, come off it.  You're not
even fucking Jewish, you're--

NAME: WALTER
What the fuck are you talking about?

NAME: DUDE
You're fucking Polish Catholic--

NAME: WALTER
What the fuck are you talking about?
I converted when I married Cynthia!
Come on, Dude!

NAME: DUDE
Yeah, and you were--

NAME: WALTER
You know this!

NAME: DUDE
And you were divorced five fucking
years ago.

NAME: WALTER
Yeah?  What do you think happens
when you get divorced?  You turn in
your library card?  Get a new driver's
license?  Stop being Jewish?

NAME: DUDE
This driveway.

NAME: WALTER
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

NAME: DUDE
It's just part of your whole sick
Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her
fucking dog.  Going to her fucking
synagogue.  You're living in the
fucking past.

NAME: WALTER
NAME: YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE
Three thousand years of beautiful
tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell
happened?

NAME: WALTER
Jesus Christ.

NAME: BRANDT
He can't see you, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Where'd she been?

NAME: BRANDT
Visiting friends of hers in Palm
Springs.  Just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

NAME: DUDE
But I guess she told Dieter.

NAME: WALTER
Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped
her.

NAME: BRANDT
Who's this gentleman, Dude?

NAME: WALTER
Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

NAME: BRANDT
You shouldn't go in there, Dude!
He's very angry!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

NAME: DUDE
Where's the money, Lebowski?

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Who the hell is he?

NAME: WALTER
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy
who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY

NAME: DUDE
We know the briefcase was empty,
man.  We know you kept the million
bucks yourself.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Well, you have your story, I have
mine.  I say I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

NAME: DUDE
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped
and you could use it as a pretext to
make some money disappear.  All you
needed was a sap to pin it on, and
you'd just met me.  You thought,
hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone
the square community won't give a
shit about.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Well?  Aren't you?

NAME: DUDE
Well. . . yeah.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
All right, get out.  Both of you.

NAME: WALTER
Look at that fucking phony, Dude!
Pretending to be a fucking
millionaire!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
I said out.  Now.

NAME: WALTER
Let me tell you something else.
I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,
and this guy is a fake.  A fucking
goldbricker.

NAME: WALTER
This guy fucking walks.  I've never
been more certain of anything in my
life!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Stay away from me, mister!

NAME: WALTER
Walk, you fucking phony!

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Put me down, you son of a bitch!

NAME: DUDE
Walter!

NAME: WALTER

NAME: WALTER
Oh, shit.

You're bullies!  Cowards, both of
you!

NAME: WALTER
Oh, shit.

NAME: DUDE
He can't walk, Walter!

NAME: WALTER
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
You monsters!

NAME: DUDE
Help me put him back in his chair.

NAME: WALTER
Shit, sorry man.

NAME: LEBOWSKI
Stay away from me!  You bullies!
You and these women!  You won't leave
a man his fucking balls!

NAME: DUDE
Walter, you fuck!

NAME: WALTER
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I
wouldn't've done it if I knew he was
a fucking crybaby.

NAME: DUDE
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

NAME: DUDE
There ya go.  Sorry man.

NAME: WALTER
Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

NAME: WALTER
Sure you'll see some tank battles.
But fighting in desert is very
different from fighting in canopy
jungle.

NAME: DUDE
Uh-huh.

NAME: WALTER
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war
whereas, uh, this thing should be a
fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an
M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking
tank.  Just me and Charlie, man,
eyeball to eyeball.

Yeah.

NAME: WALTER

NAME: DONNELLY
That is for the urn.

NAME: WALTER
Don't need it.  We're scattering the
ashes.

NAME: DONNELLY
Yes, so we were informed.  However,
we must of course transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

NAME: WALTER
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

NAME: DONNELLY
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

NAME: DUDE
Well can we--

NAME: WALTER
A hundred and eighty dollars?!

NAME: DONNELLY
They range up to three thousand.

NAME: WALTER
Yeah, but we're--

NAME: DUDE
Can we just rent it from you?

NAME: DONNELLY
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental
house.

NAME: WALTER
We're scattering the fucking ashes!

NAME: DUDE
Walter--

NAME: DONNELLY
Sir, please lower your voice--

NAME: DUDE
Hey man, don't you have something
else you could put it in?

NAME: DONNELLY
That is our most modestly priced
receptacle.

NAME: WALTER
I'll say a few words.

NAME: WALTER
Donny was a good bowler, and a good
man.  He was. . . He was one of us.
He was a man who loved the outdoors,
and bowling, and as a surfer explored
the beaches of southern California
from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he
was an avid bowler.  And a good
friend.  He died--he died as so many
of his generation, before his time.
In your wisdom you took him, Lord.
As you took so many bright flowering
young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc
and Hill 364.  These young men gave
their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny
who. . . who loved bowling.

NAME: WALTER
And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,
in accordance with what we think
your dying wishes might well have
been, we commit your mortal remains
to the bosom of.

NAME: WALTER
the Pacific Ocean, which you loved
so well.

NAME: WALTER
Goodnight, sweet prince.

NAME: WALTER
Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

NAME: WALTER
Goddamn wind.

NAME: DUDE
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking
asshole!

NAME: WALTER
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

NAME: DUDE
You make everything a fucking
travesty!

NAME: WALTER
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

NAME: DUDE
What about that shit about Vietnam!

NAME: WALTER
Dude, I'm sorry--

NAME: DUDE
What the fuck does Vietnam have to
do with anything!  What the fuck
were you talking about?!

NAME: WALTER
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

NAME: DUDE
You're a fuck, Walter!

NAME: WALTER
Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

NAME: DUDE
Two oat sodas, Gary.

NAME: GARY
Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

NAME: DUDE
Thanks, man.

NAME: GARY
Sorry to hear about Donny.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you
eat the bear, and, uh.

NAME: THE STRANGER
Howdy do, Dude.

NAME: DUDE
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered
if I'd see you again.

NAME: THE STRANGER
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things
been goin'?

NAME: DUDE
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

NAME: THE STRANGER
Sure, I gotcha.

NAME: DUDE
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I
gotta get back.

NAME: THE STRANGER
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know
that you will.

NAME: DUDE
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude
abides.

NAME: THE STRANGER
The Dude abides.

NAME: THE STRANGER
I don't know about you, but I take
comfort in that.  It's good knowin'
he's out there, the Dude, takin' her
easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I
sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp,
that about does her, wraps her all
up.  Things seem to've worked out
pretty good for the Dude'n Walter,
and it was a purt good story, dontcha
think?   Made me laugh to beat the
band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I
didn't like seein' Donny go. But
then, happen to know that there's a
little Lebowski on the way.  I guess
that's the way the whole durned human
comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self,
down through the generations, westward
the wagons, across the sands a time
until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin'
again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed
yourselves.

NAME: THE STRANGER
Catch ya further on down the trail.

NAME: THE STRANGER
...Say friend, ya got any more a
that good sarsaparilla?...

NAME: CORAL
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

NAME: MARLIN
You better believe they did--every single one of them.

NAME: CORAL
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

NAME: MARLIN
So, you do like it, don't you?

NAME: CORAL
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

NAME: MARLIN
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

NAME: CORAL
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, right. Right.

NAME: CORAL
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

NAME: MARLIN
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

NAME: CORAL
I like Nemo.

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

NAME: CORAL
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

NAME: MARLIN
Yeah. What if they don't like me?

NAME: CORAL
Marlin.

NAME: MARLIN
No, really.

NAME: CORAL
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

NAME: CORAL
What?

NAME: MARLIN
You remember how we met?

NAME: CORAL
Well, I try not to.

NAME: MARLIN
Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

NAME: CORAL
Marlin!

NAME: CORAL
Get away!

NAME: MARLIN
Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

NAME: MARLIN
No!

NAME: MARLIN
Coral! Coral?

NAME: MARLIN
Coral? Oh!

NAME: MARLIN
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

NAME: NEMO
First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

NAME: MARLIN
I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

NAME: NEMO
Not you, dad. Me!

NAME: MARLIN
Okay...huh?

NAME: NEMO
Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

NAME: MARLIN
All right, I'm up.

NAME: NEMO
Oh boy--whoa!

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo!

NAME: NEMO
First day of school!

NAME: NEMO
No.

NAME: MARLIN
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

NAME: NEMO
No.

NAME: MARLIN
Are you woozy?

NAME: NEMO
No.

NAME: MARLIN
How many stripes do I have?

NAME: NEMO
I'm fine.

NAME: MARLIN
Answer the stripe question!

NAME: NEMO
Three.

NAME: MARLIN
No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

NAME: NEMO
Lucky.

NAME: MARLIN
Let's see.

NAME: MARLIN
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

NAME: NEMO
Come on, dad. It's time for school.

NAME: MARLIN
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

NAME: NEMO
Ohh...

NAME: MARLIN
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

NAME: NEMO
Yes.

NAME: MARLIN
Brush.

NAME: NEMO
Okay, I'm done.

NAME: MARLIN
You missed a spot.

NAME: NEMO
Where?

NAME: MARLIN
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

NAME: MARLIN
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

NAME: NEMO
It's not safe.

NAME: MARLIN
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

NAME: NEMO
Dad..

NAME: MARLIN
All right. Come on, boy.

NAME: NEMO
Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

NAME: NEMO
Have you ever met a shark?

NAME: MARLIN
No, and I don't plan to.

NAME: NEMO
How old are sea turtles?

NAME: MARLIN
Sea turtles? I don't know.

NAME: NEMO
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

NAME: MARLIN
Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

NAME: NEMO
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

NAME: MARLIN
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

NAME: FISH KIDS
Bye, mom!

NAME: FISH MOM
I'll pick you up after school.

NAME: CRAB KID
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

NAME: MARLIN
Come on, we'll try over there.

NAME: MARLIN
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

NAME: BOB
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

NAME: MARLIN
Yes. Shocking, I know.

NAME: BOB
Marty, right?

NAME: MARLIN
Marlin.

NAME: BOB
Bob.

NAME: TED
Ted.

NAME: BILL
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

NAME: BOB/TED
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

NAME: MARLIN
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

NAME: BILL
Aw, come on, clownie.

NAME: TED
Yeah, do something funny.

NAME: BOB
Yeah!

NAME: MARLIN
All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

NAME: BOB
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

NAME: KIDS
Whoa!

NAME: MR. JOHANSSEN
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

NAME: NEMO
Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

NAME: MARLIN
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

NAME: MARLIN
That's where I would play

NAME: PEARL
What's wrong with his fin?

NAME: TAD
He looks funny!

NAME: SHELDON
Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

NAME: BOB
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

NAME: MARLIN
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

NAME: NEMO
Dad.

NAME: PEARL
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

NAME: TAD
I'm obnoxious.

NAME: KIDS
Mr. Ray!

NAME: SHELDON
Come on, Nemo.

NAME: MARLIN
Whoa, you better stay with me.

NAME: MR. RAY
Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

NAME: NEMO
Dad, you can go now.

NAME: MR. RAY
Well, hello. Who is this?

NAME: NEMO
I'm Nemo.

NAME: MR. RAY
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

NAME: NEMO
Okay.

NAME: MR. RAY
You live in what kind of home?

NAME: NEMO
An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

NAME: MR. RAY
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

NAME: MARLIN
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

NAME: NEMO
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

NAME: MR. RAY
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

NAME: JIMMY
Aw, man!

NAME: MARLIN
Bye, Nemo!

NAME: NEMO
Bye, dad!

NAME: MARLIN
Bye, son! Be safe.

NAME: BOB
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

NAME: MARLIN
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

NAME: BILL
Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

NAME: MARLIN
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

NAME: BOB
Hey, Marty. Calm down.

NAME: MARLIN
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

NAME: BOB
'Pony boy'?

NAME: BILL
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

NAME: TED
Pity.

NAME: NEMO
Whoa.

NAME: TAD
Come on, let's go.

NAME: NEMO
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

NAME: TAD
Cool.

NAME: TAD
Saved your life!

NAME: PEARL
Aw, you guys made me ink.

NAME: NEMO
What's that?

NAME: TAD
I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

NAME: NEMO
Whoa.

NAME: PEARL
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

NAME: SHELDON
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

NAME: PEARL
Okay. Beat that.

NAME: TAD
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

NAME: NEMO
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo, no!

NAME: NEMO
Dad?

NAME: MARLIN
You were about to swim into open water!

NAME: NEMO
No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

NAME: MARLIN
It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

NAME: PEARL
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

NAME: TAD
Yeah, he was too afraid.

NAME: NEMO
No, I wasn't.

NAME: MARLIN
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

NAME: NEMO
I can swim fine, dad, okay?

NAME: MARLIN
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

NAME: NEMO
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

NAME: MARLIN
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

NAME: NEMO
I hate you.

NAME: MR. RAY
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

NAME: MARLIN
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

NAME: MR. RAY
Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

NAME: FISH KID
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

NAME: MARLIN
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--

NAME: NEMO
Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

NAME: MARLIN
I'm coming, Nemo!

NAME: KIDS
Aaaah!

NAME: MR. RAY
Get under me, kids!

NAME: NEMO
Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

NAME: DIVER
Whoa! Hold on.

NAME: MARLIN
Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

NAME: MARLIN
Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

NAME: DORY
Look out!

NAME: MARLIN
Waaaah!

NAME: MARLIN
Ooh, ooh...

NAME: DORY
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

NAME: MARLIN
He's gone, he's gone..

NAME: DORY
There, there. It's all right.

NAME: MARLIN
He's gone.

NAME: DORY
It'll be okay.

NAME: MARLIN
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

NAME: DORY
Hey, I've seen a boat.

NAME: MARLIN
You have?

NAME: DORY
It passed by not too long ago.

NAME: MARLIN
A white one?

NAME: DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

NAME: MARLIN
Where!? Which way!?

NAME: DORY
Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

NAME: DORY
No problem.

NAME: MARLIN
Hey! Wait!

NAME: DORY
Will you quit it?

NAME: MARLIN
What?

NAME: DORY
I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

NAME: MARLIN
Huh?

NAME: DORY
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

NAME: MARLIN
Wait a minute..

NAME: DORY
Stop following me, okay!?

NAME: MARLIN
What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

NAME: DORY
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

NAME: MARLIN
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

NAME: DORY
I did? Oh dear...

NAME: MARLIN
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

NAME: DORY
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

NAME: MARLIN
Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

NAME: DORY
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

NAME: BRUCE
Hello.

NAME: DORY
Well, hi!

NAME: BRUCE
Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

NAME: MARLIN
Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

NAME: BRUCE
Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

NAME: BRUCE
Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

NAME: DORY
Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

NAME: MARLIN
Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

NAME: BRUCE
Oh, come on, I insist.

NAME: MARLIN
O-okay..that's all that matters.

NAME: DORY
Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

NAME: BRUCE
Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

NAME: BRUCE
Anchor! Chum!

NAME: ANCHOR
There you are, Bruce, finally!

NAME: BRUCE
We got company.

NAME: ANCHOR
It's about time, mate.

NAME: CHUM
We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

NAME: ANCHOR
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

NAME: CHUM
Come on, let's get this over with.

NAME: BRUCE
Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

NAME: BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

NAME: ANCHOR
Except stinkin' dolphins.

NAME: CHUM
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

NAME: BRUCE
Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

NAME: ANCHOR
Got mine.

NAME: DORY
Hey there!

NAME: BRUCE
How 'bout you, Chum?

NAME: CHUM
Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.

NAME: BRUCE
That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

NAME: CHUM
Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

NAME: BRUCE
I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

NAME: ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Bruce.

NAME: BRUCE
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

NAME: CHUM
You're an inspiration to all of us.

NAME: ANCHOR
Amen.

NAME: BRUCE
Right, then. Who's next?

NAME: DORY
Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

NAME: BRUCE
Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

NAME: DORY
Woo-hoo!

NAME: BRUCE
Come on up here.

NAME: DORY
Hi. I'm Dory.

NAME: BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Dory.

NAME: DORY
And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

NAME: CHUM
Hey, that's incredible.

NAME: BRUCE
Good on 'ya, mate!

NAME: DORY
Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

NAME: BRUCE
All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

NAME: MARLIN
Me? I don't have a problem.

NAME: BRUCE
Oh. Okay..

NAME: BRUCE/ANCHOR/CHUM
Denial.

NAME: BRUCE
Just start with your name.

NAME: MARLIN
Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

NAME: CHUM
A clownfish? Really?!

NAME: BRUCE
Go on, tell us a joke!

NAME: CHUM
Ooh! I love jokes!

NAME: MARLIN
Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

NAME: NEMO
Daddy!

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo!

NAME: CHUM
Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

NAME: BRUCE
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

NAME: MARLIN
No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

NAME: DORY
Oh my, you poor fish.

NAME: CHUM
Humans. Think they own everything.

NAME: ANCHOR
Probably American.

NAME: BRUCE
Now there is a father looking for his little boy.

NAME: MARLIN
Ugh! What do these markings mean?

NAME: CHUM
Aw, come here.

NAME: ANCHOR
Group hug.

NAME: CHUM
We're all mates here, mate.

NAME: MARLIN
I can't read human.

NAME: DORY
Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!

NAME: MARLIN
No, no, no, Dory!

NAME: DORY
Guys, guys!

NAME: MARLIN
No, Dory!

NAME: DORY
That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

NAME: DORY
Ow, ow, ow.

NAME: MARLIN
I'm so sorry.

NAME: DORY
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

NAME: MARLIN
Ohh...

NAME: DORY
Ow, ow, ow.

NAME: BRUCE
Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.

NAME: ANCHOR/CHUM
Intervention!

NAME: BRUCE
Just a bite!

NAME: ANCHOR
Hold it together, mate!

NAME: CHUM
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

NAME: MARLIN
Dory, look out!

NAME: BRUCE
I'm havin' fish tonight!

NAME: CHUM
Remember the steps, mate!

NAME: BRUCE
Just one bite!

NAME: BRUCE
G'day!

NAME: MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaah!

NAME: BRUCE
Arrrr!

NAME: MARLIN
There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

NAME: DORY
Who is it?

NAME: MARLIN
Dory, help me find a way out!

NAME: DORY
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

NAME: MARLIN
There's gotta be a way out!

NAME: DORY
Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled
just like the word 'escape'.

NAME: MARLIN
Let's go!

NAME: BRUCE
Here's Brucey!

NAME: DORY
I can read? That's right, I can read!

NAME: MARLIN
Well, then here. Read this now!

NAME: ANCHOR
He really doesn't mean it, y'know! He never even knew his father!

NAME: CHUM
Don't fall off the wagon!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh no, it's blocked!

NAME: ANCHOR
No, Bruce. Focus!

NAME: CHUM
Sorry about--this, mate!

NAME: ANCHOR
He's really--a nice guy!

NAME: MARLIN
I need to get that mask!

NAME: DORY
You want that mask? Okay.

NAME: MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no, no!

NAME: MARLIN
Quick grab the mask!

NAME: ANCHOR
Oh no. Bruce?

NAME: DORY
Aw, is the party over?

NAME: PELICAN
Nice.

NAME: NEMO
Dad? Daddy?

NAME: DENTIST
Barbara?

NAME: BARBARA
Uh-huh?

NAME: DENTIST
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

NAME: BARBARA
Okay.

NAME: DENTIST
Hello, little fella!

NAME: NEMO
Aah!

NAME: DENTIST
Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and
I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?

NAME: PATIENT
I think so. We're ready to roll.

NAME: PEACH
He likes bubbles.

NAME: NEMO
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

NAME: JACQUES
Bonjour.

NAME: NEMO
Aah!

NAME: BLOAT
Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

NAME: DEB
Oh, he's scared to death.

NAME: NEMO
I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?

NAME: PEACH
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

NAME: NEMO
Pet store?

NAME: BLOAT
Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

NAME: GURGLE
Pet Palace.

NAME: BUBBLES
Fish-O-Rama.

NAME: DEB
Mail order.

NAME: PEACH
Ebay.

NAME: GURGLE
So which one is it?

NAME: NEMO
I'm from the ocean.

NAME: GURGLE
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

NAME: JACQUES
Oui.

NAME: GURGLE
Clean him!

NAME: JACQUES
Oui.

NAME: GURGLE
Ocean!

NAME: JACQUES
Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean.

NAME: BUBBLES
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

NAME: NEMO
Big...and blue?

NAME: BUBBLES
I knew it.

NAME: DEB
Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not
around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything
my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!

NAME: BLOAT
Can't hear you, Peach.

NAME: PEACH
I said we got a live one.

NAME: GURGLE
Yes!

NAME: BLOAT
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

NAME: DEB
What do we got?

NAME: PEACH
Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.

NAME: PATIENT
Owwwwwwwww!

NAME: BLOAT
Rubber dam and clamp installed?

NAME: PEACH
Yep.

NAME: GURGLE
What did he use to open?

NAME: PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

NAME: DEB
I can't see, Flo.

NAME: PATIENT
You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!

NAME: PEACH
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

NAME: BLOAT
Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

NAME: GURGLE
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

NAME: BLOAT
It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

NAME: GURGLE
No, no. K-Flex.

NAME: BLOAT
Hedstrom!

NAME: GURGLE
K-Flex!

NAME: DEB
I'll go deflate him.

NAME: DENTIST
All right, go ahead and rinse.

NAME: GURGLE
Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.

NAME: PEACH
Hey, Nigel.

NAME: NIGEL
What did I miss? Am I late?

NAME: PEACH
Root canal and it's a doozy.

NAME: NIGEL
Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?

NAME: PEACH
Gator-Glidden drill.

NAME: NIGEL
He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus...
hello.

NAME: NIGEL
Who's this?

NAME: DEB
New guy. Ha ha ha!

NAME: GURGLE
The dentist took him off the reef.

NAME: DENTIST
Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh,
the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week.
Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're
her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up
I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby.

NAME: BLOAT
Oh, Darla.

She's a fish killer.

NAME: NEMO
I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!

NAME: GURGLE
Oh, he's stuck!

NAME: NEMO
Can you help me?

NAME: GILL
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

NAME: PEACH
Gill..

NAME: GILL
I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

NAME: NEMO
I can't. I have a bad fin.

NAME: GILL
Never stopped me.

NAME: GILL
Just think about what you need to do.

NAME: BLOAT
Come on.

NAME: GILL
Perfect.

NAME: BUBBLES
Yay!

NAME: GURGLE
You did it!

NAME: DEB
Good squirming! Ha ha ha!

NAME: PEACH
Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

NAME: GILL
Yeah.

NAME: PEACH
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

NAME: GILL
I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

NAME: BLOAT
So kid, you got a name or what?

Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...

It's gone. I've lost the mask.

NAME: DORY
Did you drop it?

NAME: MARLIN
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.

NAME: DORY
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?

NAME: MARLIN
I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory, no singing.

NAME: MARLIN
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!

NAME: DORY
Sorry.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory, do you see anything?

NAME: DORY
Aaah! Something's got me!

NAME: MARLIN
That was me. I'm sorry.

NAME: MARLIN
Who could it be? It's me!

NAME: DORY
Are..are you my conscience?

NAME: MARLIN
Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

NAME: DORY
Hmm, can't complain.

NAME: MARLIN
Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?

NAME: DORY
I see..I see a light.

NAME: MARLIN
A light.

NAME: DORY
Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?

NAME: MARLIN
No, I see it too. What is it?

NAME: DORY
It's so pretty.

NAME: MARLIN
I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.

NAME: DORY
I want to touch it. Oh!

NAME: MARLIN
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

NAME: MARLIN
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.

I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

NAME: DORY
Haah!

NAME: MARLIN
The mask!

NAME: DORY
What mask?

NAME: DORY
Okay, I can't see a thing.

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, gee!

NAME: DORY
Hey, look! A mask!

NAME: MARLIN
Read it!

NAME: DORY
I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That's great, keep it right there.

NAME: MARLIN
Just read it!

NAME: DORY
Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh!
The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

NAME: MARLIN
P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!

NAME: DORY
Okay, second line. '42'.

NAME: MARLIN
Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

NAME: DORY
Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'...

NAME: MARLIN
Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

NAME: DORY
The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!

NAME: MARLIN
That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure!
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!

NAME: DORY
'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!

NAME: MARLIN
Duck!

NAME: DORY
Aaah!

NAME: MARLIN
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! What did the mask say?

NAME: MARLIN
Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?

NAME: DORY
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!

NAME: MARLIN/DORY
Aaah!

NAME: DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

NAME: JACQUES
Psst. Nemo.

NAME: NEMO
Mmmm...

NAME: JACQUES
Nemo.

NAME: NEMO
Huh?

NAME: JACQUES
Suivez-moi. Follow me.

NAME: GILL
State your name.

NAME: NEMO
Nemo.

NAME: GILL
Brother Bloat, proceed.

NAME: BLOAT
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

NAME: NEMO
Huh?

NAME: PEACH
We want you in our club, kid.

NAME: NEMO
Really?

NAME: BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!

NAME: PEACH
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!

NAME: GILL
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

NAME: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

NAME: GILL
Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

NAME: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

NAME: GILL
Enough with the Sharkbait.

NAME: GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.

NAME: GILL
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

NAME: BLOAT/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Agreed!

NAME: GILL
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.

NAME: NEMO
Escape? Really?

NAME: GILL
We're all gonna escape!

NAME: GURGLE
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

NAME: DEB
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.

NAME: BLOAT
Yeah. Why should this be any different?

NAME: GILL
'Cause we've got him.

NAME: NEMO
Me?

NAME: GILL
You see that filter?

NAME: NEMO
Yeah?

NAME: GILL
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?

NAME: BLOAT
Aye!

NAME: JACQUES
Aye!

NAME: DEB
Aye!

NAME: BUBBLES
Aye!

NAME: GURGLE
I think your nuts.

NAME: GURGLE
No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.

NAME: GILL
He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?

NAME: NEMO
Let's do it.

NAME: DORY
I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P.
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's
where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...

NAME: DORY
P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell
you again. I don't get tired of it--

NAME: MARLIN
Okay, all right.

NAME: DORY
Huh?

NAME: MARLIN
Here's the thing.

NAME: MARLIN
Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself.

NAME: DORY
Okay.

NAME: MARLIN
Y'know, alone.

NAME: DORY
Uh-huh.

NAME: MARLIN
Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you...
with me.

NAME: DORY
Huh?

NAME: MARLIN
I don't wanna hurt your feelings..

NAME: DORY
You want me to leave?

NAME: MARLIN
Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays
and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's
a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.

NAME: MARLIN
No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?

NAME: DORY
Um, I don't remember. Were you?

NAME: MARLIN
No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?

NAME: DORY
Mm-mmm-mmmm.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.

NAME: DORY
Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

NAME: DORY
Wait, wait, um..

NAME: MARLIN
It's a swordfish.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?

NAME: DORY
Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Saw that.

NAME: MARLIN
What?

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.

NAME: DORY
Clam!

NAME: DORY
Oh, they're good.

NAME: MARLIN
Will somebody please give me directions?

NAME: DORY
Ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: MARLIN
I'm serious.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!

NAME: MARLIN
Thank you.

NAME: DORY
Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?

NAME: MARLIN
What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from
home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

NAME: DORY
Boy, bet that's frustrating.

NAME: MARLIN
Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.

NAME: DORY
You're son Chico?

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo.

NAME: DORY
Right. Got it.

NAME: MARLIN
But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.

NAME: DORY
Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
What, is he bothering you again?

NAME: DORY
No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

NAME: MOONFISH TED
Sure do.

NAME: DORY
Oh, hey! They know Sydney!

NAME: DORY
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current,
can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I
don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna
put you right past Sydney.

NAME: MARLIN
Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!

NAME: DORY
Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.

NAME: MARLIN
Well, listen fellas, thank you.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?

NAME: DORY
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.

NAME: DORY
Yes.

NAME: MOONFISH LEADER
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

NAME: DORY
Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner.
Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello!
Okay, let's go.

NAME: MARLIN
Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.

NAME: DORY
Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through
it, not over it.

NAME: MARLIN
Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.

NAME: DORY
I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.

NAME: MARLIN
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

NAME: DORY
Come on, trust me on this.

NAME: MARLIN
Trust you?

NAME: DORY
Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

NAME: MARLIN
Look! Something shiny!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it.

NAME: DORY
Okay.

NAME: DORY
Boy, sure is clear up here.

NAME: MARLIN
Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.

NAME: DORY
Hey, little guy.

NAME: MARLIN
You wanted to go through the trench.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! That's a jellyfish!

NAME: DORY
Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

NAME: MARLIN
Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

NAME: DORY
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

NAME: MARLIN
I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.

NAME: DORY
Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?

NAME: MARLIN
It did. It's just that..

NAME: DORY
Ow! Ow, oww!

NAME: MARLIN
..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings.
Come here.

NAME: DORY
Ow, ow! Oww!

NAME: MARLIN
It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?

NAME: DORY
Yeah.

NAME: MARLIN/DORY
Aaaah!

NAME: MARLIN
Don't move! This is bad, Dory.

NAME: DORY
Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you,
that's it!

NAME: DORY
Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

NAME: DORY
A game?

NAME: MARLIN
A game.

NAME: DORY
A game?

NAME: MARLIN
Yes.

NAME: DORY
Aah! I love games! Pick me!

NAME: MARLIN
All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

NAME: DORY
Okay!

NAME: MARLIN
Rules, rules, rules!

NAME: DORY
Okay!

NAME: MARLIN
You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.

NAME: DORY
Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

NAME: MARLIN
W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!

NAME: DORY
Weeee!

NAME: MARLIN
Dory!

NAME: DORY
Gotta go faster if you wanna win!

NAME: DORY
Boing! Boing! Boing-boing-boing-boing!

NAME: MARLIN
Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!

NAME: DORY
Weeee!

NAME: MARLIN
So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time.
I can do this, just be careful.

NAME: DORY
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, I don't think so!

NAME: DORY
Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.

NAME: MARLIN
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

NAME: DORY
Huh? Hungry?

NAME: DORY
Ugh...am I disqualified?

NAME: MARLIN
No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where
does P. Sherman live?

NAME: DORY
P..Sherman..Wallaby Way...Sydney...

NAME: MARLIN
That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake!

NAME: DORY
Awake...P..Sherman..

NAME: MARLIN
Awake...

NAME: DORY
..42 Wallaby Way...

NAME: MARLIN
Awake...wake up...Nemo...

NAME: GILL
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

NAME: NEMO
Yeah.

NAME: GILL
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you.

NAME: NEMO
He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.

NAME: GILL
Peach, any movement?

NAME: PEACH
He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon.

NAME: GILL
Keep on him.

NAME: GILL
My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.

NAME: NEMO
Toilet?

NAME: GILL
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

NAME: NEMO
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

NAME: GILL
Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya.

NAME: BUBBLES
Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles---

NAME: PEACH
Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.

NAME: GILL
That's your cue, Sharkbait.

NAME: BLOAT
You can do it, kid.

NAME: GILL
Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber
and I'll talk you through the rest.

NAME: NEMO
Okay.

NAME: GILL
Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp.

NAME: GILL
Nicely done! Can you hear me?

NAME: NEMO
Yeah.

NAME: GILL
Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?

NAME: NEMO
Uh-huh.

NAME: GILL
Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the
fan to stop it turning.

NAME: NEMO
Aaah!

NAME: GILL
Careful, Sharkbait.

NAME: NEMO
I can't do it!

NAME: PEACH
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

NAME: GILL
He'll be fine. Try again.

NAME: NEMO
Okay.

NAME: GILL
That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

NAME: NEMO
I got it! I got it!

NAME: BLOAT
He did it!

NAME: GURGLE
Whew!

NAME: GILL
That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.

Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!

NAME: NEMO
No! No!

NAME: GILL
Feed me more!

NAME: GURGLE
That's it!

NAME: GILL
Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!

NAME: NEMO
I got it!

NAME: GILL
Pull!

NAME: PEACH
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

NAME: GILL
No. We're done.

NAME: SQUIRT
You rock, dude.

NAME: MARLIN
Ow.

NAME: CRUSH
Curl away, my son. Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em
on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue.

NAME: MARLIN
All by themselves?

NAME: CRUSH
Yeah.

NAME: MARLIN
But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?

Well, you never really know. But when they'll know, you'll know, you know? Ha.

Hey! Look, everybody!

Well, go on, jump on him.

NAME: TURTLE KIDS
Turtle pile!

NAME: MARLIN
W-w-wai-wait--

NAME: TURTLE KID 1
Are you funny?

NAME: TURTLE KID 2
Where's your shell?

NAME: MARLIN
Hold on, I need to breath--

NAME: TURTLE KID 3
Are you running away?

NAME: TURTLE KID 4
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?

NAME: TURTLE KID 5
Did they sting you?

NAME: MARLIN
One at a time!

NAME: TURTLE KID 6
Mr. Fish, did you die?

NAME: DORY
Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

NAME: SQUIRT
So where are you going?

NAME: MARLIN
Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

NAME: DORY
No way.

NAME: SQUIRT
What happened?

NAME: MARLIN
No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.

NAME: TURTLE KIDS
Awww! Please?

NAME: SQUIRT
Pleeeease?

NAME: DORY
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

NAME: MARLIN
And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been
so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...

NAME: TURTLE KID
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

NAME: SMALL FISH
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

NAME: BIG FISH
Golly, that's amazing!

NAME: SMALL FISH
And then dives thousands of..

NAME: LOBSTER
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

NAME: SWORDFISH
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...

NAME: DOLPHIN
So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.

NAME: FEMALE BIRD
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

NAME: MALE BIRD 1
..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

NAME: MALE BIRD 2
..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

NAME: MALE BIRD 3
That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

NAME: GULLS
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NAME: NIGEL
Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!

NAME: PELICAN

He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

NAME: NIGEL
There, take it! You happy!

Ho ho! Brilliant!

NAME: DEB
Is he doing okay?

NAME: GURGLE
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R..

NAME: NEMO
It's okay, I know who you're talking about.

NAME: NEMO
Gill? Gill?

NAME: GILL
Hey, Sharkbait.

NAME: NEMO
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

NAME: GILL
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that
ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that.
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

NAME: NIGEL
All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--!

NAME: DENTIST
What the!?

NAME: PATIENT
AAAAAAAAAH!!! Oooooh...

NAME: DENTIST
Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth. He he he he he! Huh, darn kids. Well, good
thing I pulled the right one, eh, prime minister? He he he he!

NAME: NIGEL
Hey, hey. Psst!

NAME: PEACH
Oh, Nigel. You just missed an extraction.

NAME: NIGEL
Ooh! Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what I'm talkin' about!? Nemo!
Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.

NAME: NEMO
What? What is it?

NAME: NIGEL
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

NAME: NEMO
My father? Really?

NAME: GILL
Really?

NAME: NIGEL
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and
all sorts of--

NAME: NEMO
Sharks? That can't be him.

NAME: NIGEL
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..

NAME: NEMO
Marlin?

NAME: NIGEL
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

NAME: NEMO
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

NAME: NIGEL
I heard he took on three.

NAME: DEB/BLOAT/GURGLE
Three!?

NAME: GILL
Three sharks!?

NAME: BLOAT
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!

NAME: NIGEL
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.

NAME: NEMO
Really?

NAME: NIGEL
He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him   and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with   huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right
now, to Sydney!

NAME: BLOAT
Wow! Ha ha ha!

NAME: DEB
Oh, what a good daddy!

NAME: GILL
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.

NAME: GURGLE
He's swimming to the filter!

NAME: BLOAT
Not again!

NAME: GILL
Sharkbait!

NAME: DEB
No!

NAME: GURGLE
You've got your whole life ahead of you!

NAME: BLOAT
Oh no!

NAME: GILL
We'll help you, kid!

NAME: BLOAT
Gotta get him out!

NAME: DEB
Gimme that thing!

NAME: DEB
Get him outta there!

NAME: GURGLE
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

NAME: DEB
Sharkbait!

NAME: BLOAT
Sharkbait! Are you okay!?

NAME: GURGLE
No!

NAME: GILL
Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!?

NAME: NEMO
Yeah, I can hear you.

NAME: GILL
Sharkbait, you did it!

NAME: GURGLE
Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs! Aaaaaaah!!!

NAME: GILL
That took guts, kid.

NAME: JACQUES
Oui!

NAME: GILL
No cleaning.

NAME: JACQUES
I shall resist.

NAME: GILL
Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank
so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.

NAME: GILL
Good work.

NAME: NEMO
Ha ha ha ha!

NAME: CRUSH
All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!

NAME: MARLIN
Where!? I don't see it!

NAME: DORY
Right there! I see it! I see it!

NAME: MARLIN
You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?

NAME: CRUSH
That's it, dude!

NAME: MARLIN
Of course it is.

NAME: CRUSH
Okay, first: find your exit buddy!

NAME: CRUSH
Do you have your exit buddy?

NAME: DORY
Yes!

NAME: CRUSH
Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!

NAME: SQUIRT
Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today! Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit
the wall! There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and
punch it!

NAME: MARLIN
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't
know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!

NAME: CRUSH
Okay, Jellyman! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

NAME: MARLIN/DORY
Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!!
Whoooooaaa!!!

NAME: DORY
Whoooo!

NAME: DORY
Hey, look! Turtles!

NAME: CRUSH
Ha ha! Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through
to Sydney! No worries, man!

NAME: MARLIN
No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

NAME: TURTLE KIDS
Bye! Bye, Jellyman!

NAME: CRUSH
You tell your little dude I said 'hi', okay?

NAME: SQUIRT
See you later, dudes!

NAME: DORY
Bye, everyone!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?

NAME: CRUSH
Hundred and fifty, dude! And still young! Rock on!

NAME: MARLIN
Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that.

NAME: DORY
Whoa. We goin' in there?

NAME: MARLIN
Yup.

NAME: DORY
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

NAME: MARLIN
Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory?

NAME: MARLIN
Boy, this is taking a while.

NAME: DORY
Hey, how about we play a game?

NAME: MARLIN
Okay.

NAME: DORY
Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small..

NAME: MARLIN
It's me.

NAME: DORY
Right. Okay..

NAME: DORY
..orange, and uh, small..

NAME: MARLIN
It's me.

NAME: DORY
All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.

NAME: DORY
..orange and small, and white stripes..

NAME: MARLIN
Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.

NAME: DORY
Okay, that's just scary.

NAME: MARLIN
W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!

NAME: DORY
Hey. Hey!

NAME: MARLIN
We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
Wha--?

NAME: DORY
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out
our bones!

NAME: DORY
What is it with men and asking for directions?

NAME: MARLIN
Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
'Let's Not Die' card.

NAME: DORY
You wanna get outta here, don't you?

NAME: MARLIN
Of course, I do.

NAME: DORY
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm?
Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.

NAME: MARLIN
All right.

NAME: DORY
Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.

NAME: MARLIN
Ha..hello.

NAME: DORY
His son Bingo..

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo.

NAME: DORY
..Nemo, was taken to, uh..

NAME: MARLIN
Sydney.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.

NAME: DORY
Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale.

NAME: MARLIN
Uh, Dory..what're you doing?

NAME: MARLIN
What're you doing?

NAME: MARLIN
Are you sure you speak whale?

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.

NAME: MARLIN
He's not coming back. You offended him.

NAME: DORY
Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!

NAME: MARLIN
Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.

NAME: DORY
Maybe I should try humpback.

NAME: MARLIN
No, don't try humpback.

NAME: MARLIN
Okay, you actually sound sick.

NAME: DORY
Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!

NAME: MARLIN
Don't do that!

NAME: DORY
Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?

NAME: MARLIN
It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!

NAME: MARLIN
It's just as well, he might be hungry.

NAME: DORY
Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill.

NAME: DORY
Oh, look. Krill.

NAME: MARLIN
Move, Dory! Move!

NAME: DORY
Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

NAME: GILL
Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to
you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning!

NAME: JACQUES
I am ashamed.

NAME: PEACH
Hey, look. Scum angel.

Aah! Aaaah! Ooh-ooh! Aaaaah!

Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own--

NAME: PEACH
Shhh! Here he comes.

NAME: DENTIST
Crikey, what a state. Oh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

NAME: BARBARA
Uh, ten 'o clock, luv.

NAME: DENTIST
Leave it open, would you? I gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

NAME: GILL
He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

NAME: NEMO
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean!

NAME: GILL
Are you ready to see your dad, kid?

NAME: NEMO
Uh-huh.

NAME: GILL
Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor
waitin' for you right now.

NAME: NEMO
Yeah.

Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!

NAME: DORY
Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!

NAME: MARLIN
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

NAME: DORY
Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!

NAME: MARLIN
Would you just stop it!?

NAME: DORY
Why? What's wrong?

NAME: MARLIN
We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?

NAME: DORY
A whale?

NAME: MARLIN
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!

NAME: DORY
Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.

NAME: DORY
Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?

NAME: DORY
There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay.

NAME: MARLIN
No. No, it won't.

NAME: DORY
Sure it will, you'll see.

NAME: MARLIN
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

NAME: DORY
Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.

NAME: MARLIN
What?

NAME: DORY
Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.

NAME: DORY
Hmm..

NAME: MARLIN
What's going on?

NAME: DORY
I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..

NAME: MARLIN
Dory. Dory.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory.

NAME: DORY
I think he says we've stopped.

NAME: DORY
Really? You sure about that?

NAME: MARLIN
Look, it's already half-empty!

NAME: DORY
Hmm..I'd say it's half full.

NAME: MARLIN
Stop that! It's half-empty!

NAME: DORY
Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat
or he wants a root beer float.

NAME: MARLIN
Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!?
Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!

NAME: DORY
Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--

NAME: MARLIN
Stop talking to him--waaaah!

NAME: DORY
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

NAME: MARLIN
What is going on!?

NAME: DORY
I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--!

NAME: MARLIN
No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!

NAME: DORY
Yes, I can!

NAME: MARLIN
No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!

NAME: DORY
Okay.

NAME: MARLIN
Dory!

NAME: DORY
He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!

NAME: DORY
I don't!

NAME: MARLIN
Ha ha ha! We're alive!

NAME: DORY
Look! Sy-d-ney..Sydney! Uh, Sydney! Sydney again!

NAME: MARLIN
You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son!

NAME: DORY
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

NAME: MARLIN
Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.

NAME: DORY
Right!

NAME: MARLIN
Come on, Dory. We can do this!

NAME: DEB
But how?

NAME: GILL

Now go! Hurry!

NAME: NEMO
Tell all of the fish to swim down!

NAME: MARLIN
Well!? You heard my son! Come on!

NAME: NEMO
Dory!

NAME: NEMO
You have to tell everybody to..

NAME: MARLIN
..swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you!? Swim down!

NAME: DORY
Everybody swim down!

NAME: NEMO
Come on! You have to swim down!

NAME: DORY
Swim down, okay?

NAME: NEMO
Swim..

NAME: MARLIN
down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down!

NAME: MARLIN
Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming!

NAME: NEMO
It's working!

NAME: FISH
Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming!

NAME: MARLIN
Just keep swimming! Keep swimming!

NAME: NEMO
Come on, dad!

NAME: MARLIN
You're doing great, son!

NAME: NEMO
That's my dad!

NAME: MARLIN
Come on! Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming!

NAME: MARLIN
Almost there! Keep swimming!

NAME: FISH
Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Yay!

NAME: MARLIN
Oww!

NAME: DORY
Hey!

NAME: MARLIN
Dory! Where's Nemo!?

NAME: MARLIN
Oh no. Nemo!

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you.

NAME: MARLIN
Oh, thank goodness.

NAME: NEMO
Dad...I don't hate you.

NAME: MARLIN
No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo.

NAME: MARLIN
Hey, guess what?

NAME: NEMO
What?

NAME: MARLIN
Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old.

NAME: NEMO
Hundred and fifty?

NAME: MARLIN
Yep.

NAME: NEMO
'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a hundred.

NAME: MARLIN
Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as
Sandy Plankton!?

NAME: NEMO
Ha ha ha ha!

NAME: MARLIN
He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?

NAME: MARLIN
Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go!

NAME: MARLIN
I'm gonna win!

NAME: NEMO
No, you're not! I did it! Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

NAME: MARLIN
Oh! My own son beats me!

NAME: MR. RAY
Climb aboard, explorers!

NAME: MARLIN
So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these,
who needs anemones?'!

NAME: BOB/TED/BILL
Haaa-ha ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: MR. RAY
Well, hello, Nemo! Who's this?

NAME: NEMO
Exchange student.

NAME: SQUIRT
I'm from the EAC, dude!

NAME: MR. RAY
Sweet.

NAME: NEMO/SQUIRT
Totally.

NAME: BOB
But seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did?

NAME: BRUCE
Uh, pardon me.

NAME: BRUCE
Hello.

NAME: TED
Ohh!

NAME: BRUCE
Don't be alarmed.

NAME: ANCHOR
Oh, we just wanna make sure that our newest member got home safe.

NAME: DORY
Thanks, guys.

NAME: BRUCE
Well, we'll see you next week.

NAME: CHUM
Keep up with the program, Dory.

NAME: ANCHOR
Remember: fish are friends..

NAME: DORY
..not food! Bye!

NAME: MR. RAY
Hold on! Here we go! Next up, knowledge!

NAME: MARLIN
Bye, son! Have fun!

NAME: NEMO
Bye, dad! Oh! Oh, Mr. Ray! Wait. I forgot something.

NAME: NEMO
Love you, dad.

NAME: MARLIN
I love you too, son.

NAME: NEMO
Uh, dad, you can let go now.

NAME: MARLIN
Sorry! Now go have an adventure!

NAME: SQUIRT
Goodbye! See you later, dudes!

NAME: DORY
Bye, Elmo!

NAME: MARLIN
Nemo.

NAME: NEMO
See you after school, Dory! Bye, dad!

NAME: MARLIN
Bye, son.

NAME: DENTIST
Barbara?

NAME: BARBARA
Uh-huh?

NAME: DENTIST
I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks! Had to clean
the tank myself, take all the fish out, put 'em in bags and---where'd the fish go?

NAME: GILL
Come on, Peach!

NAME: DEB
Hurry!

NAME: GILL
You can do it!

NAME: BLOAT
Yeah, that's it! You can do it!

NAME: GURGLE
Just a little further!

NAME: PEACH
That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!

NAME: BLOAT
Come on, Peach!

NAME: PEACH
Oooh--aaaaah!

NAME: ALL
Yay! We did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: BLOAT
Now what?

NAME: LELAND TURBO
This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have
a flash transmission for Agent Finn
McMissile.

NAME: LELAND TURBO
Finn. My cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

NAME: LELAND TURBO
You won't believe what I've found
out here.

NAME: LELAND TURBO
This is bigger than anything we've
ever seen. And no one even knows it
exists. Finn, I need backup. But
don't call the cavalry - it could
blow the operation. And be careful.
It's not safe out here!

NAME: LELAND TURBO
Transmitting my grids now. Good
luck!

NAME: CRABBY
Alright buddy, we're here. Right
where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?

NAME: FINN
I'm looking for a car.

NAME: CRABBY
A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
further away from land than out
here.

NAME: FINN
Exactly where I want to be.

NAME: CRABBY
Well I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

NAME: COMBAT SHIP
What are you doing out here?

NAME: CRABBY
What does it look like, genius? I'm
crabbing!

NAME: COMBAT SHIP
Well turn around and go back where
you came from.

NAME: CRABBY
Yeah? And who's gonna make me?

NAME: CRABBY
Alright, alright! Don't get your
prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Too many cars here. Out of my way!

NAME: FINN
Professor Zundapp?

NAME: NOSY PACER
You wanted to see this before we
load it?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Ah, yes. Very carefully...

NAME: NOSY PACER
Oh. A TV camera. What does it
actually do?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
This camera is extremely dangerous.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
This is valuable equipment. Make
sure it is properly secured for the
voyage.

NAME: NOSY PACER
You got it.

NAME: GREM
This is one of those British spies
we told you about.

NAME: ACER
Yeah. This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Agent Leland Turbo.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
camera! Kill him!!

NAME: ACER
He's getting away!

NAME: COMBAT SHIP
Not for long.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
gone, who can stop us now?

NAME: MATER
Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
here to help you!

NAME: MATER
Hey, Otis!

NAME: OTIS
Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
thought I could make it this time,
but...
(he tries to start his
engine, stalls)
Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
am I kidding? I'll always be a
lemon.

NAME: MATER
Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
look on the bright side: This is
your tenth tow this month, so that
means it's on the house.

NAME: OTIS
You're the only one that's nice to
lemons like me, Mater.

NAME: MATER
Don't sweat it. These things happen
to everybody, Otis.

NAME: OTIS
But you never leak oil.

NAME: MATER
Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
tell nobody, but I think my rust is
starting to show through.

NAME: OTIS
Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?

NAME: MATER
Not yet.

NAME: OTIS
He must be crazy-excited about
winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!

NAME: MATER
Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
get back `cause we got a whole
summer's worth of best friend fun
to make up for. Just me and --

NAME: MATER
--- McQueen!

NAME: OTIS
Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
don't need to go so fast!

NAME: LUIGI
Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.

NAME: FLO
Good to have you back, honey.

NAME: FILLMORE
Congratulations, man.

NAME: SARGE
Welcome home, soldier.

NAME: SHERIFF
The place wasn't the same without
you, son.

NAME: LIZZIE
What? Did he go somewhere?

NAME: MCQUEEN
It's good to be home, everybody.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater!

NAME: MATER
McQueen!

NAME: OTIS
Woaahhhhh!

NAME: RAMONE
Hey. How far'd you make it this
time, Otis?

NAME: OTIS
Halfway to the county line.

NAME: RAMONE
Not bad, man.

NAME: OTIS
I know, I can't believe it either!

NAME: MATER
McQueen, welcome back!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, it's so good to see you.

NAME: MATER
You too, buddy.

NAME: MATER
Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
the things I got planned for us.

NAME: MACK
These best friend greetings get
longer every year.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Well, actually I've got something
to show you first.

NAME: MATER
Wow. I can't believe they renamed
the Piston Cup after our very own
Doc Hudson.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I know Doc said these things were
just old cups, but to have someone
else win it just didn't feel right,
you know?

NAME: MATER
Well, Doc would've been real proud
of you. That's for sure.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
summer for this. What've you got
planned?

NAME: MATER
You sure you can handle it?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Come on, you know who you're
talking to? This is Lightning
McQueen. I can handle anything.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Uh.... Mater?!

NAME: MATER
Just remember, your brakes ain't
gonna work on these!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Come on, come on! Faster, faster!

NAME: MATER
This is gonna be good!

NAME: MATER
Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.

NAME: MATER
Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir?

NAME: MATER
This new dent!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...

NAME: MATER
Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
you see what I got planned for
tonight.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
thinking of just a quiet dinner.

NAME: MATER
That's exactly what I was thinking.

NAME: MCQUEEN
No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.

NAME: MATER
Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
going out for supper.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, I meant it would be just me
and Sally.

NAME: MATER
Oh.

NAME: MCQUEEN
It's just for tonight. We'll do
whatever you want tomorrow.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Thanks for understanding.

NAME: MATER
Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
fun now.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!

NAME: SALLY
This is so nice.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I can't tell you how good it is to
be here alone. Just the two of us.
Finally, you and me ---

NAME: MATER
My name is Mater and I'll be your
waiter.
Mater the waiter. That's funny
right there.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, you work here?

NAME: MATER
Well yeah I work here. What'd you
think, I just snuck in here when
nobody was looking and pretended to
be your waiter, just so I could
hang out with you?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
be?

NAME: MATER
Now, can I start you two lovebirds
off with a couple drinks?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yes. I'll have my usual.

NAME: SALLY
You know what? I'm going to have
that too.

NAME: MATER
Uh, right. Your usual.

NAME: MATER
Guido! What's McQueen's usual?

NAME: GUIDO
How should I know?

NAME: MATER
Perfect! Give me two of `em.

NAME: SARGE
Quiet! My program's on.

NAME: SARGE
Uh-oh...

NAME: MCQUEEN
Hey, what's going on over there?

NAME: SALLY
Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
there's a crowd.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Wait, why do you know his name? And
don't say it like that. It's three
syllables, not ten.

NAME: SALLY
What? He's nice to look at. You
know, open-wheeled and all.

NAME: MCQUEEN
What's wrong with fenders? I
thought you like my fenders.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater?

NAME: MATER
Ha ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Those are strong words from a car
that is so fragile.

NAME: MCQUEEN
"Not so fast." What is that, your
new motto?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Well, I would love to. The only
thing is my crew's off for the
season so ---

NAME: GUIDO
Pit stop.

NAME: MCQUEEN
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!

NAME: MCQUEEN
I know, I know. I just got back.
But we won't be long and ---

NAME: SALLY
Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
got enough to do here. Mater's
going to have a blast though.
You're bringing Mater, right? You
never bring him to any of your
races.

NAME: SALLY
Just let him sit in the pits, give
him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
thrill of a lifetime for him.

NAME: MATER
Your drinks, sir.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater.

NAME: MATER
I didn't taste it!

NAME: MCQUEEN
How'd you like to come and see the
world with me?

NAME: MATER
You mean it?

NAME: MCQUEEN
You got me into this thing. You're
coming along.

NAME: LUIGI
Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
Let's go!

NAME: MATER
You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
that?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater!

NAME: LEWIS HAMILTON
Hey, McQueen, over here!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Hey, Jeff. Lewis!

NAME: MATER
Hey! You done good! You got all the
leaves!

NAME: JEFF GORVETTE
Check out that tow truck.

NAME: LEWIS HAMILTON
I wonder who that guy's with?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Will you guys excuse me just for
one little second?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
Springs.

NAME: MATER
You're just realizing that? Boy,
that jet-lag really done a number
on you.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, look -- things are different
over here. Which means maybe you
should, you know, act a little
different too.

NAME: MATER
Different than what?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Well, just... help me out here,
buddy. I ---

NAME: MATER
You need help? Shoot, why didn't
you just say so? That's what a tow
truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
Mr. San Francisco!

NAME: MATER
I'll introduce you.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, no.

NAME: MATER
Look at me -- I'm helping you
already!

NAME: MATER
Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
to meet ---

NAME: FRANCESCO
Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Nice to meet you, Francesco.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
very good-looking. Not as good as I
thought, but you're good.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Anything for McQueen's friend.

NAME: MATER
Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
sees this. She's Lightning
McQueen's girlfriend.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Oooh.

NAME: MATER
She's a big fan of yours.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Hey, she has good taste.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.

NAME: MATER
You're right. She's a huge fan. She
goes on and on about your open
wheels here.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going "on and on."

NAME: FRANCESCO
Francesco is familiar with this
reaction to Francesco. Women
respect a car that has nothing to
hide.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yeah, uh...

NAME: FRANCESCO
Let us have a toast.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Let's.

NAME: FRANCESCO
I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
Miss Sally.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
win tomorrow to her. So if we both
do it, it's really not so special.
Besides, I don't have a drink.

NAME: MATER
I'll go get you one. You mind if I
borrow a few bucks for one of them
drinks?

NAME: MCQUEEN
They're free, Mater.

NAME: MATER
Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
here?

NAME: MCQUEEN
I should probably go keep an eye on
him. See you at the race.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Yes, you will see Francesco. But
not like this.

NAME: FRANCESCO
You will see him like this, as he
drives away from you.

NAME: MCQUEEN
That's cute. So you had one of
those made up for all the racers?

NAME: FRANCESCO
No.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Okay.

NAME: MCQUEEN
He is so getting beat tomorrow.

NAME: VOICE
Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
Axlerod!

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
It is my absolute honor to
introduce to you the competitors in
the first-ever World Grand Prix.
From Brazil. Number eight...

NAME: HOLLEY
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

NAME: FINN
That's because it's air-cooled.

NAME: HOLLEY
I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
have a message from London.

NAME: FINN
Not here.
You must try the canapes on the
mezzanine!

NAME: FINN
So the lab boys analyzed the photo
I sent? What did they learn about
the camera?

NAME: HOLLEY
It appears to be a standard
television camera. They said if you
could get closer photos next time,
that would be great.

NAME: FINN
This was London's message?

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
platforms you were on? Turns out
they're sitting on the biggest oil
reserve in the world.

NAME: FINN
How did we miss that?

NAME: HOLLEY
They'd been scrambling everyone's
satellites. The Americans actually
discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that
platform, under deep cover. He was
able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

NAME: FINN
Who is it? Has anyone seen the
photo yet?

NAME: HOLLEY
No, not yet. The American is here
tonight to pass it to you. He'll
signal you when he's ready.

NAME: FINN
Oh no.

NAME: HOLLEY
What is it?

NAME: FINN
Change of plan. You're meeting the
American.

NAME: HOLLEY
What, me?

NAME: FINN
Those thugs down there were on the
oil platform. If they see me, the
whole mission is compromised.

NAME: HOLLEY
No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
agent.

NAME: FINN
You are now.

NAME: MATER
I'll take one of them.

NAME: MATER
Never know which one McQueen'll
have a hankering for.

NAME: MATER
Hey, what you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

NAME: SUSHI CHEF
No, no. Wasabi.

NAME: MATER
Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
with you? That looks delicious.

NAME: MATER
Uh, a little more, please.
It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more. Come
on, let's go, it's free! You're
getting there... Scoop scoop!

NAME: MATER
There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
ice cream.

NAME: SUSHI CHEF
My condolences.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
... and now, our last competitor ---
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
to racing. This is a great
opportunity.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
Lightning. You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism to
this competition.

NAME: MATER
Somebody get me water!

NAME: MATER
Whatever you do, do not eat the
free pistachio ice cream. It has
turned!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
Mater.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
I know him. This is the bloke that
called into the television show.
You're the one I have to thank.

NAME: MATER
No, thank you. This trip's been
amazing.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater!

NAME: MATER
But wait, I... oh, shoot.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene.

NAME: MATER
But I never leak oil. Never.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Go take care of yourself right now.

NAME: MATER
Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
you. I gotta go!

NAME: MATER
Sorry ladies!

NAME: MATER
I never leak I never leak I never
leak...

NAME: MATER
Wowee...

NAME: MATER
What in the---

NAME: ROD REDLINE
Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's
time for the drop.

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh, you've got to be joking.

NAME: FINN
What's the problem, Shiftwell?

NAME: HOLLEY
He's in the loo.

NAME: FINN
So go in!

NAME: HOLLEY
I can't just go into the men's loo.

NAME: FINN
Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.

NAME: MATER
Whatever you do, I would not go in
there.

NAME: MATER
A Gremlin and a Pacer!

NAME: MATER
No offense to your makes and
models, but you guys break down
harder than my cousin Betsy after
she got left at the ---

NAME: MATER
--- altar!

NAME: MATER
Are you okay?

NAME: ROD REDLINE
I'm fine.

NAME: GREM
Hey. Tow truck.

NAME: GREM
We'd like to get to our private
business here, if you don't mind.

NAME: MATER
Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the
way of your "private business."
Oh! A little advice: When you hear
her giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.

NAME: GREM
Thank you.

NAME: MATER
It's to adjust the temperature.

NAME: ACER
Got it.

NAME: MATER
Remember it's in Celsius, not
Fahrenheit.

NAME: GREM AND ACER
Get outta here!

NAME: MATER
Alright then.

NAME: MATER
Excuse me, ma'am.

NAME: MATER
Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin'
to get funky!

NAME: HOLLEY
Hello.

NAME: MATER
Well, hello.

NAME: HOLLEY
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

NAME: MATER
Well of course it doesn't. That's
`cause it's air-cooled!

NAME: MATER
Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the
only ones. Besides the Beetles you
had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with
the pancake motors...

NAME: HOLLEY
Yeah. Okay, I get it---

NAME: MATER
... And before both of them,
there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy
Fillmore's one of them.

NAME: HOLLEY
Listen! We should find somewhere
more private.

NAME: MATER
Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a
little, uh ---

NAME: MATER
Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be
out there at the races.

NAME: HOLLEY
Got it. We'll rendezvous then.

NAME: MCQUEEN
There you are. Where have you been?

NAME: MATER
What's a rendezvous?

NAME: LUIGI
It's like a date.

NAME: MATER
A date?!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, what's going on?

NAME: MATER
Well, what's going on is I've got
me a date tomorrow.

NAME: LUIGI
Guido don't believe you.

NAME: MATER
Well, believe it. My new girlfriend
just said so. Hey, there she is.

NAME: MATER
See ya tomorrow!

NAME: LUIGI
Guido still don't believe you.

NAME: GREM
--- you tricked us real good.

NAME: ACER
And we don't like being tricked.

NAME: ACER
Hey, what's so funny?

NAME: ROD REDLINE
Well, you know, I was just wearing
a disguise. You guys are stuck
looking like that.

NAME: ROD REDLINE
Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
this stuff is good for you.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Allinol by itself is good for you.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
But after microscopic examination,
I have found that it has one small
weakness. When hit with an
electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
extremely dangerous.

NAME: GREM
--- for the camera.

NAME: ROD REDLINE
Is that all you want? I got a whole
act.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
You were very interested in this
camera on the oil platform. Now you
will witness what it really does.

NAME: ROD REDLINE
Whatever you say, Professor.

NAME: ACER
You talked up a lot of cars last
night. Which one's your associate?

NAME: ROD REDLINE
Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
was your sister. You know, I can't
tell them apart these days.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Fifty percent power.
This camera is actually an
electromagnetic pulse emitter.

NAME: ACER
What about her? Did you give it to
her?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
The Allinol is now heating to a
boil, dramatically expanding,
causing the engine block to crack
under the stress, forcing oil into
the combustion chamber.

NAME: ACER
How about him? You talk to him?

NAME: ROD REDLINE
What do I care? I can replace an
engine block.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
You may be able to, but after full
impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.

NAME: ACER
How about him? Does he have it?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
That's him. He's the one.

NAME: GREM
Roger that, Professor Z.

NAME: ROD REDLINE
No!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
The project is still on schedule.
You will find this second agent ---

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
--- and kill him.

NAME: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with
racing legends Darrell Cartrip and
David Hobbscap. There's never been
a competition like this before.

NAME: DAVID HOBBSCAP
Really, Darrell, I think you need
to clean your windshield. You're
clearly not seeing this for what it
is: Francesco's race to lose.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Really? You are "speed"? Then
Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
really getting him into the zone!

NAME: MCQUEEN
He is so getting beat today.

NAME: SARGE
His suspension stats look good.

NAME: LUIGI
Tire pressure is excellent.

NAME: FILLMORE
He's got plenty of fuel.

NAME: MATER
And he's awesome!

NAME: HOLLEY
Why is he in the pits? He's so
exposed.

NAME: FINN
It's his cover. One of the best
I've seen, too. Look at the detail
on that rust. It must have cost him
a fortune.

NAME: HOLLEY
But why hasn't he contacted us yet?

NAME: FINN
There's probably heat on him. Be
patient.

NAME: HOLLEY
Right, of course. He'll signal us
when he can.

NAME: FINN
And then we find out who's behind
all this.

NAME: MATER
McQueen! It's time to make your
move. Get on the outside and show
'em what Doc done taught you.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!

NAME: GREM
Roger that.

NAME: GREM
You gotta be kidding me.

NAME: ACER
What is it?

NAME: GREM
It's that tow truck from the
bathroom.

NAME: ACER
The one from the bathroom?

NAME: GREM
Yeah, the one the American Agent
passed the device to.

NAME: ACER
What about him?

NAME: GREM
What about him? He's in the pits!

NAME: ACER
Not for long.

NAME: HOLLEY
Hold on. I think I've got
something.

NAME: FINN
What is it?

NAME: HOLLEY
The Pacer from the party last
night.

NAME: HOLLEY
Cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks... Yep. His
VIN numbers match.

NAME: FINN
Anyone with him? He won't be alone.

NAME: HOLLEY
Conducting analysis on the target.

NAME: HOLLEY
He's not the only one here.
Three... five... they're
everywhere. And they're all closing
in on... oh no.

NAME: HOLLEY
Finn? Finn, where are you?

NAME: MATER
Wow! Some of them fellers is really
loud.

NAME: MATER
Uh, what?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Guys, a little too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

NAME: MATER
Is there gonna be cable where you
is so I can watch the rest of the
race?

NAME: MATER
Well, all right but I usually like
to have a proper detailing done
before I meet a lady friend.

NAME: ACER
Finn McMissile? But you're dead!

NAME: FINN
Then this shouldn't hurt at all.

NAME: FINN
Miss Shiftwell?

NAME: HOLLEY
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages. Multiple
assailants are closing in quickly.

NAME: MATER
Hey, new lady friend? You like
flowers?

NAME: MCQUEEN
What?

NAME: MATER
Stay outside. Gotcha.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Outside?

NAME: FRANCESCO
Grazie and arrivaderci!

NAME: ACER
This time I'm gonna make sure you
stay dead.

NAME: MATER
What's that? You want me to head
toward that ruckus?

NAME: MATER
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

NAME: MATER
That was cool! Hey, can I get your
autograph?

NAME: MATER
Hey, where'd he go?

NAME: MATER
Dadgum, did I miss our date?

NAME: DARRELL CARTRIP
Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
your strategy today?

NAME: FRANCESCO
Strategia? Francesco needs no
strategy, it's very simple. You
start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then
win. Francesco always wins. It's
boring.

NAME: FRANCESCO
To truly crush one's dream, you
must first raise their hopes very
high.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater.

NAME: MATER
Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
race over? You won, right?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, why were you yelling things
at me while I was racing?

NAME: MATER
Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
funny right there. Nah, see that's
`cause I seen these two fellers
doing some sort of karate street
performance. It was nutso. One of
them even had a flamethrower ---

NAME: MCQUEEN
A flamethrower? What are you
talking about? I don't understand.
Where were you?

NAME: MATER
Going to meet my date.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Your date?

NAME: MATER
She started talking to me as a
voice in my head, telling me where
to go ---

NAME: MCQUEEN
What?

NAME: MATER
Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
up, did I?

NAME: MCQUEEN
I lost the race because of you!

NAME: MATER
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---

NAME: MCQUEEN
An imaginary girlfriend,
flamethrowers. This is exactly why
I don't bring you along to these
things.

NAME: MATER
Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
somebody and explained what
happened I could help.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I don't need your help. I don't
want your help.

NAME: PRESS
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah, what happened?

NAME: MCQUEEN
I made a mistake. But I can assure
you, it won't happen again.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Look, guys. We know what the
problem is and we've taken care of
it.

NAME: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
Lightning McQueen loses in the last
lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
first race of the World Grand Prix
and three, count em, three cars
flamed out leading some to suggest
that their fuel, Allinol, might be
to blame.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
is safe! There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out!

NAME: DARRELL CARTRIP
Well the jury may still be out on
whether Allinol caused these
accidents, but one thing's for
sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
race.

NAME: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
Team McQueen can't be happy right
now.

NAME: SECURITY CAR
Come with me please, sir.

NAME: MATER
But I'm gonna miss my plane.

NAME: SECURITY CAR
Right this way.

NAME: MATER
Doggone it. This is about my hook,
isn't it? I know I should've
checked it, but I can't really,
look -- it's attached to me.

NAME: MATER
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

NAME: FINN
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British
Intelligence.

NAME: MATER
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

NAME: FINN
Who are you with? FBI, CIA?

NAME: MATER
Let's just say I'm triple-A
affiliated. You know, I know some
karate. I don't wanna brag or
nothing, but I've got me a black
fan belt.

NAME: MATER
Hey, you wanna see some moves I
made up?

NAME: FINN
You're being followed.

NAME: MATER
This first one I can reach into a
car's hood, pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he
stalls. I call it, "What I
accidentally did to my friend Luigi
once."

NAME: GREM
There he is!

NAME: MATER
Look, I probably ought to go. I'm
about to miss my flight.

NAME: FINN
Don't worry.

NAME: FINN
I've taken care of that. Hang on.

NAME: MATER
This is First Class service. You
don't even have to go through the
terminal.

NAME: FINN
Drive forward. Whatever you do,
don't stop.

NAME: MATER
Is everything okay back there?

NAME: FINN
Roger that.

NAME: MATER
I knew I should've done carry-on!

NAME: MATER
Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary
girlfriend!

NAME: HOLLEY
Come on! Get in here!

NAME: FINN
Hold on, Sid!

NAME: SIDDELEY
Finn, it's now or never!

NAME: SIDDELEY
Hold on!

NAME: MCQUEEN
"I'm so sorry for what I did. I
don't want to be the cause of you
losing any more races. I want you
to go prove to the world what I
already know - that you are the
greatest race car in the whole wide
world. Your best friend, Mater."

NAME: MCQUEEN
I didn't really want him to leave.

NAME: LUIGI
NAME: PP."
Wait, there's more here.
"P.S. Please tell the hotel I
didn't mean to order that movie. I
thought it was just a preview and I
didn't realize I was paying for it.
P.P.S... That's funny right there --
There's a few more pages of P.S.'s
here.

NAME: FINN
Now that's how I like to start the
day! You never feel more alive than
when you're almost dead.

NAME: MATER
That's the closest I ever been to
missing my flight! That was ---

NAME: HOLLEY
Still in one piece, great.

NAME: MATER
I gotta go to a doctor. I keep
getting these sharp pains in my
undercarriage.

NAME: HOLLEY
Downloading the photo now.

NAME: MATER
Hey, lemme introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomething-or-
other. He's a First Class VIP
airport whatchamacallit. And Finn,
this here's my date.
I never did get your name.

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

NAME: FINN
Finally. Time to see who's behind
all this.

NAME: HOLLEY
What is this?

NAME: MATER
Well, that's one of the worst
engines ever made. It's an old
aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what. Them ain't metric,
they ain't inches...

NAME: HOLLEY
Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is
this, Mater?

NAME: MATER
Well, it's kinda hard to tell from
this picture, ain't it?

NAME: HOLLEY
But you're the one who took it.

NAME: FINN
Holley.

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good
agent gets what he can, then gets
out before he's killed." Sorry.

NAME: MATER
Agent? You mean like insurance
agent, like,
`Like a good neighbor, Mater is
there'? Wait, you mean secret
agents. You guys is spies!

NAME: FINN
Holley, in how many makes and
models did this type of engine
appear?

NAME: HOLLEY
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period. At least
35,000 cars were made with this
engine.

NAME: MATER
You're pretty.

NAME: MATER
And so nice.

NAME: HOLLEY
Just pay attention.

NAME: FINN
This seems like a dead end. If
there were something in the photo
that could narrow this down a bit
I'd be a lot happier.

NAME: MATER
You might not be happy, but I bet
this feller is. See how he's had
most of his parts replaced? And see
all them boxes over there? Them's
all original parts. They ain't easy
to come by.

NAME: HOLLEY
Rare parts.

NAME: FINN
That's something we can track.

NAME: HOLLEY
Exactly!

NAME: FINN
Well done, Mater! I would never
have seen that.
I know of a black-market parts
dealer in Paris, a treacherous
lowlife. But, he's the only car in
the world who can tell us whose
engine this is. Mater, what would
you say to setting up an informal
task force on this one?

NAME: MATER
Wait, what?

NAME: FINN
You obviously have plenty of
experience in the field.

NAME: MATER
Well yeah I live right next to one.
I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly
been much help to anybody recently.

NAME: FINN
You're helping me. Please, Mater.

NAME: MATER
Well, okay. But you know I'm just a
tow truck, right?

NAME: FINN
Right. And I'm just in the
import/export business. Siddeley?

NAME: SIDDELEY
Yes, Finn?

NAME: FINN
Paris. Tout de suite.

NAME: MATER
Yeah, two of them sweets for me
too, Sid!
You know, I always wanted to be a
spy.

NAME: SIDDELEY
Afterburners, sir?

NAME: FINN
Is there any other way?

NAME: HOLLEY
No VIN scans. Got it.

NAME: FINN
Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at
anyone. And absolutely, positively
no idling. Are we clear?

NAME: HOLLEY
Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.

NAME: FINN
Mater?

NAME: MATER
Yeah, Finn?

NAME: FINN
We're not here to go shopping.

NAME: MATER
Shopping? What do you mean? Why
would I ---

NAME: MATER
Dadgum.

NAME: MERCHANTS
- Parts for sale, Monsieur!
- Monsieur! Parts for sale!

NAME: MATER
You gotta be kidding me - they've
got everything here. Look at them
hoods! I could use a hood.

NAME: MATER
Sorry fellers, I gotta go.

NAME: MATER
Excuse me. What are you selling?

NAME: FINN
There you are.

NAME: MATER
Man, there are some great ---

NAME: FINN
Mater, get back!

NAME: MATER
Hey, wait for me!

NAME: HOLLEY
But I thought ---

NAME: FINN
Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
him up.

NAME: MATER
Sure thing.

NAME: TOMBER
You rusty piece of junk, get your
dirty hook off me!

NAME: FINN
Allez! Maintenant - vite!

NAME: FINN
Easy, Tomber. This is her first
field assignment - she didn't know
you were my informant.

NAME: HOLLEY
Informant?

NAME: TOMBER
A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
smell.

NAME: FINN
Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
Moroccan impound the first time I
saved him, if I recall correctly.

NAME: TOMBER
Speaking of recalls, you're getting
up there in mileage aren't you,
Finn?

NAME: HOLLEY
Alright, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old. So.

NAME: HOLLEY
There you go, informant. Inform us.

NAME: TOMBER
That is the worst motor ever made.

NAME: TOMBER
Wait. That oil filter... those
wheel bearings.

NAME: FINN
Do those parts look familiar,
Tomber?

NAME: TOMBER
They should. I sold them.

NAME: HOLLEY
To whom?

NAME: TOMBER
No idea. He's my best customer, but
he always does his business over
the phone. I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts. Now I
know.

NAME: MATER
Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
nothing truer than that.

NAME: FINN
"Lemon?"

NAME: MATER
Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
ever work right. Lemons is a tow
truck's bread and butter. Like them
Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
the party and the race and the
airport.

NAME: FINN
Holley, pull up the pictures from
the oil platform. I want to know
what other type of cars were out
there.

NAME: HOLLEY
Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
And Trunkovs.

NAME: FINN
Mater, are these cars considered
lemons?

NAME: MATER
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

NAME: HOLLEY
Finn. Everyone involved in this
plot is one of history's biggest
loser cars.

NAME: FINN
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

NAME: TOMBER
This explains it!

NAME: FINN
What, Tomber?

NAME: TOMBER
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
never get together. But they're
having a secret meeting in two
days.

NAME: FINN
Where's this meeting taking place?

NAME: TOMBER
Porto Corsa, Italy.

NAME: MATER
That's where the next race is!

NAME: FINN
Then there's a good chance our
mystery engine will be there too.

NAME: TOMBER
Your chances are more than good. I
just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday... to Porto Corsa.

NAME: FINN
Holley, contact Stephenson and have
him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good
work.

NAME: MATER
You never see this many lemons in
one town. Unless there's a swap
meet, or something.

NAME: MATER (CONT'D)
Hey, how'd you get all them
pictures?

NAME: HOLLEY
Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto
Corsa's red light cameras to do
recognition scans.

NAME: MATER
Wow, not only is you the prettiest
car I ever met, but you the
smartest too.

NAME: HOLLEY
Thank you. I think.

NAME: MATER
That's a familiar sight.

NAME: MATER
A Hugo being towed. But he looks
absolutely perfect.

NAME: FINN
Of course. They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

NAME: MATER
Makes sense. If I was rich and
broke down every day, I'd hire me
to tow me around all the time too.

NAME: FINN
We've got to infiltrate that
meeting. It's the only way to find
out who's behind all this.

NAME: MATER
What?

NAME: HOLLEY
Hold still.

NAME: MATER
Ahh!

NAME: FINN
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

NAME: HOLLEY
Thank you, Finn.

NAME: MATER
Boy, I sure wish my friends could
see me now.

NAME: LUIGI
Guido, your eyes do not deceive
you. We are in Italy. We are home!

NAME: FILLMORE
Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel,
man?

NAME: LUIGI
What? No friends of mine will stay
in a hotel in my village. You will
stay with my --- Uncle Topolino!

NAME: SARGE
How do they do it? These are the
same ingredients as back home, but
it tastes so good.

NAME: FILLMORE
It's organic, man.

NAME: SARGE
Tree hugger.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
You look so down, so low. Is like
you have flat tires.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
She said you look like you're
starving. That she's going to make
you a big meal, and fatten you up.

NAME: MCQUEEN
No, Mama Topolino, please. You
don't need to make a fuss!

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
Capisco. I understand. Is a
problem, yes? Between you and a
friend?

NAME: MCQUEEN
How'd you know that?

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
A wise car hears one word and
understands two.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
That, and Luigi told me. While Mama
cooks, come and take a stroll with
me.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I brought my friend Mater along on
the trip. And I told him he needed
to act different, that we weren't
in Radiator Springs.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
This Mater. He's a close friend?

NAME: MCQUEEN
He's my best friend.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

NAME: MCQUEEN
What did I do? I said some things
during our fight...

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me, they would
fight over everything.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
They fight over what Ferrari was
the best Ferrari; which one of
them look more like a Ferrari...
There were even some non-Ferrari
fights.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
to fight. Everybody fights now and
then, especially best friends.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
But you gotta make up fast.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
No fight more important than
friendship.

NAME: UNCLE TOPOLINO
Chi trova un'amico, trova un
tesoro.

NAME: MCQUEEN
What does that mean?

NAME: MAMA TOPOLINO
Now, mangia! Eat!

NAME: STEPHENSON
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

NAME: FINN
Thank you, Stephenson.

NAME: HOLLEY
That should just about do it.

NAME: FINN
Perfect.

NAME: HOLLEY
So Mater, it's voice-activated. But
you know, everything's voice-
activated these days.

NAME: MATER
What? I thought you was supposed to
be making me a disguise.

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Voice recognized. Disguise Program
Initiated.

NAME: MATER
Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a
German truck!

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: MATER
Check it out. I'm wearing
Materhosen. Make me a monster
truck!

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: MATER
A funny car!

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: FINN
The idea is to keep a low profile,
Mater.

NAME: MATER
So I just go in, pretend to be this
truck.

NAME: FINN
And leave the rest to us.

NAME: HOLLEY
Now hold still.

NAME: HOLLEY
I have to do the final fitting on
your disguise.

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh dear. That's no good.

NAME: MATER
Hey, what are you doing?

NAME: HOLLEY
The disguise won't calibrate
effectively without a smooth
surface to graft onto.

NAME: MATER
Oh. For a second there I thought
you was trying to fix my dents.

NAME: HOLLEY
I was.

NAME: MATER
Well then no thank you. I don't get
them dents buffed, pulled, filled
or painted by nobody. They're way
too valuable.

NAME: HOLLEY
Your dents are valuable?

NAME: MATER
I come by each one of them with my
best friend Lightning McQueen.

NAME: MATER (CONT'D)
I don't fix these. I want to
remember these dents forever.

NAME: HOLLEY
So you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your
cover?

NAME: FINN
Friendships can be dangerous in our
line of work, Mater.

NAME: MATER
But my line of work is towing and
salvage.

NAME: FINN
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is
designing iPhone apps.

NAME: MATER
No, I meant for real. I ---

NAME: HOLLEY
It's okay. Say no more. I'll work
around the dent.

NAME: FINN
In the meantime...

NAME: FINN
You look a little light on weapons.

NAME: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
The big news continues to be
Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to
the press earlier today to answer
questions about its safety.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
An independent panel of scientists
has determined that Allinol is
completely safe. Okay? Safe! There
it is.

NAME: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
So the race will go on, folks.

NAME: DARRELL CARTRIP
But the question everyone is
asking: Will the real Lightning
McQueen show up today?

NAME: FRANCESCO
Bellissima! Thank you for your
support.
And your big mistake, McQueen!

NAME: LUIGI
McQueen? Is everything okay?

NAME: FILLMORE
If you're worried about your fuel,
man, don't. It's perfectly safe.

NAME: MCQUEEN
No, guys, I just really wish Mater
were here.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Oh, great. Here it comes. What've
you got, Francesco?

NAME: FRANCESCO
For famous race cars like Francesco
and well... you, to be far away
from home is not easy.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I think you forgot the insulting
part of that insult.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Is no insult. When Francesco is
away from home, he misses his mama
just like you miss your tow truck
amico.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because
that's exactly how I ---

NAME: FRANCESCO
Of course, I am at home. And my
mama is right here.

NAME: FRANCESCO (CONT'D)
McQueen is very sad! I will beat
his cry-baby bottom today!

NAME: MCQUEEN
And there's the insult we were
missing. Grazie!

NAME: ALEXANDER HUGO
Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly
cars. Look like someone stole their
trunks.

NAME: HOLLEY
Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!

NAME: HOLLEY
Mio nonno, my grandfather, has
broken down. If one of you would
help I would be so thankful.

NAME: IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
Sounds like you need some "roadside
assistance".

NAME: ANOTHER HUGO
She was talking to me, Ivan.

NAME: IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
Oh really? Prove it.

NAME: HOLLEY
No, no, don't fight over me.

NAME: HOLLEY
Signore Tow Truck, per favore?

NAME: FINN
You're on any moment now.

NAME: MATER
I don't know about this, Finn.
What if I screw things up?

NAME: MATER
It's just that them guys look
pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
say "idiot"? Is that how you see
me?

NAME: HOLLEY
Why aren't you in disguise?

NAME: MATER
I, uh---

NAME: HOLLEY
Come on, there's no time. Go!

NAME: MATER
Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: ALEXANDER HUGO
It's the boss! He is coming!

NAME: VICTOR HUGO
Ivan!

NAME: VICTOR HUGO
Ivan, why do you insult me so by
making me wait?

NAME: HOLLEY
He's in.

NAME: CIGARETTE GIRL CAR
Air Freshener, antenna balls,
sparkplugs...

NAME: MATER
Why is that? What do you mean don't
talk to you?
(more talking from Holley
which we cannot hear)
So you want me to stop talking to
you. Right now?

NAME: ALEXANDER HUGO
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

NAME: MATER
I have no idea what you're talking
about...

NAME: MATER
...Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop
Alex."

NAME: MATER
Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But I guess that makes sense
seeings how you's wanted in France,
Germany, the Czech Republic...

NAME: HOLLEY
NAME: DISPLAY)
(cutting in to his
Mater! Stop it!

NAME: ALEXANDER HUGO
Okay, okay. Keep your voice down.
You're gonna make me arrested.
Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in
a bad mood.

NAME: FINN
He's so good.

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Victor!

NAME: TUBBS PACER
Hey, Victor!

NAME: J. CURBY GREMLIN
There you are.

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Come in, come in.

NAME: J. CURBY GREMLIN
Victor Hugo. I'm J. Curby Gremlin,
from Detroit. It's good to see you.
Now we can start.

NAME: VICTOR HUGO
Is the big boss here yet?

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
No, not yet.

NAME: TUBBS PACER
He's supposed to be here any
minute.

NAME: FINN
Here we go.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Guten Tag!

NAME: TUBBS PACER
It's just the Professor.

NAME: VICTOR HUGO
Zundapp, when is he coming?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
He's already here.

NAME: VOICE
Welcome, everyone.

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
I wish I could be with you on this
very special day but... my clutch
assembly broke. You know how it is.

NAME: TUBBS PACER
Been there.

NAME: J. CURBY GREMLIN
Forget about it.

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
We know how you feel.

NAME: FINN
Descramble that voice!

NAME: HOLLEY
I'm trying... It's too
sophisticated!

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
We are here to celebrate. Today all
your hard work pays off. The world
turned their backs on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts. The only
thing they haven't stopped doing is
laughing at us. They've called us
terrible names...

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
Jalopy. Rustbucket.

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
Heap. Clunker.

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
Junker, beater, wreck.

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
Rattletrap.

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
Lemon. But their insults just give
us strength. Because today, my
friends...

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
...that all ends.

NAME: FINN
What just happened?

NAME: HOLLEY
I'm working on it.

NAME: ENGINE VOICE
They laughed at us. But now it's
our turn to laugh back.

NAME: FINN
Holley?

NAME: HOLLEY
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

NAME: HOLLEY
Finn, it's the camera!

Where?

On the tower.

And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve, will
become the most powerful cars in
the world!

Get out of the way! Andate!

They will come to us and they will
have no choice, `cause they will
need us.

NAME: FINN
No!

Long live Lemons!

Finn.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yeah!

NAME: FRANCESCO
Dah! This is impossible!

NAME: MCQUEEN
That's what I'm talking about.
Kachow! Hey, where are all the
other cars?

NAME: FRANCESCO
What is going on?

NAME: BRENT MUSTANGBURGER
Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in
London still going to take place?

NAME: J. CURBY GREMLIN
I can't believe this is really
happening.

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Shh, quiet!

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Here it comes.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
A toast! To the death of Allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

NAME: HOLLEY
Mater. Abort the mission. They've
got Finn. Get out of there. Get out
of there right now!

NAME: IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
How is your grandfather?

NAME: ALEXANDER HUGO
Isn't this a great party, Ivan?

NAME: MATER
Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.

NAME: ALEXANDER HUGO
You are not leaving, are you?

NAME: MATER
Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.

NAME: MATER
McQueen?

NAME: LEMONHEADS
- What?! - Did he just say
Allinol? After today?

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Yes, sir. Of course.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed.

NAME: MATER
No!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
It's the American spy!

Right this way, signore.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater?

That really sounded like Mater.
Mater?

NAME: MATER
McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater?!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Excuse me.

NAME: PRESS LIAISON
No, no, where are you going?
Please, Mr. McQueen!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Scusi. Mater! Scusi...

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
so sorr ---

NAME: IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.

NAME: IVAN THE TOW TRUCK
Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
killed out there today." You're
the best.

NAME: MCQUEEN
What? Oh. I mean, thanks.

NAME: PRESS LIAISON
Right this way, signore ---

NAME: MCQUEEN
I really thought I heard my friend.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Wait, what?

NAME: PRESS LIAISON
Please, the world press is waiting.
You come with me, please.

NAME: MATER
Let me go!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
You actually care about that race
car. A pity you didn't warn him in
time.

NAME: MATER
Domo arigato!

NAME: MATER
You done good! You got all the
leaves!

NAME: JEFF GORVETTE
Check out that tow truck.

NAME: LEWIS HAMILTON
I wonder who that guy's with?

NAME: MATER
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

NAME: MATER
I never leak oil. Never.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene!

NAME: MATER
Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
up, did I?

NAME: MCQUEEN
I lost the race because of you!

NAME: MATER
Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---

NAME: MCQUEEN
I don't need your help. I don't
want your help!

NAME: MATER
Bang a gong, get it on!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Listen, this isn't Radiator
Springs. This is exactly why I
don't bring you along to these
things!

NAME: MATER
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

NAME: FINN
We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
Bentley.

NAME: MATER
Woaaaah! ---

NAME: MATER
This... this is all my fault.

NAME: FINN
Don't be a fool, Mater.

NAME: MATER
But I am, remember? You said so.

NAME: FINN
When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
complimenting you on what a good
spy you are.

NAME: MATER
I'm not a spy!

NAME: MATER
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time. I really am just a
tow truck.

NAME: HOLLEY
Finn, he's not joking.

NAME: FINN
I know.

NAME: MATER
You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen is
`cause I'm such a big one. This is
all my fault.

NAME: GREM
Good, you're up!

NAME: ACER
And just in time!

NAME: GREM
Professor Z wanted you to have a
front row seat for the death of
Lightning McQueen.

NAME: ACER
Not for much longer.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I called to talk to Mater. It never
occurred to me that he wouldn't be
there.

NAME: RAMONE
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard
right now.

NAME: FLO
And Sarge is in touch with his
friends in the British military.

NAME: SALLY
You just need to focus on the race.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I know, but Sal, with everything
going on I'm not sure I should---

NAME: MCQUEEN
Sir Axlerod.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
I'm sorry to interrupt.

NAME: MCQUEEN
No, no, it's all right.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
I just wanted to come down here and
personally thank you. Because after
Italy, I was finished. And then you
gave me one last shot.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Listen, I ---

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
And I probably shouldn't be saying
this at all but... I hope you win
today. Show the world that they've
been wrong about Allinol.

NAME: SALLY
Mater would want you to race.

NAME: MCQUEEN
All right. For Mater.

NAME: GREM
Here he comes!

NAME: GREM
I don't know, Professor.

NAME: ACER
What did you do?

NAME: ACER
You broke it.

NAME: GREM
Quiet!
I understand, sir. Yes.

NAME: ACER
What'd he say?

NAME: GREM
We go to the backup plan.

NAME: MATER
Backup plan??

NAME: GREM
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!

NAME: ACER
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow," he's
gonna go "ka-boom"!

NAME: GREM
Don't feel bad, tow truck. You
couldn't have saved him.

NAME: ACER
Oh, wait. You could have!

NAME: MATER
Dadgum lemons.

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: GREM
What, you didn't think we'd take
your bullets?

NAME: ACER
That's right! You got nothin'.

NAME: GREM
Who's the lemon now, huh?

NAME: FINN
Nice try, Mater.

NAME: MATER
Dadgum!

NAME: MATER
Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!

NAME: HOLLEY
Mater!

NAME: MATER
I gotta get you all out of there!

NAME: FINN
There's no time. McQueen needs your
help, Mater.

NAME: MATER
But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.

NAME: FINN
It's up to you. Go to the pits and
get everyone out. You can do that.

NAME: MATER
What about you guys?

NAME: FINN
We'll be okay.

NAME: HOLLEY
Go and get some more dents, Mater.

NAME: HOLLEY
So we'll be "okay"? Really?

NAME: FINN
He wouldn't have left if I'd told
him the truth.
Being killed by a clock. Gives a
whole new meaning to "your time has
come."

NAME: HOLLEY
Time. That's it!

NAME: FINN
What are you doing?

NAME: HOLLEY
Trying to turn back time. If I can
just reverse the polarity...

NAME: FINN
Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!

NAME: MATER
What's everybody on the wrong side
of the road for?!

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh no!

NAME: FINN
Drive!

NAME: FINN
Burn rubber!!

NAME: FINN
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to ---

NAME: HOLLEY
Done.

NAME: HOLLEY
They're standard issue now.

NAME: FINN
You kids get all the good hardware.

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh no. That's Mater's.

NAME: FINN
I knew his escape was too easy.

NAME: LUIGI
Mater!

NAME: MATER
Everybody get out! Get out now!
Y'all gotta get out the pits!

NAME: MATER
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

NAME: SALLY
We're here because of you, Mater.

NAME: FLO
Is everything okay?

NAME: MATER
No! Everything's not okay! There's
a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get
out! Now!

NAME: EVERYONE
- A bomb? - Huh? - Woah.

NAME: FINN
Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on
you.

NAME: FINN
They knew you'd try to help
McQueen. When we were knocked out
they planted it in your air filter.

NAME: MATER
Uh-oh.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater! There you are!

NAME: MATER
Stop right there!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Oh man, I've been so worried about
you!

NAME: MATER
Don't come any closer!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Are you okay?

NAME: MATER
No, I'm not okay. Stay away from
me!!

NAME: MCQUEEN
No, wait. Wait!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, wait!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, wait!

NAME: MATER
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you gonna get hurt real bad!

NAME: MCQUEEN
I know I made you feel that way
before, but none of that matters
because we're best friends!

NAME: MATER
McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the
bomb!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here.
You've always been the bomb! And
you'll always be the bomb.

NAME: MATER
Stay away!

NAME: MCQUEEN
No! Never!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Almost there...

NAME: MCQUEEN
I'm not...letting you...

NAME: MCQUEEN
...get away again!

Oh my gosh!

The Professor's on the run.

Someone's gotta get McQueen.

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
Get McQueen!!

NAME: FINN
Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help
Mater.

NAME: HOLLEY
Got it!

NAME: FRANCESCO
What is happening?!

NAME: COMBAT SHIP
Hurry, Professor!

NAME: FINN
Do you really think I'm going to
let you float away, Professor?

NAME: MATER
McQueen, let go!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Never!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Give it up, McMissile!

NAME: HOLLEY
Mater, stop!

NAME: MATER
No way! You could get hurt!

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh no.

NAME: HOLLEY
Mater, we've got to get that bomb
off you.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Bomb?

NAME: MATER
Yeah, they strapped it to me to
kill you as a back-up plan.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb
on you?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Death ray?

NAME: FINN
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Are you all so dense? It's voice-
activated. Everything is voice-
activated these days.

NAME: MATER
Deactivate! Deactivate!

NAME: BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
Voice denied.

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Oops. Did I forget to mention that
it can only be disarmed by the one
who activated it?

NAME: HOLLEY
Say it!

NAME: PROFESSOR ZUNDAPP
Deactivate.

NAME: BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
Voice denied.

NAME: HOLLEY
He was getting on my nerves.

NAME: MCQUEEN
What do we do?

NAME: VICTOR HUGO
You blow up.

NAME: VLADIMIR TRUNKOV
It's nothing personal.

NAME: MATER
Fellers, listen.

NAME: MATER (CONT'D)
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me my
whole life too ---

NAME: MATER
--- but becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams ain't
gonna make you feel better.

NAME: J. CURBY GREMLIN
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

NAME: GUIDO
Pit stop.

NAME: SHERIFF
Not today, boys!

NAME: TUBBS PACER
Retreat!

NAME: SARGE
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

NAME: BRITISH CORPORAL
Anything for one of pop's mates.

NAME: MCQUEEN
What's he saying?! What's wrong!?

NAME: LUIGI
None of his wrenches fit the bolts!

NAME: MATER
I get it. I get it! I know what
needs to be done.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Then do it!

NAME: MATER
What? No, I can't do it. Look,
nobody takes me seriously. I know
that now. This ain't Radiator
Springs.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yes it is.

NAME: MCQUEEN
You're yourself in Radiator
Springs. Be yourself here. And if
people aren't taking you seriously,
then they need to change. Not you.
I know that, because I was wrong
before. Now you can do this. You're
the bomb.

NAME: MATER
Thanks, buddy.

NAME: MCQUEEN
No no no, you're the actual bomb.
Now let's go!

NAME: MATER
Oh, right! Hang on!

NAME: FINN
Where's he going?

NAME: MATER
Computer!

NAME: MATER'S COMPUTER
Yes, Agent Mater.

NAME: MATER
I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

Now I need you to do the chute, the
second kind not the first!

Who's winning the race?

NAME: QUEEN'S GUARD
Back up! Back away!

NAME: QUEEN'S GUARDS
Get back!

NAME: MCQUEEN
No, no, it's okay! Tell them,
Mater. Explain.

NAME: MATER
Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging
the racers and hurting the cars and
I know who. Oh wait... Your
Majesty.

NAME: QUEEN'S GUARDS
- Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody
down! - Look out!

NAME: FINN
Mater, I don't know what you're
doing but stand down now!

NAME: MATER
This ain't nothing at all like
Radiator Springs.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, just cut to the chase!

NAME: MATER
Okay.

NAME: MATER
It's him.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

NAME: MATER
I figured it out when I realized
you all attached this ticking time
bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
bolts that hold together that old
British engine from the photograph.
Holley! Show that picture.

NAME: HOLLEY
O-kay...

NAME: MATER
And then I remembered what they say
about old British engines - "If
there ain't no oil under `em, there
ain't no oil in `em."

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
What is he talking about?

NAME: MATER
It was you leaking oil at the party
in Japan. You just blamed it on me.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Electric cars don't use oil, you
twit.

NAME: MATER
Then you're faking it. You didn't
convert to no electric. We pop that
hood we gonna see that engine from
that picture right there.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
This lorry's crazy. He's going to
kill us all!

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Stay away!

NAME: HOLLEY
But Sir Axlerod created the race,
Mater. Why would he want to hurt
anyone?

NAME: MATER
To make Allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil. I
mean, he said it himself with that
disguised voice.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
"Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you
are!

NAME: PRINCE WHEELIAM
This is going nowhere fast. We
really should go, Grandmother.

NAME: QUEEN
One moment. I'd like to see where
this is going.

NAME: FINN
Mater, he created Allinol.

NAME: MATER
Yeah, but what if he found that
huge oil field just as the world
was trying to find something else?

NAME: MATER
What if he came up with Allinol
just to make alternative fuel look
bad?

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
"What if?" You're basing this on a
"What if"?!

NAME: GUARD
Okay, that's it.

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
crazy!

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Keep away, you idiot!

NAME: FINN
Mater!

NAME: HOLLEY
Mater!

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
Someone do something!

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
You're insane, you are!
Deactivate!!

NAME: THE BOMB'S COMPUTER VOICE
Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
Sir Axlerod.

NAME: FINN
The engine from the photo.

NAME: HOLLEY
It's a perfect match!

NAME: MILES AXLEROD
How did the tow truck figure it
out?

NAME: MATER
Now you're talking!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater, let's go. You're on.

NAME: LORD STEWARD
Your Majesty. May I present for the
investiture of honorary Knighthood
of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
Radiator Springs.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Go get `em, buddy.

NAME: QUEEN
I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."

NAME: MATER (CONT'D)
McMissile, McQueen. Queen?
McMissile.

NAME: MATER
So there I was: rocket jets going
full blast, McQueen hanging on for
dear life when suddenly them two
nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
guns drawed. We was goners. But
then out of nowhere, this beautiful
spy car swoops in from the sky to
save us!

NAME: MINNY
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

NAME: VAN
Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
spy cars?

NAME: HOLLEY
No, you're quite right. It does
sound a bit far-fetched.

NAME: MATER
Holley! Finn!

NAME: HOLLEY
Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see
you again.

NAME: MATER
What're you doing here?

NAME: FINN
Our satellites picked up an urgent
communique.

NAME: LUIGI
So you got my e-mail.

NAME: MATER
Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a
great time. Everybody! This here's
Finn McMissile. He's a secret
agent.
Don't tell nobody. And this is
Holley Shiftwell. She's ---

NAME: HOLLEY
I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so
nice to meet you all.

NAME: VAN
Was that from when you swooped in
and saved them in London?

NAME: MINNY
Van!

NAME: VAN
What? I'm just asking.

NAME: RAMONE
Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just
let me go get my tools.

NAME: HOLLEY
Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

NAME: LIZZIE
A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as
crazy as Mater.

NAME: MACK
Those two are perfect for each
other.

NAME: MCQUEEN
You know, there's one thing I still
don't get. The bad guys hit me with
the beam from the camera, right? So
why didn't I, you know...

NAME: MATER
Explode in a fiery inferno?

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yeah.

NAME: FINN
We couldn't figure that one out
either.

NAME: HOLLEY
Our investigation proved that
Allinol was actually gasoline. And
Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
when it got hit by the beam it
would explode.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
my fuel was safe.

NAME: FILLMORE
If you're implying that I switched
out that rotgut excuse for
alternative fuel with my all-
natural, sustainable, organic
biofuel just because I never
trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong,
man.
It was him.

NAME: SARGE
Once Big Oil, always Big Oil. Man.

NAME: FILLMORE
Tree hugger.

NAME: SHERIFF
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is
about to begin! All spectators
clear the starting line!

NAME: LEWIS HAMILTON
Man, I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked.

NAME: JEFF GORVETTE
Yeah, we should do this every year.

NAME: MCQUEEN
I just figured, we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.
Plus: no press, no trophy. Just
racing - the way I like it.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Francesco likes it like this too.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Francesco. I'd like you to meet ---

NAME: FRANCESCO
Signorina Sally. It is official:
Lightning McQueen is the luckiest
car in the world.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Which he will have to be to have a
chance against Francesco today.

NAME: FRANCESCO
See you at the finish line, Mc---

NAME: FRANCESCO
What is that?

NAME: MCQUEEN
It's just something I had made up
for the occasion.

NAME: FRANCESCO
Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
was funnier when I did it, but
it's very funny. What are you going
to do next? Are you going to take
off your fenders? Try it. You'll
like it.

NAME: SALLY
So he's not so good-looking.

NAME: MCQUEEN
Yeah. Nice try.

NAME: SALLY
I'm serious.

NAME: MCQUEEN
That's why I love you, Sally.
Wish me luck.

NAME: SALLY
You don't need it!

NAME: FLO
Mmm-mmm. That Francesco is fine-
looking.

NAME: SALLY
And those open wheels.

NAME: FLO
I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

NAME: MATER
Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!

NAME: HOLLEY
Finn, time to go. Siddeley's
gassed, geared and ready to fly.

NAME: MATER
You're leaving already?

NAME: FINN
We've got another mission, Mater.
Just stopped by here to "pick
something up."

NAME: MATER
Something tells me you're not
talking about souvenir bumper
stickers.

NAME: FINN
Her Majesty asked for you
personally, Mater.

NAME: MATER
But I told you all before. I'm not
a spy.

NAME: HOLLEY
We know.

NAME: FINN
Spy or not, you're still the
smartest, most honest chap we've
ever met.

NAME: HOLLEY
Don't forget massively charming.

NAME: MATER
Well, thanks. But as much fun as it
was hanging with y'all, this...

NAME: MATER
This is home.

NAME: HOLLEY
That's alright, we understand. But
I'll be back. You still owe me that
first date.

NAME: FINN
If there's ever anything I can do
for you, just let me know.

NAME: MATER
Well, I sure appreciate that, thank
you.
Actually... there is one thing.

NAME: MATER
Whoo-hoo!!!

NAME: OTIS
Whoa!!!

NAME: FRANCESCO
Impossible!

NAME: MCQUEEN
Mater!?

NAME: MCQUEEN
I'll see you at the finish line,
buddy!

NAME: MATER
Not if I see you first!

NAME: SILAS
Three weeks and we're still no
closer to cracking this?

NAME: SILAS (CONT'D)
Right... bring him in.

NAME: AGNES

princess!

Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

sleep at night, you crusher of
little girls' dreams!!!

Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
coming?

Any minute now!

Yayyy!

Stall them.

Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
That's enough of the magic show!

NAME: MINIONS
Awwww.

NAME: MARGO
Wait, did you hear that? It
sounded like the twinkling sounds
of magical fairy dust.

NAME: AGNES
It's the fairy princess!   She's
coming!

NAME: MARGO
Look!

NAME: GRU
Aaaaaahh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
most magical fairy princess of all!
And I am here to wish Princess
Agnes a very happy birthday!

NAME: LITTLE GIRL
How come you're tho fat?

NAME: GRU
Because my house is made of candy
and sometimes I eat instead of
facing my problems.

NAME: LITTLE GIRL
How come you have-

NAME: GRU
Okay!   Time for cake!

NAME: AGNES
Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
the best fairy princess ever!

NAME: GRU
You are welcome, little girl.

NAME: AGNES
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
just pretending for the other kids.

NAME: JILLIAN
Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
Party!

NAME: GRU
Hello, Jillian.

NAME: JILLIAN
Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
here, but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and...

NAME: GRU
No, no, no, get off of the limb
right now. No limb.

NAME: JILLIAN
Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
sings karaoke, she has a lot of
free time, looks aren't that
important to her...

NAME: GRU
No, Jill's, that is not happening.
Seriously. I'm fine.

NAME: JILLIAN
Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
about my cousin Linda?

NAME: GRU
No.

NAME: JILLIAN
Oh, oh! I know someone whose
husband just died!

NAME: GRU
I'm sorry.     I did not see you
there.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Or there.

NAME: GRU
Kyle... Kyle!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
business on the petunias!

There you go. Those are Fred's.
Go crazy.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Good boy.

NAME: GRU
Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

NAME: LUCY
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
(realizes her badge is
upside down)
Oh. Whoops.
(clears her throat, all
business)
Sorry, you're gonna have to come
with me.

NAME: GRU
Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!

NAME: LUCY
You know you really should announce
your weapons after you fire them,
Mr. Gru. For example--

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
good.

NAME: LUCY
Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Oh...sorry!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Get...in...there...you...big...man!

NAME: TOM AND STUART
Boss!

NAME: TOM
Koom ey lah!

NAME: STUART
Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

NAME: STUART (CONT'D)
Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

NAME: STUART (CONT'D)
Woooo!

NAME: TOM
Ooooh!

NAME: STUART
Quack quack!

NAME: TOM AND STUART
Hi-YAH!!

NAME: CONFUSED FISHERMAN
What the--     Oh!

NAME: MINIONS
Whoa...

NAME: GRU
Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh,
foot's asleep...ah...pins and
needles...

NAME: GRU
Ehhh...

NAME: SILAS
I apologize for our methods in
getting you here.

NAME: LUCY
I don't. I'd do it again in a
heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I
enjoyed that. Every second of it.
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

NAME: SILAS
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

NAME: LUCY
Sorry, sir.

NAME: GRU
Okay, this is bogus!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
I don't know who you people think
you are, but--

NAME: SILAS
We are the Anti-Villain League.

NAME: SILAS (CONT'D)
An ultra-secret organization
dedicated to fighting crime on a
global scale. Rob a bank? We're
not interested. Kill someone? Not
our deal. But you want to melt the
polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt.
Fuji? Or even steal the moon?
Then we notice.

NAME: GRU
First of all, you've got no proof
that I did that. Second, after I
did do that, I put it back!

NAME: SILAS
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
That's why we've brought you here.
I am the League's director, Silas
Ramsbottom.

NAME: TOM
Bottom.

NAME: TOM AND STUART
Heeheheeeeheeehee.

NAME: SILAS
Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...

NAME: LUCY
Oh, me now...?

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Um, recently an entire top secret
lab disappeared from the Arctic
Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.
Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where
did it go?

NAME: GRU
I don't care.

NAME: LUCY
The lab was devoted to experiments
involving PX-41, a transmutation
serum. What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

NAME: TOM AND STUART
Aaah!

NAME: GRU
Oh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Hmm, you usually don't see that in
bunnies.

NAME: SILAS
As you can see, in the wrong hands,
the PX-41 serum could be the most
devastating weapon on earth.
(struggles to get through
the opening in the table)
Fortunately it has a very distinct
chemical footprint, and using the
latest chemtracking technology, we
found traces of it in the Paradise
Mall.

NAME: GRU
Ha!   A mall?

NAME: SILAS
Precisely. And we believe that one
of these shop owners is a master
criminal.

NAME: SILAS (CONT'D)
And that's where you come in. As
an ex-villain, you know how a
villain thinks, how a villain acts.

NAME: LUCY
The plan is to set you up
undercover at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully you'll be able to--

NAME: GRU
Okay, I see where this is going,
with all the Mission Impossible
stuff, but no. No! I am a father
now. And a legitimate businessman.
I am developing a line of delicious
jams and jellies.

NAME: SILAS
Jams and...jellies?

NAME: GRU
Oh, attitude! That's right! So
thanks, but no thanks.
And here's a tip--instead of tasing
people and kidnapping them, maybe
you should just give them a call!
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

NAME: SILAS
Ramsbottom.

NAME: GRU
Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

NAME: LUCY
Look, I probably shouldn't be
saying this, but your work as a
villain was kind of amazing, so if
you ever want to get back to doing
something awesome--give us a call.

NAME: TOM
Mack-oh! Mack-oh!    Mack-oh!

NAME: GRU
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.

NAME: MARGO
Oh, sorry.

NAME: EDITH
So when ya goin' on your date?

NAME: GRU
What?

NAME: EDITH
Remember? Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

NAME: GRU
Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And
I'm not going on any date.

NAME: EDITH
Why not?    Are you scared?

NAME: LISA
Hey, did you guys see the moon
landing on TV?

NAME: GIRLS
Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so
cool...

NAME: LISA
Yeah, and you know what--

NAME: LITTLE GRU
Excuse me, Lisa?

NAME: LISA
I was talking to Billy the other
day.

NAME: GIRLS
No way.

NAME: LISA
He is so cute.

NAME: LISA (CONT'D)
And I think he likes me.

NAME: GRU
Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--

NAME: GIRL
Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru
touched Lisa!

NAME: GIRLS
Eeeeewww!

NAME: RED HAIRED GIRL
Lisa's got Grooties!

NAME: GRU
Scared? Of what? Women?! No,
that's bonkers! I just-- I have no
interest in going on a date, that's
all. Case closed. I'm not scared--
of women... or dates... let's go to
bed.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Goodnight, Edith.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Goodnight, Margo.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold
the horses. Who are you texting?

NAME: MARGO
No one.   Just my friend Avery.

NAME: GRU
Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's
name or a boy's name?

NAME: MARGO
Does it matter?

NAME: GRU
No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless
it's a boy!

NAME: AGNES
I know what makes you a boy.

NAME: GRU
Uh...oooh...you...do?

NAME: AGNES
Your bald head.

NAME: GRU
Oh, yes...

NAME: AGNES
It's really smooth. Sometimes I
stare at it and imagine a little
chick popping out. Peep peep peep.

NAME: GRU
Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

NAME: SUPERVISOR MINION
Hey, oh!    Me banana!

NAME: GRU
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's
almost Friday.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
So, how's today's batch, Dr.
Nefario?

NAME: DR.    NEFARIO
I developed a    new formula which
allowed me to    get every known kind
of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

NAME: GRU
That tastes good...
Love the flavor of that...

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
It's horrible, isn't it?

NAME: GRU
No! No! Oh, we're making great
progress!
Here, try some of this.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Whoa... okay, just because
everybody hates it doesn't mean
it's not good.

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Listen, Gru. There's something
I've been meaning to talk to you
about for some time now.

NAME: GRU
What?   What's wrong?

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
I miss being evil. Sinister plots,
large-scale crimes...It's what I
live for! I mean, don't you think
there's more to our future than
jelly?

NAME: GRU
Well, I'm also considering a line
of jams...

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Um...the thing is, Gru...
I've had an offer of employment
elsewhere.

NAME: GRU
Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're
kidding, right?

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
It's a great opportunity for me,
bigger lab, more evil, full
dental...

NAME: GRU
Very well. Let us give you the
proper send-off.
Minions!

NAME: GRU
The highest honor awarded. To Dr.
Nefario for your years of service.
The twenty-one fart gun salute!

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Uh, I counted twenty-two.

NAME: DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
Farewell, my friends.

NAME: DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
This may take a while. Go about
your business.

NAME: DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
I miss you already!

NAME: FRENCH MAID MINION
Hello?

NAME: AGNES
Are you sure we should be doing
this?

NAME: MARGO
Yes, it's for his own good.

NAME: MARGO (CONT'D)
Okay, we need to choose a picture.

NAME: AGNES
No.

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
Scary.

NAME: EDITH
Weird.

NAME: GIRLS
Aaaaaah!!!

NAME: AGNES
What is that?!

NAME: GRU
Good morning, girls! I have an
announcement to make.

NAME: MARGO
Hey, what celebrity do you look
like?

NAME: GRU
Ummm...Bruce Willis.

NAME: MARGO
Mmmm...no.

NAME: AGNES
Humpty Dumpty!

NAME: EDITH
Ooh, Gollum!

NAME: GRU
Okay, what are you doing?

NAME: AGNES
We're signing you up for online
dating!

NAME: GRU
Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

NAME: EDITH
Aw come on, it's fun.

NAME: MARGO
And it's time for you to get out
there.

NAME: GRU
No! Stop!      No one is ever getting
out there!     Ever!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Okay, now for the announcement:    I
have accepted a new job.

NAME: MARGO
Whoa--really?

NAME: GRU
Yes, I have been recruited by a top
secret agency to go undercover and
save the world!

NAME: EDITH
You're gonna be a spy?!

NAME: GRU
That's right, baby! Gru's back in
the game! With gadgets and weapons
and cool cars...the whole deal.

NAME: EDITH
Awesome!

NAME: AGNES
Are you really gonna save the
world?

NAME: GRU
Yes.   Yes I am.

NAME: DAVE
Mocha!

NAME: KEVIN
Cacao!

NAME: STUART
Papadam?

NAME: GRU
Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.

NAME: GRU
Alright, here is the cupcake recipe
I got off the internet.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
And don't go nuts with the
sprinkles!

NAME: LUCY
Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-
ay-ay-ay!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Whoo. Wasn't expecting that.
(strikes a martial arts
pose)
Or was I?

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Ooh... you got... You got... a
little...

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Oh, that's just spreading...um...

NAME: GRU
Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got
it!... Stop it!

NAME: LUCY
Oh!     I'll let you get it.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Yeah, what you just saw there was a
little something new I've been
working on. It's a combination of
Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare,
and krumping.

NAME: GRU
Okay, that's weird--why are you
here?

NAME: LUCY
On assignment from Silas.   I'm your
new partner. Yay!

NAME: GRU
What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom
didn't say anything about a
partner.

NAME: LUCY
Well, seems that because of your
checkered past, everyone else
refused to work with you. But not
me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so
I kind of have to do what they tell
me anyway.

NAME: DAVE
Walla!

NAME: LUCY
You know this guy?

NAME: GRU
Yes, he's one of my minions.

NAME: LUCY
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have
known.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
You're free to go.

NAME: GRU
Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.

NAME: LUCY
First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft,
proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral
Shop.

NAME: GRU
No.    Not her.

NAME: LUCY
Okay, moving on...

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-A-
Bear."

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Ooh.

NAME: GRU
I don't think so.

NAME: GRU
Oh!

NAME: EDUARDO
Buenos dias, my friends! I am
Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa &
Salsa Restaurant, across the mall.
Now open for breakfast. And you
are?

NAME: GRU
Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are
closed.

NAME: EDUARDO
This is just gonna take un momento.
I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo
party, and I am going to need two
hundred of your best cupcakes
decorated with the Mexican flag.
It looks something like this.

NAME: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
What do you think?

NAME: GRU
Look away!

NAME: LUCY
You-- Whoa... Hooo...

NAME: EDUARDO
Anyway, I have to go. It's all
settled! I pick `em up next week!
Have a good day. Come by if you
get a chance, okay?

NAME: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
And welcome to the mall family!

NAME: GRU
El Macho.

NAME: LUCY
What?

NAME: GRU
But it couldn't be...

NAME: LUCY
Wha-- What? What couldn't be??

NAME: GRU
That guy looks exactly like a
villain named El Macho. From about
twenty years ago.

NAME: LUCY
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty
dead...

NAME: GRU
They never found the body. Oh no.
All that was ever retrieved was a
pile of singed chest hair.
But... that face. It has got to be
El Macho.

NAME: LUCY
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant?
Tonight.

NAME: GRU
Yes, that's good, because I'm
telling you--if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum...

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
...it's him.

NAME: GRU
Alright, alright, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for
bed.

NAME: MARGO
What's the big hurry?

NAME: GRU
I just... I have a lot of work to
do.

NAME: EDITH
Work, what kind of work?

NAME: GRU
Very important business.
So...hugs, kisses...
...good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah-
blah--

NAME: AGNES
But you said you'd help me
practice my part for the Mother's
Day show!

NAME: GRU
Fine, fine... Let me hear it.
Quickly.

NAME: AGNES
She kisses my boo-boos
She braids my hair
My mother is beyond compare
We love you, mothers, everywhere!

NAME: GRU
Wow! That was...something else. I
really liked the way you smiled at
the end. Let's try this one more
time, but a teensy bit less like a
zombie, okay?

NAME: AGNES
Okay.
She kisses my boo-boos
She braids my hair--

NAME: GRU
Perfect!   Time to go!

NAME: AGNES
I don't think I should do this.

NAME: GRU
Well, what do you mean?    Why not?

NAME: AGNES
I don't even have a mom.

NAME: GRU
Well, you don't need one to do the
show. I mean, you did the Veterans
Day Pageant and you haven't been in
combat.

NAME: AGNES
This is different.

NAME: GRU
Okay, well, then...maybe you can
just use your imagination.

NAME: AGNES
You mean I pretend I have a mom?

NAME: GRU
Yes, right. You can do that, can't
you?

NAME: AGNES
Yeah! I do that all the time!
Thanks, Gru!

NAME: MINIONS
Hey!

NAME: GRU
Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no,
no! Hey, please!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for
me, okay?
Dave, Stuart--come this way. With
me! Come on!

NAME: GRU (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Come on!

NAME: KEVIN
Hey, putt-putt?

NAME: JERRY
Oh!

NAME: KEVIN
Una, doo--
(laughs as he lowers the
golf club to Jerry's
head)

NAME: KEVIN
Boca!

NAME: JERRY
Boca!

NAME: KEVIN
Looka too!

NAME: GRU
We're stealth ninjas.    We make no
sound.

NAME: LUCY
Right.   Gotcha.

NAME: GRU
Alright, El Macho, you're going
down.

NAME: LUCY
Wait!    Wait!

NAME: GRU
What?

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
What are you doing?

NAME: LUCY
I'm checking for laser beam alarm
triggers.

NAME: GRU
It's a restaurant!

NAME: LUCY
You never know what kind of booby
traps this guy could have set.
Huh? C'mon!

NAME: GRU
There are no booby traps!

NAME: LUCY
Ha!   Booby!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Oh. There's a chicken. Are you
lost little guy? You must be lost!

NAME: GRU
Ha!   Some guard dog.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Get it off of me! Get it off of
me! Get it off of me!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
I got you!

NAME: LUCY
I got it!     Ha!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Ha!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Oh!

NAME: GRU
Ugh...

NAME: LUCY
What is wrong with that chicken?
Hey, that pollo? Es loco.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
No? Okay, let's go.

NAME: GRU
You getting anything?

NAME: LUCY
No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you
can find something with these x-ray
goggles.

NAME: GRU
Bah...

NAME: GRU
Ahh!   Ooof!

NAME: LUCY
What's wrong? Something wrong?

NAME: GRU
Oh, that's an image I'll never get
out of my brain. Blagh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
I knew it!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
The serum is in here!

NAME: LUCY
Ooh, then let's get it!

NAME: GRU
Oh, this is going to be good!
Ahh...

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
A-ha!
(registering it's not the
serum)
What? It's... salsa?

NAME: LUCY
Awww man.

NAME: EDUARDO
Oh... somebody's going to die
tonight.

NAME: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
Pollito!

NAME: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
What'd they do to you? Pollito?
Can you hear me?

NAME: POLLITO
Boc!

NAME: EDUARDO
Who would do this to such a sweet
little chicken? What? Who's
there?

NAME: EDUARDO
You coming out?! Or am I gonna go
in?!

NAME: EDUARDO
Stop!

NAME: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
My eyes!

NAME: LUCY
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

NAME: GRU
We've been spotted!    Come get us!

NAME: DAVE
Huh?
Hey!     Loo-koo-meow-plah!

NAME: STUART
Ah!    Koom-kwat!

NAME: LUCY
Hm.   Subtle.

NAME: GRU
Over here, over here!    Over...
here.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Hold tight!

NAME: EDUARDO
I have you now!

NAME: DAVE
Rawr, rawr!

NAME: STUART
Oh!   Oh!   Gelato!

NAME: MINIONS
Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato!

NAME: STUART
Stopa!    Stopa!!

NAME: STUART (CONT'D)
Hey-ho! Gelato!

NAME: GRU
Oh.    Okay.

NAME: LUCY
See if you can get closer.
Go...go.

NAME: GRU
Alright, what do--

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oh no. That's not good.

NAME: GRU
Oh! Girls! What are you doing
here?

NAME: MARGO
Well, we thought we'd come visit
you at work.
(looks at Gru and the
trash can)
So, you're saving the world in a
garbage can?

NAME: GRU
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny.

NAME: LUCY
Hey, there you are.   Oh, who's
this?

NAME: GRU
Lucy, these are my girls, Margo,
Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy.
Lucy, girls.

NAME: MARGO
Hello.

NAME: EDITH
Hi.

NAME: AGNES
Are you single?

NAME: LUCY
Oh!   Goodness...

NAME: GRU
Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since
Lucy and I have lots of work to do,
why don't you girls go and explore
the mall!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Here is some money. Go buy some
useless mall junk! Some headbands,
and--

NAME: AGNES
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

NAME: GRU
Are you out of your gourd?    No!
She just works with me.

NAME: AGNES
Plus you love her.
You love her, you love her, you
really really love her, and you're
gonna get married, and I will be
the flower girl, and--

NAME: GRU
Okay, stop! That is a song of
lies. I don't even like her!
Now go have fun!

NAME: AGNES
Almost forgot! Hugs!

NAME: MARGO
Good luck saving the world.   Bye!

NAME: AGNES
Bye, Gru!

NAME: GRU
Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right?
They're...funny.

NAME: LUCY
Those girls totally adore you.       I
bet you're a fun dad.

NAME: GRU
Huh.
I am pretty fun.

NAME: AGNES
Is that stealing?

NAME: EDITH
Not if my wish was that I would get
a lot of free coins.

NAME: MARGO
Whoa!

NAME: ANTONIO
Cool glasses.

NAME: ANTONIO (CONT'D)
I'm Antonio.

NAME: MARGO
I'm...Margo.

NAME: ANTONIO
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

NAME: MARGO
Uh, sure.    I'm...Margo.

NAME: MARGO (CONT'D)
Um...I'll catch up with you guys
later. Bye!

NAME: EDITH
Can I be the first to say...Ewwww!

NAME: AGNES
We gotta go tell Gru!

NAME: GRU
All right, I'm going in.

NAME: LUCY
--will make a sound like this-- MEE-

NAME: GRU
Okay! I get it!     I get it!

NAME: FLOYD (CONT'D)
It's about time you showed up...Mr.
Gru.

NAME: GRU
You...know my name?

NAME: FLOYD
When someone moves into the mall
who is follically challenged, I
make it my business to know all
about them. You are bald. And
that is bad.

NAME: FLOYD (CONT'D)
There you go, my sweet.

NAME: LUCY
I'm getting nothing so far. I
think you need to move around.

NAME: GRU
Wow, this looks interesting.     What
is it?

NAME: FLOYD
I take it you're an art lover?

NAME: GRU
Yeah, not so much.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oh, how about this impressive
trinket?

NAME: FLOYD
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr.
Gru.

NAME: LUCY
Nothing.

NAME: FLOYD
The International--

NAME: GRU
Yeah, I don't care.

NAME: LUCY
MEE-MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! Hold on.
I'm picking up something! Behind
that wall!

NAME: GRU
Ah!    And what do we have here?

NAME: FLOYD
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

NAME: GRU
No thanks. So what's on the other
side of the wall?

NAME: FLOYD
Here you are! Look at me!     Focus!

NAME: LUCY
Gru?

NAME: FLOYD
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly to
irresistible.

NAME: GRU
Date??? Boyfriend???
What???

NAME: AGNES
There she goes!

NAME: MARGO
Oh, you're so funny...

NAME: EDITH
Gross!    Look, they're in love!

NAME: GRU
Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that
they are...no no no, no!

NAME: MARGO
Wow.    You're so complicated.

NAME: GRU
Margo.    What is going on here?

NAME: MARGO
Oh! Gru, se llama Antonio.       Me
llamo Margo.

NAME: GRU
Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares.
Let's go.

NAME: MARGO
Whoa!

NAME: EDUARDO
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

NAME: GIRLS
Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome!

NAME: EDUARDO
So good to see you again, mi
compadre!

NAME: ANTONIO
Oh, I see you have already met my
father.

NAME: GRU
What the-- Father?!

NAME: EDUARDO
Si! Look at this crazy small world
we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me
get you something.

NAME: GRU
Oh... look at you.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Haha. He likes me!

NAME: EDUARDO
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is
usually very friendly.
He had a rough night.

NAME: GRU
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

NAME: EDUARDO
That is a pity. Young love is
beautiful, no?

NAME: GRU
No!
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other!

NAME: EDUARDO
You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!
They must get to know each other
better. Antonio, why don't you
invite your girlfriend and her
family to our Cinco de Mayo party?

NAME: GRU
No, no, I am--

NAME: GIRLS
Si!

NAME: SILAS
I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we
eliminated him as a suspect? After
the whole salsa incident?

NAME: GRU
Yes, but there has been a new
development, and I'm telling you,
this is the guy. You need to
arrest him immediately. And his
deviously charming son. I'm pretty
sure that the son is involved, too.
The son also. You've got to get
the son.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
I think that the son is the
mastermind. There's a look.
There's a devilish look in his eyes
and I don't like it!

NAME: SILAS
Yes, but I don't really see any
evidence for--

NAME: GRU
Evidence schmevidence! I go with
my gut, and my gut tells me that
this guy is El Macho! Lock him up!
Lock up the son. Don't forget
about the son. The kid gives me
the creeps!

NAME: SILAS
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...

NAME: LUCY
Uh, but, on the less...
..."crazy" side of things, uh, Gru
discovered traces of the serum at
Eagle Hair Club.

NAME: SILAS
Hm...    Interesting...

NAME: LUCY
Yeah, and you know who made that
happen? Huh?
This guy. Nailed it. Amazing,
right?

NAME: GRU
No. I mean, sure, but it's not
him. It is...
...El Macho.

NAME: SILAS
Mr. Gru.     Please--

NAME: GRU
No.   It is him!   And I will prove
it!

NAME: LUCY
Gru, c'mon!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
He really thinks it's El Macho.
Can you tell?

NAME: POPSICLE MINION
Koonga!

NAME: GRU
Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Hey, Lance! Where the heck is
Kevin?

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Alright, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys
get. I can't find anybody anymore!

NAME: JILLIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
I've got good news!

NAME: JILLIAN
I have my friend Shannon here with
me! I was thinking you two could
get some grub, you know, tear it
up! See what happens!

NAME: GRU
Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm
not here!

NAME: AGNES
Gru's not here!

NAME: JILLIAN
Are you sure?

NAME: AGNES
Yes!   He just told me!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
I mean no, he didn't just tell me!

NAME: JILLIAN
Agnes--where is Gru?

NAME: AGNES
He's putting on lipstick!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
He's swatting at flies!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
He's...chopping his head off!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
He's...pooping?

NAME: SHANNON
I have to tell you, I was so
nervous about tonight. I mean
there's just so many phonies out
there!

NAME: GRU
Yes, I hear you.

NAME: SHANNON
Oh, so do you work out?

NAME: GRU
Well...

NAME: SHANNON
I mean, obviously, you don't, but
would you consider it? Huh?

NAME: SHANNON (CONT'D)
Physical fitness is very important
to Shannon. As you can tell,
right? Huh?

NAME: GRU
Ah.   I can tell.

NAME: SHANNON
Solid.

NAME: GRU
We are in a restaurant, you know.

NAME: LUCY
Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?

NAME: HOSTESS
Sure, just a sec.

NAME: SHANNON
Your accent is so exotic.

NAME: GRU
Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I
was--

NAME: SHANNON
I know someone who can fix that for
you. And you'll be talking normal
in no time.

NAME: GRU
Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here?
Oof. How's the food?

NAME: SHANNON
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are
you wearing a wig?

NAME: GRU
What? Ah!
I don't think so.

NAME: SHANNON
I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate
phonies.

NAME: GRU
Oh. What? No.      These locks are
all mine...

NAME: SHANNON
No they're not! You know what I'm
gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing
off your head and show everyone
what a bald-headed phony you are.

NAME: LUCY
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

NAME: GRU
Hello... Hello, are you...?

NAME: GRU
Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...?

NAME: LUCY
Wow, looks like your date's out for
the count. It's like she's been
shot with a mild moose
tranquilizer.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what
actually happened.

NAME: ITALIAN WAITER
`Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She
no like?

NAME: LUCY
Oh, she's just uh--

NAME: ITALIAN WAITER
Oh, oh, si, si...

NAME: LUCY
Shall we take her home?

NAME: LUCY
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

NAME: GRU
Huh, tell me about it.

NAME: LUCY
Don't worry--it can only get better
from here, right? But if it
doesn't, you can always borrow my
dart gun. I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

NAME: GRU
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
I think I'm good with just the one.

NAME: LUCY
Well, good night, partner.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
This was fun.

NAME: GRU
Yes.   Surprisingly, it was.

NAME: LUCY
Oh, and uh, just between you and
me? You look much better bald.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
See you tomorrow!

NAME: GRU
Quack!     Quack!    Quack!

NAME: AGNES
Yeah!

NAME: MARGO
So I take it the date went well?

NAME: GRU
No!   It was horrible!

NAME: GRU
High-five!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Bump it.

NAME: GRU
Mr. Ramsbottom?

NAME: SILAS
Oh, hello.

NAME: GRU
What are you doing here?

NAME: SILAS
We got him.

NAME: GRU
Got who?

NAME: SILAS
Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located
a secret room in his shop last
night, and uh, discovered this!

NAME: SILAS (CONT'D)
It's empty, but we found traces of
the PX-41 serum in it. He's our
man. So somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

NAME: FLOYD
I was framed! You won't get away
with this! Get your mitts off of
me! I am a legitimate businessman!

NAME: GRU
Ah.   Alright. So...what now?

NAME: SILAS
Well, now you're free to go back to
your "business." Mmmm. Jams and
jellies. And it looks like Agent
Wilde will be transferring to our
Australian branch.

NAME: GRU
Australia...?

NAME: SILAS
Yes. But thank you--for
everything. And by everything of
course I mean...nothing.
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

NAME: LUCY
Hey there.

NAME: GRU
Hey.

NAME: LUCY
So...we got him.

NAME: GRU
Yay.  That's great.
And now you're going to Australia?

NAME: LUCY
Well, it's not definite yet. Still
figuring it out. Already been
working on my accent.
Wallaby. Diggeri-doo. Hugh
Jackman.
So...um. Pretty excited...

NAME: GRU
Great.   Well...good luck.

NAME: LUCY
Thanks. You too.
Oh. Here. I wanted to give you
this.

NAME: GRU
Your lipstick taser?

NAME: LUCY
Yeah, it's just a memento. Just,
you know, from the first time we
met.

NAME: GRU
Oh.    Thank you, Lucy.

NAME: GRU
Well... it looks like they need
you, so...

NAME: LUCY
Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.

NAME: AGNES
I brought you an umbrella.

NAME: GRU
Ah, thank you.

NAME: AGNES
What're you doing out here?

NAME: GRU
Remember when you said that I liked
Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're
right.

NAME: AGNES
Really?

NAME: GRU
Yes, but...well, she's moving away.
I'm never going to see her again.

NAME: AGNES
Is there anything I can do to help?

NAME: GRU
Oh, I don't--I don't think so,
sweetheart.

NAME: AGNES
Well, is there anything you could
do?

NAME: GRU
"Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know
up to this point our relationship
has been strictly professional, and
you're leaving for Australia and
all, but..."
Okay, here is the question. "Would
you like to--to go out on a date?"

NAME: DAVE
Eh, no.

NAME: GRU
Okay, that's not helping.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
All right.     Here we go.   For real
this time.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
I can do this.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Agh!    I hate you!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Ah.

NAME: SIREN MINION
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

NAME: SIREN MINION (CONT'D)
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

NAME: SIREN MINION (CONT'D)
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo!

NAME: KEVIN
Tom?

NAME: KEVIN & FRENCH MAID MINION
Bello!   Compai!

NAME: FRENCH MAID MINION
Compai!

NAME: PURPLE FRENCH MAID MINION
Blaaah!

NAME: KEVIN
Oh...

NAME: MARGO, EDITH & AGNES
Cinco de May-yay-yo! Cinco de May-
yay-yo! Cinco de May-yay-yo!

NAME: EDITH
Whoa!   This place is awesome!

NAME: GRU
Okay. Let's party. Ah? But first
let's go over the rules. Because
what is fun without the rules?

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Agnes, easy on the churros.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Edith, try not to kill anyone.

NAME: EDITH
Hai!

NAME: GRU
Margo--

NAME: ANTONIO
Hello, Mr. Gru.

NAME: GRU
Aghhh!    Okay...

NAME: MARGO
Gru!

NAME: GRU
There must be the standard six feet
of space between you and boys.
Especially this boy.

NAME: ANTONIO
You are a funny man. There are no
rules, Seor! It's Cinco De Mayo!
Come on! They're starting the
dance!

NAME: AGNES
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba!

NAME: EDUARDO (CONT'D)
(sensing something's
wrong)
Hey, what's wrong?

NAME: GRU
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
I'm just chilling with the
guac...from my chip hat.

NAME: EDUARDO
Gru, please. I know that look all
too well. It is the look of a
broken heart.

NAME: GRU
How did you know?

NAME: EDUARDO
Believe me, my friend, I too have
spent many nights trying to drown
my sorrows in guacamole.

NAME: GRU
You?

NAME: EL MACHO
Yes. But we are survivors.
There's much more to us than meets
the eye. Enjoy the party.

NAME: GRU
What the--oh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Huh.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oooh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Aaaahhh...

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Aaaahhh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oooohhh.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Aha!    Ha ha ha--

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oh!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Ouch!

NAME: LUCY
Say what?

NAME: FEMALE GRU PASSENGER
Ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good
joke.

NAME: GRU BABY
I just did a boom boom.

NAME: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I really need you to make a choice,
hon.

NAME: LUCY
I choose Gru.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

NAME: FLIGHT ATTENDANT
You're welcome!

NAME: GRU
Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El
Macho!

NAME: EL MACHO
That's right!

NAME: GRU
Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I
knew you weren't dead!

NAME: EL MACHO
Of course not. I merely faked my
death, ha, ha!
But now it's time for me to make a
spectacular return to evil!
Doctor, I think it's time we showed
Gru what we're up to here.

NAME: GRU
Dr. Nefario?

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Nice to see you, Gru.

NAME: GRU
Whaaat? This-- So, this is your
new job opportunity?

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Absolutely. You're gonna like
this.

NAME: EL MACHO
Sorry--I had to borrow some of your
minions, but it was for a worthy
cause.

NAME: GRU
Oh!   Kevin? Agh!

NAME: EL MACHO
No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he
is an indestructible, mindless
killing machine!

NAME: KEVIN
Blah!

NAME: EL MACHO
Just watch this!

NAME: EL MACHO (CONT'D)
And here's the best part! I've got
an ARMY OF THEM!

NAME: EL MACHO (CONT'D)
Soon I will unleash them on the
world--and if anyone, anyone,
tries to stop them...YEOW! Their
city gets eaten!
We can do it together!

NAME: GRU
Together?

NAME: EL MACHO
Together! I have admired your work
for years, amigo. Stealing the
moon?! Are you kidding?! We would
be unstoppable! Men like you, men
like me, we should be ruling the
world!
So, are you in?

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Woo-hoo!

NAME: GRU
Uh...yeah...probably...

NAME: EL MACHO
Probably?

NAME: GRU
I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes,
I just have a lot going on right
now...I just need to get some
things off my plate before we start
taking over the world, that's all.

NAME: EL MACHO
`Scuse me?

NAME: GRU
No--no, forget it! One hundred
percent! I am in!
(pretending to hear
something)
I think--what is--do you hear that--
I do. That's Agnes calling me from
on the surf--

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Totally in!

NAME: EL MACHO
You know what? I am not so
convinced that he is in.

NAME: KEVIN
Blah!

NAME: GRU
Edith!   Agnes!      Come on!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Ooof!

NAME: EDITH
Sorry.

NAME: GRU
We need to go home now!    Where's
Margo?

NAME: AGNES
But I didn't get a turn!

NAME: GRU
Margo!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Come on, we're leav--hey, what's
wrong?

NAME: MARGO
I hate boys.

NAME: GRU
Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey,
we've got to go.

NAME: LUCY
Oops, sorry!

NAME: LUCY
Oh, hey!   Eduardo!

NAME: EL MACHO
Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's
usually not like this. The same
thing happened the other day
with... with Gru and...

NAME: LUCY
Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you
seen him? I really need to talk to
him.

NAME: EL MACHO
Yes, I think he's somewhere around
here. You two are close, no?

NAME: LUCY
Oh, I don't know. I mean close...
I wouldn't say we were close. Why,
did he say we were close? Did he
say that?

NAME: EL MACHO
It's more what he didn't say. For
instance, he never mentioned...that
you were both working for the Anti-
Villain League!!!

NAME: EL MACHO (CONT'D)
You're coming with me.

NAME: LUCY
Hey!

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Crikey.

NAME: EDITH
So Eduardo's actually El Macho?
Cool!

NAME: GRU
No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty
much knew it was him all along, so
if anyone's cool, it's me.

NAME: GRU
Well, Dr. Nefario...

NAME: GRU
Lucy? Wha--that's impossible!
She's on her way to Australia...

NAME: AGNES
He's got Lucy?

NAME: GRU
Not for long.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Come on.
We're getting her out of there.

NAME: AGNES
What was that?

NAME: MARGO
I don't see anything.

NAME: MARGO (CONT'D)
Run!

NAME: AGNES
My unicorn!

NAME: MARGO
Agnes, no!

NAME: MARGO
C'mon!   Hurry!

NAME: AGNES
Whoa!

NAME: EDITH
What's the matter?

NAME: AGNES
Whoa!

NAME: KEVIN
Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos?

NAME: AGNES
Kevin!

NAME: MARGO
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
In the flesh.

NAME: DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
Behold, the antidote!

NAME: DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D)
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

NAME: GRU
Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused
here!

NAME: MINIONS
Okay, okay.

NAME: GRU
Curses. Foiled again. These guys
captured me.

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Run!

NAME: GRU
Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Hello, Gru!

NAME: GRU
Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
I put an antidote in the jelly.
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil
army to destroy the world, but
nobody messes with my family.

NAME: GRU
Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go
get the--

NAME: AGNES
Hi!

NAME: GRU
You brought the girls?

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Yes!
Oh.     Was that wrong?

NAME: EDITH
Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!

NAME: EL MACHO
Oh no! What's happening to my
minions?
Gru?

NAME: GRU
You guys take care of the rest of
the minions.
I'm going to find Lucy.

NAME: AGNES
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
Waaaaah!

NAME: GRU
It's over, El Macho.   Now where is
Lucy?

NAME: EL MACHO
Let me show you.

NAME: LUCY
Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were
right about the whole El Macho
thing, huh?
Yay!

NAME: EL MACHO
One push of this button and I send
that rocket straight into the same
volcano where I faked my death.
Only this time--it's for real!

NAME: GRU
No!

NAME: DAVE
Tally ho!

NAME: EL MACHO
We could've ruled the world
together, Gru. But now--you're
gonna die.

NAME: GRU
Lipstick taser!

NAME: LUCY
Aw...he copied me.

NAME: EL MACHO
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

NAME: DR. NEFARIO
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun,
sunshine.

NAME: LUCY
Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be
fine. I have survived lots worse
than this.
Okay, that's not entirely true.
I'm actually kind of freaking out
up here!

NAME: GRU
Don't worry--I will get you out of
this!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
I really hate that chicken.

NAME: LUCY
Is there a red one?   It's usually
the red one.

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Gru, anytime now!

NAME: GRU
Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of
this alive, so I need to ask you a
question.

NAME: LUCY
Uh, better make it quick!

NAME: GRU
If I'd asked you out on a date,
what would you have said?

NAME: LUCY
Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oh!  Lucy!
Lucy! Where are you?!

NAME: GRU (CONT'D)
Oh, Lucy!

NAME: LUCY
Gru!

NAME: LUCY (CONT'D)
Sorry...I guess you kind of need
your arms to tread water, huh?

NAME: TOM
Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

NAME: GRU
They'll be back...

NAME: EDITH
Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

NAME: AGNES
Okay.

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
Excuse me!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
Um...hi!   Excuse me!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to
make some toast. Uh...

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.
She braids my hair.
We love you mothers, everywhere!

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
And my new mom Lucy is beyond
compare.

NAME: AGNES (CONT'D)
To the bride and Gru!

NAME: EVIL MINION
Blaaaaah!

NAME: UBERMAN
You look so peaceful from up here.

NAME: UBERMAN (CONT'D)
Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
again.

NAME: EINSTEIN
NAME: 3.
I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
it: we're all supposed to be
"masterminds" - very clever.
I just feel stupid. I mean, what
the hell did Einstein really do
anyway?

NAME: PLATO
Theory of relativity.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Well, you'd think he'd invent a
wool sweater that didn't itch so
much.

NAME: MASTER MIND
The real Einstein once said, "God
does not play dice with the world."
He was right, because the world is
MY dice. Is that understood?

NAME: DA VINCI & PLATO
Sir! Yes, sir!

NAME: EINSTEIN
Yes, sir.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
have the girl?

NAME: DA VINCI
Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
just like you knew she would.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Reporters are a curious lot, and
easily manipulated.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Alright, let's not keep the lady
waiting.

NAME: ROXANNE
You didn't need to turn around like
that. I can recognize the stench of
failure.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I trust you gentlemen know the very
sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly
regarded investigative journalist
who some say has a more than
friendly relationship with our
super powered foe Uberman. And Miss
Ritchi, I trust you've already met
my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!

NAME: ROXANNE
Looks like a real group of winners.
At the risk of sounding cliche',
you'll never get away with this.

NAME: MASTER MIND
In a way, I already have.

NAME: ROXANNE
We go through this every time. You
kidnap me to get to Uberman, he
immediately finds your hideout,
escapes whatever lame trap you've
come up with, and takes you and
your cronies to jail. I propose we
just save everybody some heartache
this time by YOU letting me go, and
ME forgetting this whole thing ever
happened?

NAME: MASTER MIND
What about my revenge?

NAME: ROXANNE
We can say it was wasting
everyone's time.

NAME: MASTER MIND
You have a wicked tongue. I hope
you rid yourself of that when
you're my queen.

NAME: ROXANNE
I'm sorry. What makes you think I
would want to be your queen?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Power corrupts absolutely, Miss
Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
power over this city, I have
absolutely every intention of
corrupting you with it.

NAME: PLATO
Sir!

NAME: MASTER MIND
What is it!?

NAME: UBERMAN
Master Mind!

NAME: UBERMAN
What's the matter, miss your old
jail cell?

NAME: UBERMAN
You can't possibly believe this
will work.

NAME: PLATO
We're now at minimum safe distance,
master.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Excellent. Stop here, I like this
view.

NAME: PLATO
Twenty seconds until impact.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Any last words?

NAME: PLATO
Ten seconds to impact.

NAME: PLATO (CONT'D)
Nine...

NAME: PLATO (CONT'D)
Eight...

NAME: MASTER MIND
What's going on?

NAME: UBERMAN
Hold...on...a second.

NAME: PLATO
Seven...

NAME: DA VINCI
What did he just say?

NAME: PLATO
Six......Five...

NAME: MASTER MIND
What kind of trick is this?

NAME: UBERMAN
Like you don't know. These bars are
made of copper, aren't they?

NAME: PLATO
Four...

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yeah, so?

NAME: UBERMAN
You figured out my weakness, damn
you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!

NAME: PLATO
Three...

NAME: MASTER MIND
Your weakness is copper?

NAME: PLATO
Two...one.

NAME: PLATO
I don't think even he could have
survived that.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Whoa! Is it me or did you just
finally destroy Uberman?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Well...let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

NAME: DA VINCI
Look, there's something in the sky,
coming this way.

NAME: ROXANNE
Uberman!

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
NAME: ROXANNE
Uberman?

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
You killed him!

NAME: EINSTEIN
You did it!

NAME: MASTER MIND
...so I did.

NAME: EINSTEIN
I mean, I know you always wanted
to. I mean, all the schemes all the
plots - I never thought you'd
actually be capable of it.

NAME: EINSTEIN
This is history. Every villain and
lackey in the history of villains
and lackeys dream of this moment,
but when does it actually EVER
happen?

NAME: EINSTEIN
Good lord...You do all realize what
we get to do now, don't you?

NAME: EINSTEIN
We get to go on a crime wave.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh, right.

NAME: HAL
It's a sport of honor, focus and
grace. Honor the ball, focus on the
pins, release the ball not hard and
fast, but as if you were releasing
a baby dove.

NAME: HAL
Okay, do something like that - but
center it more.

NAME: ATTRACTIVE BLOND
Tell me how my form looks, honey.

NAME: HAL
Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'
REAL good.

NAME: VINNIE
Now!

NAME: VINNIE
You're fired. Leave your shirt and
locker key.

NAME: HAL
Fired? Are you going to tell me
why?

NAME: VINNIE
Showing up to work late. Showing up
to work late drunk. Sexually
harassing customers. Stealing from
the register.

NAME: HAL
Vinnie, I don't know where you're
getting these accusations -

NAME: HAL
Oh, which one do you supposedly
have here?

NAME: VINNIE
This is all of them at once.

NAME: HAL
I've got this one, Benny. So,
Cinderella. Can I help you find
your glass slipper?

NAME: WOMAN
Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.

NAME: HAL
Seven - Well, maybe I could
interest you in something in an
EIGHT. Namely, me.

NAME: HAL
Lesbo.

NAME: HAL
From the angle of the camera, I can
see where you might have gotten the
wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't
think you've thought this through.
If you fire me, who's gonna be
captain of the alley's bowling
team?

NAME: VINNIE
Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody
who can actually bowl. You guys
have never won a game. I hired you
because you said you were on the
pro circuit.

NAME: HAL
No, I said I WILL BE on the pro
circuit.

NAME: VINNIE
Please, a loser like you will never
amount to anything.

NAME: HAL
Wow...If that's how you feel...I
guess we should then talk about
what kind of severance I'm gonna
get.

NAME: HAL
Hey...what about my ball?

NAME: HAL
Thank-you!

NAME: ROXANNE
It's...um...It's good to be back.
Thanks for everyone's cards and
concerns. I really appreciated it -
now I'm ready to climb back on the
horse.

NAME: FRANK
Someone die or something?

NAME: FRANK
Oh, Jesus.

NAME: ROXANNE
It's okay.

NAME: FRANK
Come on into my office, sweetie.

NAME: FRANK
Can we get this woman some water
for God's sake?
I gave you two months off. What're
you doing back? People are gonna
think I'm a slave driver.

NAME: ROXANNE
Aren't you?

NAME: FRANK
Yeah, but I don't want people to
think it.

NAME: ROXANNE
Frank, listen. I want to go back to
work. I NEED to go back to work.

NAME: FRANK
...You're hysterical, aren't you?

NAME: ROXANNE
What're you doing?

NAME: FRANK
Keeping you warm before you go into
shock.

NAME: ROXANNE
It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
everyone knows Uberman and me
were...close. But what I really
need - what would really make me
better is getting back to work.

NAME: FRANK
Well, that's going to be...

NAME: ROXANNE
I thought you'd be happy to have me
back.

NAME: FRANK
Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us
happier than to have our girl back,
but...

NAME: ROXANNE
Yes?

NAME: FRANK
Things have sorta...changed.

NAME: ROXANNE
In three weeks?

NAME: FRANK
Listen, I'm not one who likes to
open up wounds - especially ones
that are just starting to scab, but
you were sorta our go to girl for
the exclusive on Uberman. And now
that he's gone...I moved Brad into
your anchor spot.

NAME: ROXANNE
Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an
idiot.

NAME: FRANK
It's the suits. They think it's
time to switch things up.

NAME: ROXANNE
Oh, because they can't use me to
get the big story.

NAME: FRANK
C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the
nature of what we do. They used
you, you used Uberman. Everybody's
happy.

NAME: ROXANNE
I didn't use him.

NAME: FRANK
Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you
two were in love or something. My
bad.

NAME: ROXANNE
We were.

NAME: FRANK
And that's great.

NAME: ROXANNE
Very in love.

NAME: ROXANNE
Okay. So, where are they going to
move me if Brad has my spot?

NAME: FRANK
...Human interest.

NAME: ROXANNE
Bake sales and pet stories.

NAME: FRANK
I told them I wouldn't be surprised
if you just upped and quit. You
busted your ass for that desk.

NAME: ROXANNE
I'll take it.

NAME: FRANK
What?

NAME: EINSTEIN
Just robbed the diamond exchange.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Great, great. Put it on the pile.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Anything else today?

NAME: MASTER MIND
No.

NAME: PLATO
Sir, the new reactor is installed.

NAME: PLATO
Do you want to throw the switch? I
know how you love to start
reactors.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Maybe later.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
What is it, Plato?

NAME: PLATO
Sir, I can't help but notice that
you've been...a little down lately.

NAME: MASTER MIND
When I want your opinion I'll beat
it out of you.

NAME: PLATO
Yes, sir, I know, but please
forgive my impertinence. It's just
that you seem to have lost your
lust for our profession. You've
stopped going on jobs and spend
most of your time watching Uberman
specials.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I have defeated my greatest enemy.
I have free reign over Metro City.
I have more wealth than a thousand
Sultans. I've achieved all I have
worked for...so why am I so
unhappy?

NAME: MASTER MIND
NAME: 23.
I mean, my father, god rest his
evil and tormented soul, raised me
straight from the test tube to be a
symbol of evil.
And, I have accomplished something
he had only dreamed about - the
destruction of Metro City's
champion. I tell you, I've always
lived with this unquenchable
thirst. I thought it was to make
him proud or to get absolute power.
But now that I've pretty much
accomplished both, I am at a loss.

NAME: PLATO
...I sort of have a theory about
all that.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh, really?

NAME: PLATO
Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman
was more important to you than you
thought.

NAME: MASTER MIND
He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I
wonder, did he consider me his evil
equal or was I just an annoying,
little gnat to him? ...What's the
second part?

NAME: PLATO
I think you sort of have a thing
for Roxanne Ritchi.

NAME: PLATO
Sir, your plans always involve Ms.
Ritchi either being kidnapped or
placed in danger. If that's not
love, I don't know what is. It's
the grown up equivalent of dipping
her pigtails in the ink well. Don't
you see? She's the one treasure
that's always escaped you.

NAME: ROXANNE
I just wanted to get back to work.

NAME: ROXANNE
I keep trying to tell people it
wasn't really like that. Uberman
and I - We were kinda having
problems. We broke up.

NAME: ROXANNE
Maybe someone who's a little more
aware of his faults. Someone a
little more sensitive.

NAME: ROXANNE
Well, until he miraculously comes
walking into my life, I'm just
going to take a little reflection
time for myself.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Who the hell is John Cusack?

NAME: POLITICIAN
The Fifth Avenue Renovation
Project, which I championed, will
breath new life into the downtown
area. New life means new jobs and
new revenue.

NAME: ROXANNE
Councilman, is it true that your
brother-in-law's construction
company won the contract for this
project?

NAME: POLITICIAN
Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not
here to answer a lot of crazy
questions...

NAME: YOUNG MOTHER
Thank you! Thank you for saving me
and my baby!

NAME: HAL
(not knowing what she's
talking about)
Huh?

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
There, there.

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Okay, we better...well, I hear
these little guys smother easy.

NAME: ROXANNE
What's it feel like to be a hero?

NAME: HAL
Well...I'm just a man doing what
men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,
aren't you?

NAME: REPORTER
Were you scared?

NAME: HAL
Scared? Who had time?

NAME: MASTER MIND
John Cusack, huh? So all I have to
do is have a cute puppy dog stare,
be willing to make a fool of myself
and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Please, get a hold of yourself.

NAME: ROXANNE
Shit.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.

NAME: ROXANNE
You're...you're.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the
actor.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think
remember something from that one -
Let's see: "My head is screaming `I
want you and need you' - my heart
it keeps reaching to see you and
feel you - yet in the end, I'm
alone once again." Wow, I scare
even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just
really into poetry. Probably
because I'm so sensitive and always
going to great lengths to express
myself. But enough about me. Can I
fill you up?

NAME: ROXANNE
...Yes.
I mean, excuse me?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Can I fill you up? Your coffee.

NAME: ROXANNE
Right.

NAME: ROXANNE
I did have a boyfriend - until
fairly recently.

NAME: ROXANNE
I'm sorry - this is so surreal!

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Yeah, they charge way too much at
these places - Now back to your
boyfriend. I'm interested and
compassionate. I want to know about
you.

NAME: ROXANNE
Things were complicated. He was a
man married to his work. There
was...there was a lot of
competition in his line of
business. I'm sure you know what
that's like.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Sure. In my business, one thing I
have is RIVALS. For example, mine
is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.

NAME: ROXANNE
...The body-builder who used to
play The Hulk on TV?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Did he? Well, we're always up for
the same roles. Did your boyfriend
have someone like that? A
particular rival that was always
getting his goat - so to speak?

NAME: ROXANNE
Well...one rival in particular
seemed to get more of his attention
than I ever did. But enough about
my problems.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK" (CONT'D)
NAME: WONDER WHERE OUR REFILLS ARE!!!
I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.
Had it ever since Serendipity. I
again. Please, go on.

NAME: ROXANNE
Right, well, he seemed to need him
more than he needed me.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
How do you mean?

NAME: ROXANNE
It was conflict he thrived on. He
always said he wouldn't know what
to do with himself if Master - I
mean, this guy were gone. It was
like he needed it, like oxygen.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
I think I finally understand...The
only logical answer is to recreate
that rivalry - or if that's
impossible, create one of equal
structure. That's it!

NAME: ROXANNE
What?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing
for a part...where I play a man who
talks to himself at inappropriate
times.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
I have to go right now, but I'd
really like to see you again - if
that's alright.

NAME: ROXANNE
I'd love that.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Got her nose!

NAME: MASTER MIND
I've got it!

NAME: MASTER MIND
I've got it!

NAME: MASTER MIND
It's plain and simple.
Extraordinary minds need
extraordinary stimulation. Without
that stimulus they wither and die.
Therefore, there is only one
logical conclusion: I must create a
new superhero.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Yeah, maybe that's not such hot
idea...

NAME: MASTER MIND
Prepare for Operation Superhero
Genesis!

NAME: MASTER MIND
Prepare the subject.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Plato, pour the toxic waste.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Drainage.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Well, Severs?

NAME: SEVERS
I feel fine. Just a little sticky,
but aside from that everything's
completely -

NAME: MASTER MIND
Okay then.

NAME: MASTER MIND
And this one?

NAME: PLATO
We attached gills to him. He can
breath under water.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Ah. Does he have extraordinary
strength?

NAME: PLATO
Well...no.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Can he fly?

NAME: PLATO
No.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Resilient to weapons fire?

NAME: PLATO
No.

NAME: MASTER MIND
He just breathes under water, then.

NAME: PLATO
Ah...yeah.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Plato, the radioactive spider,
please.

NAME: STENWICK
Ow!

NAME: MASTER MIND
Anything, Stenwick?

NAME: STENWICK
No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this
was about spiders. I have a pretty
severe case of arachnophobia.

NAME: MASTER MIND
We're gonna need more venom.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
How `bout now, Stenwick?
....Stenwick?

NAME: MASTER MIND
This has proven to be a challenge.
I just don't know what I want. What
do I want?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
I want a man of moral fiber with a
strong sense of right and wrong.
Someone who doesn't seek power -
instead, they must have it thrust
upon them and find, within
themselves, the courage to rise to
the occasion.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Yeah, well, it sounds like what you
want is Uberman.

NAME: MASTER MIND
That's it! Why make a copy when the
real thing will do?

NAME: EINSTEIN
I was just kidding, sir. In case
you forgot, you actually burned
Uberman alive.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Then we'll make a new one. Plato,
bring me the box!

NAME: MASTER MIND
Behold - Uberessence. The very
thing that gave Uberman his
superhuman powers.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Where the hell did you get that?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh, I shot him with a power sucking
gun and had this idea to use this
to clone a whole army of evil
Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never
got around to following up with
that.

NAME: PLATO
I believe he defeated you before
you could, master.

NAME: MASTER MIND
...Right. Man, he was good!

NAME: DA VINCI
You want another volunteer, sir?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Not another volunteer driven by the
need for personal gain. Somebody
else, somebody pure.

NAME: NEWS REPORTER
...who risked his own life to save
that of a young mother and her
child.

NAME: HAL
Please, please, you're embarrassing
me. I saw someone in need and I
helped them. What more can we ask
of ourselves. I ask you, what more?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Somebody like him!

NAME: PLATO
Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece
of work. He used to teach bowling
at Kingpin's.

NAME: MASTER MIND
A modest profession to brilliantly
hide his true heroic nature. I love
it.

NAME: PLATO
Then you are absolutely going to
love this -

NAME: PLATO
- He volunteers at a school for the
blind.

NAME: MASTER MIND
He volunteers. He doesn't ask for
any reward for his deeds. The fates
are shining down on me. This Mr.
Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.

NAME: HAL
You greedy little bastard. I
already gave you a twenty.

NAME: BLIND KID
Hey, you want me to play along?
Then pay up, bitch!

NAME: HAL
Fine, but you better be convincing.

NAME: HAL
Here she comes, go to work.

NAME: BLIND KID
Why can't I see! Why God?

NAME: HAL
Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me
look at you.

NAME: HAL
You know, in life we're all given
no more than we can bear. This
happened to you maybe because you
were meant to rise above it - Maybe
to be an inspiration to the other
little Peteys out there.

NAME: BLIND KID
You really think so, Hal?

NAME: HAL
Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?
Now c'mon, go feel your way to
class before you get your little
butt suspended.

NAME: HAL
Petey, wait a minute.

NAME: HAL
Don't run into anything!

NAME: PLATO
I think I've seen enough, sir. This
is your guy.

NAME: HAL
(obviously playing it up
for the woman's benefit)
Oh, there it is again. This is
really getting embarrassing now.

NAME: ATTRACTIVE   WOMAN
Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man
who saved that woman   and her baby
the other day! It is   you, isn't it?

NAME: HAL
Oh, crap. You got me.

NAME: ATTRACTIVE WOMAN
Hey, you're on TV again.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
This just in. Upon a second look at
that tape from this morning, which
we'll now replay for you, it
appears it was not the heroic act
it first seemed to be.

NAME: BRAD HELMS (O.S.) (CONT'D)
With the tape slowed down you can
actually see the man push the woman
and her child out of the way in an
effort to save his own life.

NAME: HAL
I guess that looks kinda bad.

NAME: DA VINCI
There he is, boss.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Now, we're sure this won't kill
him?

NAME: PLATO
Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight
electrical shock.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Good.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Slight electrical shock?

NAME: HAL
God, I hate the weather in this
city.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Follow him.

NAME: CAT
You don't look so good, man.

NAME: HAL
I don't feel good. I was struck by
freaking lightening.

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?

NAME: CAT
No, you're just hallucinating. By
the way, we're out of orange juice.

NAME: HAL
Man...

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Oh, God!

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Oh, God!

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Oh, God!

NAME: HAL
Wait!

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Something's not right here.

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Wake up! Wake up, Hal!

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Okay, okay. Let's get it together,
man.

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
This is just some sort
of...episode. It will pass, it will
pass.

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Well, not too fast I hope.

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
Yes, fast, fast!

NAME: HAL (CONT'D)
I think I need to go home.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Welcome to your second birth, Hal
Stewart.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Instruction is very important in
the formative years. Every hero
needs a mentor, a father figure to
look up to.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Perfect.

NAME: HAL
Who are you!?

NAME: VOICE
I am the guide on your journey.
Fate has chosen you to be it's
champion.

NAME: HAL
Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I
must be losing it.

NAME: HAL
Jesus! This isn't happening, this
isn't happening.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Calm. All things must be filtered
through calmness.

NAME: HAL
Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to
freak out.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
I think we must work on your
attitude first.

NAME: HAL
Look I'm gonna call the cops in
about two seconds if you don't get
out of here.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Are you calm now?

NAME: HAL
Yeah, I'm okay.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Good, because we've got a lot of
work to do.

NAME: HAL
What the hell was that for?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Rule number one: expect the
unexpected.

NAME: HAL
Can you just tell me what this is
all about?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
The heavens are not in the habit of
bestowing a gift such as this to
just anyone. You are being rewarded
for being a man of great moral
fortitude with an unwavering belief
in humanity.

NAME: HAL
That's me alright.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
I am to train you so you may
fulfill your destiny to defeat the
great menace to Metro City: Master
Mind.

NAME: "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
Come.

NAME: HAL
We're are we going?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
To train.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Strength is just as much in the
mind as it is the muscle. Remember,
both need to be exercised.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Hey, Corky? You listening?

NAME: HAL
Yeah, work both muscles.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Trust me.

NAME: HAL
What are you doing!?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
An invulnerability test. Something
wrong?

NAME: HAL
Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to
get shot. Do not fire that thing!

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
You're bulletproof.

NAME: HAL
Okay, do you know that for sure?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
I do now.

NAME: HAL
You suck.

NAME: HAL
Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.
Two Russian Migs coming in hard and
fast.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Hey!

NAME: HAL
What?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
What did I tell you? Stomach down,
hands up.

NAME: HAL
God, I feel so gay.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
What is it?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Yes, it's John Cusack.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
...As did I.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
I'd love to!

NAME: "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
I mean, I AM a little hungry.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Sure!

NAME: HAL
WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's
like fly - Oh my God, I almost said
it was like flying.

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
For the rest of the day I want you
to continue to practice your flying
posture.

NAME: HAL
Why, where're ya going?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
...To do something...mysterious
...and Asian.

NAME: HAL
Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at
it, then.

NAME: ROXANNE
How's your sandwich?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
It's quite delicious.

NAME: ROXANNE
Hope you don't think I'm too
forward. Some men are intimidated
when a woman asks them out. I just
find you really easy to talk to.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
And I you.

NAME: ROXANNE
You know, you're not at all like
you are in the movies.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
I'm not?

NAME: ROXANNE
Yeah. I don't know - You have this
strange, refined way of speaking.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
I do? That is most interesting.

NAME: ROXANNE
Anyway, when we were talking the
other day I just felt, even though
we only talked for a couple of
hours, that we've known each other
for years.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
I know just what you mean.

NAME: ROXANNE
You know what? This sandwich is
disgusting.

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
Of course I already ate half of it.
I wonder what that says about my
character?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
It means you don't give up on a
sandwich. You see that it has
potential, and you give it every
chance to be all it can be.

NAME: ROXANNE
Thanks, but knowing me, I was
probably projecting my expectations
of what a lunch should be on the
sandwich. It might have been okay
at first, but I just made it
bitter.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Is that what happened with your
last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?

NAME: ROXANNE
When I look back, I probably
shouldn't of expected so much from
him. He was already a giving
person. You know, one of those go
out and save the world types.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
I've run into a few.

NAME: ROXANNE
I was selfish, I guess. I didn't
want to share him with anybody
else.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
It sounds like he was a special
man.

NAME: ROXANNE
They broke the mold.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Perhaps not.

NAME: TITAN
What's the "T" stand for?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Titan.

NAME: TITAN
What's that supposed to mean?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's
father...oh, just go with it. You
look perfect.

NAME: TITAN
I don't think this mask is big
enough. Are you sure no one is
gonna recognize me?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
It's fine, just don't slouch. It's
all in the posture.

NAME: "PAT MORITA" (CONT'D)
It is time.

NAME: JOHN
Alright folks, this is a robbery.
Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,
yadda...

NAME: GEORGE
The safe. Let's go.

NAME: BANK MANAGER
Okay, just don't hurt anyone.

NAME: GEORGE
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

NAME: TITAN
Well, boys, there's no need for all
this just to get the free toaster.

NAME: PAUL
What are you suppose to be?

NAME: TITAN
Justice.

NAME: GEORGE
Well, justice, suck on this...

NAME: TITAN
Now it's my turn.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Hey, George, here comes the sun.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Say, Paul, your mother should
know...that you're a scumbag.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
John, all you need is love...

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
...and a good urologist.

NAME: HAL
Well, Ringo...um...um...you're
under arrest.

NAME: BANK MANAGER
On behalf of the First National
Bank of Metro City, I'd like to
offer you a reward for your act of
bravery.

NAME: TITAN
Ten thousand dollars!

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
I...can't except this. Law and
order is it's own...um...reward.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
This story's mine.

NAME: ROXANNE
Listen, Brad. We were just in the
area. I was just trying to -

NAME: BRAD HELMS
I've been in this business long
enough to know pretty well what you
were "just trying to do." Besides,
I heard you couldn't take the big
game anymore and were put on fluff
detail?

NAME: SETH
You're not gonna take that from
him, are you?

NAME: ROXANNE
He's right. Old habit, I guess.
We'll get out of your way.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake
supper somewhere that needs
covering.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
For months now, since the death of
Uberman, the citizens of Metro City
have been holding out for a hero.
Well, it appears they won't have to
hold out for much longer as a new
costumed crusader has suddenly
stormed onto the scene. Today, at
the Metro Savings and Trust, a
masked mystery man single-handedly
defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just
who is this new caped avenger?

NAME: BRAD HELMS
I'm sure all of our viewers are now
wondering, what's the "T" stand
for?

NAME: TITAN
It's a message to all the scum out
there. Uberman may be gone, but
Metro City has a new protector, and
his name is "Tighten!"

NAME: REPORTER
How do you spell that?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't
believe it. He misspelled his name.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
No matter, I suppose.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
We've now fully established Titan
as Metro City's hero. They will
love him just as they loved
Uberman. Everything is going
according to plan.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
jail.

NAME: MASTER MIND
You know, Einstein, maybe I should
have called you Socrates. He also
didn't know when to keep his
thoughts to himself.

NAME: EINSTEIN
I just fail to see the point in all
of this. I mean, why are we
creating another superhero when it
was such a pain in the ass for you
to get rid of the other one? I
mean, Uberman is destroyed, we
should be using this opportunity
to...to...

NAME: MASTER MIND
To what?

NAME: EINSTEIN
I don't know. To take over the
weather, space, the world -
whatever super villains are
SUPPOSED to do.

NAME: MASTER MIND
The reason someone like you will
always be a minion is because you
have no foresight. We take over the
earth, like you said. Then what?
Women? Cars? Money? Even the
grandest treasures will lose their
lustre if you don't have someone to
hold them over.

NAME: EINSTEIN
That's it! This balance of the
force bullshit is getting way too
Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's
with me?

NAME: MASTER MIND
You dare?

NAME: EINSTEIN
Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing
stupid costumes, and I'm sick of
working for a super villain who's
turning into a softie.

NAME: MASTER MIND
What - did - you - call me?

NAME: EINSTEIN
You heard me. You used to be an
inhuman monster, now look at you.
You're creating super heroes, you
don't go with us on robberies
anymore, it's been days since you
threatened anyone, oh, and not to
mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.

NAME: MASTER MIND
THAT is none of your business,
knave!

NAME: EINSTEIN
Hey, you guys haven't sealed the
deal yet, have you?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Silence!

NAME: EINSTEIN
Oh, Master, your head is so big.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I'm warning you, Einstein.

NAME: EINSTEIN
Take me!

NAME: MASTER MIND
I said silence!

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Get out of my sight.

NAME: ROXANNE
Don't get me wrong, I love being a
reporter. I don't think I could do
anything else. It's the
consequences of what we do that I'm
having a problem with.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
That's where journalistic
responsibility comes in, no?

NAME: ROXANNE
It's supposed to.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Sounds to me like you're running
from something.

NAME: ROXANNE
I got someone I cared about killed.
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't
have been involved.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
You can't blame yourself. My father
used to say each of us must answer
the great call to truly feel alive.

NAME: ROXANNE
Was he an actor?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
...No. He was...a landscaper. And a
horrible one. I mean he would fail
time and time again at
his...landscaping. And sometimes
he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown
in jail -

NAME: ROXANNE
Jail?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
My point is he took the good with
the bad. He grew a little each
time. Improved, learned.

NAME: ROXANNE
Was he ever successful?

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
God, no...but don't let deter you.

NAME: ROXANNE
Thanks for this. You know, this is
embarrassing, but it's been a long
time since I -

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
I think it's starting to rain. We
might want to find a table inside.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
What were you gonna say?

NAME: ROXANNE
Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a
long time since...well, I've been
with someone I...enjoy being with.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
To people who enjoy being with each
other.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Oh, no. Don't look at me.

NAME: "JOHN CUSACK"
Okay, never mind that. Now, where
were we?

NAME: ROXANNE
Oh my God.

NAME: MASTER MIND
You're not gonna get all freaky
about this, are you?

NAME: ROXANNE
This...this is too much, even for
you. God, I go out with you, tell
you my innermost thoughts.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I only did this because I wanted to
talk to you on the same level. You
know, without all the baggage?

NAME: ROXANNE
Baggage? You burned my boyfriend
alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!

NAME: MASTER MIND
You see, that's exactly what I'm
talking about.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Roxanne!

NAME: ROXANNE
Stay away from me.

NAME: MASTER MIND
What?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,
it's his fault. He's the one who
sent me on this weak-willed path.
I'll filet his scrotum for this.
Me, a creature of evil, in love
with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.
I hardly give such matters thought

NAME: MASTER MIND
I should just go up there and just
lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I
like you - I always have. Oh, and
I'm sorry I blew up your ex.
(realizing the absurdity of his
words) Yeah, that would go over
like a pants-less clown at a
child's birthday party. What the
hell am I even doing here? Who
cares what she thinks? I'm a
supervillain and here I am acting
like a love struck schoolboy.
Forget this. I control my own
destiny!

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Perfect.

NAME: ROXANNE
Damn.

NAME: ROXANNE
Please be open.

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
Thank God.

NAME: ROXANNE
A pack of Lady Strikes, please.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Hello, Triple A?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I'll call you back.

NAME: SHOPKEEPER
Hey!

NAME: SHOTGUN HOODLUM
Shut up, Gramps.

NAME: SHOTGUN HOODLUM (CONT'D)
Gimme that necklace!

NAME: ROXANNE
I don't think so.

NAME: SHOTGUN HOODLUM
I said give it to me!

NAME: SHOTGUN HOODLUM
What the hell's that? A super
soaker?

NAME: MASTER MIND
No, it's a goo gun.

NAME: SHOTGUN HOODLUM
Yeah, what's it do?

NAME: MASTER MIND
It goos.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
It's...a prototype.

NAME: SHOPKEEPER
I know you! You Master Brain guy.
You a hero.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Don't - EVER - say that again.

NAME: ROXANNE
Hey!

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
Are you following me or something?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Don't flatter yourself.

NAME: ROXANNE
Don't walk away from me when I'm
talking to you.

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
What a minute...all that stuff you
use to say to me when Uberman was
alive - about me being the loyal
queen by your side as you rule over
Metro City. That wasn't just super
villain rhetoric, was it? You
actually meant it!

NAME: MASTER MIND
My, someone has a rather high
opinion of themselves.

NAME: ROXANNE
Do you really think I would be with
someone like you?

NAME: MASTER MIND
No.

NAME: PLATO
Everything alright, sir?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Fine, why do you ask?

NAME: PLATO
You...just...seem...

NAME: MASTER MIND
Go on.

NAME: PLATO
...distracted.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Just with business, my minion. Just
with business. I've decided it is
time.

NAME: PLATO
You mean?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yes, we've created our hero, now
it's time to give him a little
motivation.

NAME: DA VINCI
How do we do that?

NAME: MASTER MIND
To be simply good is not enough. A
hero must be driven by an almost
relentless desire to right a wrong
that can never be corrected.

NAME: PLATO
You mean?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yes, he must lose someone near and
dear to him - his father figure.
Gentlemen, it's time for Operation
Mentor Kill!

NAME: TITAN
Man, what the hell happened down
there? Wait a sec -

NAME: TITAN
Crap.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
You okay?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
I'm dying, kid. There is just one
last lesson I have for you. It is
the most important of all.

NAME: TITAN
What's that?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Master Mind did this, you must
avenge me.

NAME: TITAN
Master Mind? Why?

NAME: "PAT MORITA"
Because he's evil. You must stop
the evil Hal - stop the...

NAME: REPORTER 1
Tighten, Is this the work of Master
Mind?

NAME: REPORTER 2
How will the death of your mentor
affect your resolve?

NAME: REPORTER 3
Was that Pat Morita?

NAME: TITAN
This injustice will not go
unpunished. Master Mind, if you can
hear me, Tighten is coming for you.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Alright, people, we don't have much
time. Titan should be here any
minute, so let's get the lead out.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
How's the death ray coming?

NAME: DA VINCI
Nearly up to full power, sir.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Hum. Let's turn it down a few
notches. It's his first time and
we don't want to get in a lucky
shot, now do we?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Anything on the radar yet?

NAME: PLATO
Not yet, sir.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I see. Well, he must be planning
something big. Are the flame
androids deployed?

NAME: PLATO
All twelve.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da
Vinci, take your places next to me.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
No slouching.

NAME: PLATO
He's certainly taking his time.

NAME: MASTER MIND
He'll be here. That's the way it
works.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Unprofessional, that's what this
is. No, it's disrespect for the
craft.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Would Uberman have kept us waiting
like this? Of course not. He was a
pro who knew the score. It's time
we spelled out a few things for
this Titan. I will not be made a
fool of.

NAME: TITAN
Oh, for crying out loud.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Do you know who I am?

NAME: TITAN
Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!
You're actually the guy I want to
see!

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh, so NOW you want to get down to
it. Well, I want to get a few
things off my chest first.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Of all the inconsiderate - Do you
have any idea how long we waited
for you? We're you even planning on
coming to me and getting revenge?

NAME: TITAN
Well, at first I was going to. You
know, because that's what I figured
I was supposed to do. But then I
got to thinking-

NAME: MASTER MIND
-You got to thinking? There's
nothing to think about. I'm the
villain. I do something bad, you
come and get me.

NAME: TITAN
- I got to thinking...what's the
point?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Maybe you're right. What's the
point?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
What are these?

NAME: TITAN
That's what I wanted to talk to you
about.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Where did you get all this?

NAME: TITAN
Get this: I stole them.

NAME: MASTER MIND
From where?

NAME: TITAN
From all over. You see, once you
killed Pat and ruined my other
apartment building I was pretty
pissed off, so I figured I'd go,
find you and kick some ass. Then I
thought to myself: "Okay,then
what?" I mean, if we were to fight,
what would I get out of it? Would I
get my apartment back? Would I be
able to pay the bills?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Well, what about your mentor?

NAME: TITAN
Tell you the truth? He was kind of
a dick. I mean, being a hero is
dandy and all, but it's volunteer
work. Now you've always had the
right take on all this. I mean,
when you rob a bank or take over
the diamond exchange you get
something out of it. I mean, when
you don't get caught, which, no
offense, isn't very often. And that
brings me to what I wanted to
propose to you: Who could catch you
if I'm by your side?

NAME: MASTER MIND
You want to team-up?

NAME: TITAN
You got the brains, I got the
brawn. We could even call ourselves
that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at
this.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
I even designed us some new
costumes.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
See, you'd be brain, so you got a
little one on your costume, and
then I'll have brawn on mine...once
I figure out the best, you know,
visual interpretation of it. What
do you think?

NAME: MASTER MIND
What do I think?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
I think you're probably the biggest
idiot I've ever met. I mean, I
can't believe you. All your gifts,
all your powers, and all you want
to use them for is your own
financial fulfillment. You know
what? Your kind of people make me
sick.

NAME: TITAN
I worked hard on this.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh - gee - I am so sorry!

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Of all the people to pick, it had
to be this loser.

NAME: TITAN
Now, hold on. You're going a little
too far.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I wish your mother said that to
your father the night of your
conception, they would have saved
me a whole lot of heartache.

NAME: TITAN
Hey, I mean it.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

NAME: DA VINCI
Master!

NAME: DA VINCI
What hurts?

NAME: MASTER MIND
It!

NAME: TITAN
I don't need you, I don't need
anybody. I have the power to do and
take anything I want. And now, I'm
gonna take back everything this
city owes me. Beware Metro City,
it's time for Titan to collect.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY

NAME: DA VINCI
How'd the plan go, boss?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I just made myself redundant, old
friend.

NAME: DA VINCI
It's not that bad.

NAME: SECURITY GUARD
Morning, Tighten.

NAME: TITAN
Morning.

NAME: SECURITY GUARD
Is there something we can do for
you?

NAME: TITAN
Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just
here to make a withdrawal.

NAME: BANK MANAGER
Say, did he just rob us?

NAME: SECURITY GUARD
Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't
it?

NAME: BANK MANAGER
Yeah.

NAME: SECURITY GUARD
Should I, you know, stop him?

NAME: BANK MANAGER
Umm...Yeah.

NAME: BANK MANAGER (CONT'D)
(looking down at the
guard)
He did rob us, didn't he?

NAME: BRAD HELMS
"Absolute power corrupts
absolutely." When Lord Acton stated
that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell
Creighton in 1887, no one thought
much about it, but today Metro City
is reeling from that very prophecy.
Tighten, who many thought of as our
savior, has turned his back on the
cause of justice.

NAME: PLATO
I don't understand it. He seemed to
have every characteristic we were
looking for in a superhero.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Well, there's no use crying about
it now, we must take action. I'm
not going to play second fiddle to
that crass buffoon. We must destroy
Tighten.

NAME: PLATO
It won't be easy. Uberman had a
sense of decency and genuine love
for the people. That was his
weakness and was easily used
against him.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yes, but he possesses the same
flaws present in Uberman's DNA -
copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin
always said: "If something works
don't dick with it."

NAME: TITAN
I can have anything I want. I'm
like a god.

NAME: TITAN
Point to any woman in this bar. I
could have her in a second.

NAME: TITAN
Hey, you wanna get with this?

NAME: BARTENDER
Buddy, what do you want?

NAME: TITAN
NAME: 83.
What do you want? That's the
question, isn't it. I mean, what do
you want when you can have
everything?
I suppose what I really want is to
never be forgotten again. I want to
do something that can never be cast
aside or one-upped. I want a -
what's it called? - A legacy. I
want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I
like the sound that.

NAME: BARTENDER
I meant, what do you want to drink?

NAME: TITAN
Oh.

NAME: TITAN
What?

NAME: MASTER MIND
There can be only one master
criminal in this city - and it's
me.

NAME: TITAN
Really?

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
I guess I should leave town then,
huh?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I have a better idea - NOW!

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
NAME: 84.
That's copper my good man. Your one
weakness.
For all your amazing gifts of brawn
you are no match for my intellect.

NAME: TITAN
You know what? You're nothing but a
bug. Not even worth my effort.

NAME: MASTER MIND
He's not as dumb as I thought.

NAME: PLATO
I guess not...Funny, though.

NAME: MASTER MIND
What's funny?

NAME: PLATO
Funny Uberman didn't think of the
same thing.

NAME: HAL
That's it!

NAME: HAL
Hello, Legacy.

NAME: VINNIE
Hey, that's my ball!

NAME: ELDERLY WOMAN
That was a close one. Sixth floor,
please.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Wow, I always thought Uberman was
your first superhero - but it looks
like our little Roxanne dated a
linebacker in college.

NAME: ROXANNE
That's my diary.

NAME: MASTER MIND
So it is.

NAME: ROXANNE
It's personal.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Well, then I wouldn't leave it in
your underwear drawer for just
anyone to find.

NAME: ROXANNE
What do you want?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I need your help.

NAME: ROXANNE
So you knock me out and tie me to a
chair?

NAME: MASTER MIND
You're not going to like what I'm
about to tell you.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
It's chaos here in city square as
city police -

NAME: ROXANNE
He's really out of control.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Tell me about it.

NAME: ROXANNE
I should have known. You have
something to do with this, don't
you? - With Titan turning evil.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Well, the evil thing he did by
himself. My goal was to give MYSELF
purpose by creating an intellectual
sparring partner.

NAME: ROXANNE
You're talking like you made him.

NAME: MASTER MIND
And they call me Master Mind.

NAME: ROXANNE
Let me get this straight. You
missed getting your ass kicked, so
you made a new guy to kick your
ass. That's pathetic.

NAME: MASTER MIND
In hindsight...

NAME: ROXANNE
And his powers, they're just like
Uberman's. Why would he have his
powers?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I had some left over from
something. I infused him with it.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yeah, that's why I decided to tie
you up.

NAME: ROXANNE
You did all this because you wanted
purpose?

NAME: MASTER MIND
He seemed nice.

NAME: TITAN
Closer. I want to show the people
my real face.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Recognize me?

NAME: ROXANNE
Hal Stewart. He's the guy we
thought saved that woman and kid.
Turned out he was just trying to
save his own ass.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yeah, good to know - NOW!

NAME: TITAN
That's right, I'm really Hal
Stewart. Former hero and bowling
teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.

NAME: ROXANNE
You picked a bowler to give super
powers to?

NAME: MASTER MIND
It's a modest profession!

NAME: TITAN
With my new found power, I've
recently started to wonder what
sort of legacy I should leave.
Should I be a hero? I tried that
once before - even saved a lady and
her baby from being squashed. I was
treated like a god until everyone
started to shit on me - Okay, so
what if I didn't "purposely" save
them!

NAME: TITAN
Well, I'm going to make something
that can't be taken away from me.
I'm going to create a permanent
monument to my greatness. One that
won't be so easily forgotten or
erased.

NAME: TITAN
I intend to create a new category
in the Guinness Book of World's
Records by rolling the biggest
strike in the history of bowling.

NAME: TITAN
My thanks to the city planning
commission. This wouldn't have been
possible without them.

NAME: TITAN
Tell your friends and family to
tune in right here to this station
at noon tomorrow.

NAME: ROXANNE
My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy
the whole business triangle.

NAME: ROXANNE
What?

NAME: MASTER MIND
My lair is in the direct path of
the ball.

NAME: ROXANNE
Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want
anything to happen to your hideout,
would we?

NAME: MASTER MIND
You don't understand. I have
certain equipment that's - that's
highly unstable.

NAME: ROXANNE
What do you mean?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,
okay?

NAME: ROXANNE
A HYDROGEN reactor?

NAME: MASTER MIND
It's experimental - only one in the
world...Well, how do you think I
power all my inventions? Someone
like me can't pay for electricity.
The bills would be outrageous.

NAME: MASTER MIND
It creates 100 times the output of
a nuclear one...If destroyed it
could...

NAME: ROXANNE
- Vaporize the entire city!

NAME: MASTER MIND
NAME: 91.
Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,
actually. That little baby is
amazing. I'm quite proud of it.
I mean...we'd better find a way to
stop him.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Did Uberman have a hideout?

NAME: ROXANNE
What?

NAME: MASTER MIND
A cave, a solitary fortress of some
kind. C'mon, all heros have a place
to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,
it may be our only chance to find
something, a clue, anything that
could give us a fighting chance.

NAME: ROXANNE
It's under his house.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Whose house?

NAME: ROXANNE
Wayne Scott's.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne
Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy
philanthropist? But he disappeared -

NAME: ROXANNE
He disappeared just over two months
ago when you killed him. Not only
did you rid the world of a hero,
you killed a kind, noble, generous
man.

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
Looks like you got what you always
wanted. Uberman is out of the
picture and Metro City is doomed.

NAME: MASTER MIND
"Metro City doomed." You know, I
never thought I'd say something
like this, but here it goes -

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Not if I have anything to say about
it.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Such a dark place for one such as
you. I wonder, underneath your
noble deeds, what inner demons
drove you to your endless crusade
for justice?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Good lord, man. You've only been
dead for two months.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
A disguise so simple, it's
ingenious. No wonder I never caught
on.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Two lives, yet in both you were an
ideal. Perhaps it was you who was
victorious in the end, old friend.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
I'll miss how predictable you were.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Hello? Anyone here...besides..all
the BIG MEN who are with me now?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
NAME: 94.
What's the worst you're gonna find?
The man was a boy scout, not a
serial killer.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Ahhhhhh!

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Jesus!

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
What the hell are you doing here?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I might just ask you the same
question. I had thought I
incinerated you.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
You scared the bejesus out of me.
How'd you figure out I was still
alive? Wait, how do you know my
identity!?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,
I forgot to line the bottom of the
copper cage - Somebody pointed that
out to me recently. Figured if they
could do it, so could you. But one
thing I couldn't figure out -

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
The skeleton? Something I
"borrowed" from a medical school a
few months before.

NAME: MASTER MIND
A few months? How long had you been
planning this?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
I always planned to retire -
eventually. I mean, come on, you
can't do this sort of thing in your
fifties. You'd just look
ridiculous.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I see it all so clearly now.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D - V.O) (CONT'D)
Then you must have flown to a safe
distance and waited for the
explosion, then...

NAME: WAYNE
Man, you ARE smart.

NAME: MASTER MIND
But why fake your death? Why go
through all of it? You could have
just quit.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
NAME: 97.
But the responsibility would still
be there.
A cop can retire and stop handing
out speeding tickets - but people
expect more from superheroes. I
tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt
in Zimbabwe without everyone
expecting me to do something about
it. I figured, out of sight, out of
mind.

NAME: MASTER MIND
And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to
disappear?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Both of my lives have so much
baggage. It's time for new baggage,
you know?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I just can't believe it. This whole
time you've been in hiding while a
force of great evil is tearing your
city apart?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
I don't want to hear about it.
That's why I don't have a
television in here to remind me of
all the things I SHOULD be doing.
Hell, I could get a wife to do
that.

NAME: MASTER MIND
There's a demented supervillain out
there about to destroy our - I
mean, your city.

NAME: MASTER MIND
You're really going to do nothing?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Good and evil have a way of
balancing themselves out. If this
guy is as bad as you say, somebody
will rise up to fight him. It's
just the order of things. You found
me, didn't you?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
I know it's hard, but you'll find
someone else someday.

NAME: MASTER MIND
You're the only one who can stop
him.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a
plane to catch.

NAME: MASTER MIND
A plane?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Going to Barbados for a little
change in climate. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I got to go pack.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT (CONT'D)
You were a good foe. I'm sorry if
I've let you down. If it makes a
difference, you were the best foe a
hero could ask for.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Not smart enough to come up with a
full-proof trap.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Well, you did almost have me when
you figured out my weakness was
copper. Now that made me sweat a
little. Took me way too long to
drill out from under that cage.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I got lucky.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Anyway, it's a good thing for my
sake that I could always count on
you for an out.

NAME: MASTER MIND
What do you mean?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
C'mon, we always threw each other a
couple of bones. You would always
leave me an out in one of your
`full-proof' traps, and I'd never
had you incarcerated at a
penitentiary that you couldn't
eventually escape from. It kept our
little game going.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Game? - Was that all this ever was
to you? You know, I was trying my
best every time I fought you. Those
`outs' as you call them were
unintentional.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Oh.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I guess I was never really a match
for you, was I?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Then how can I expect to be one for
Titan?

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
What about Roxanne?

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
I think we both got what we wanted
out of our relationship. She got a
career out of me, and I got plenty
of other things out of her. But I'm
ready to move on to greener
pastures.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I guess I wasn't the villain I
thought I was, and you...you
weren't the hero I thought you
were.

NAME: WAYNE SCOTT
Roxanne! How long have you been...

NAME: ROXANNE
Long enough.

NAME: ROXANNE (CONT'D)
Don't you have something else you
can go do?

NAME: TITAN
Alright, I want this whole thing to
look ESPN professional, understand?

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
You guys are about to get some good
footage. I might need a little
room, though.

NAME: TANK LOUDSPEAKER
Titan, we have orders from the city
of Metro to take you into custody.
If you do not give your self up
willingly, we will be forced to
open fire.

NAME: TANK LOUDSPEAKER
What is your answer?

NAME: TITAN
Miss me?

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Didn't mean to get you involved in
all of this.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Hey, man! You killed my suds!

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
That's one was for you, beer.

NAME: TITAN
Guys, please tell me you got that
last bit.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
Huh?

NAME: TITAN
You're kidding me. I give you my
sexiest moves and you mean to tell
me it was for nothing?

NAME: BRAD HELMS
We were afraid something might hit
us.

NAME: TITAN
Looks like I've given the story of
the century to the wrong man.

NAME: TITAN
Wait. What about that other
reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on
the topper half, but killer legs.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a
much better reporter than I am. You
want her.

NAME: TITAN
Where can I find her.

NAME: FRANK
We're actually not supposed to give
out that sort of information.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe
she lives in a penthouse.

NAME: TITAN
You've been very helpful.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Hurry, we must be on our way as
soon as possible.

NAME: DA VINCI
Master, why must we flee?

NAME: MASTER MIND
I told you, Titan is too powerful.
If he's set on destroying us,
there's precious little we could do
about it.

NAME: DA VINCI
Where are we going?

NAME: MASTER MIND
To another city, someplace with a
shitload of superheroes to fight.
We'll start over, we'll go back to
doing what we do best.

NAME: PLATO
With our tails between our legs?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Plato, do you have a better plan?!

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Hello...Roxanne?

NAME: ROXANNE
What are you going to do about
Tighten?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Right now I'm packing, later I'll
have a snack on the train.

NAME: ROXANNE
You're running away?

NAME: MASTER MIND
In a word - yes.

NAME: ROXANNE
You created this monster...

NAME: MASTER MIND
I didn't create this - the god's of
irony did and I am eating the crow
I so richly deserve.

NAME: ROXANNE
There's no time for self pity.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I'll make the time.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
You can leave with us. You'll be
safe.

NAME: ROXANNE
I'm not going anywhere.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Will you listen to me, no one can
stop him.

NAME: ROXANNE
You have to try. The city needs
your help.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I'm afraid you have an inflated
opinion of me.

NAME: ROXANNE
What the hell's happened to you?
The Master Mind I knew would never
have run from a fight even though
he knew deep in his heart that he
didn't have a chance in hell of
winning it. It was your best
quality. You need to be that man
right now...I...

NAME: MASTER MIND
What?

NAME: ROXANNE
I believe in you.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Sweet words, but that man is dead.
Please, Roxanne, just come with me.

NAME: ROXANNE
No...I guess you are a coward after
all.

NAME: TITAN
Man, have I got a story for you.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Roxanne? Roxanne?

NAME: TITAN
What pose would be best? The corny
folded arms thing?

NAME: TITAN
Or maybe on the hips, like this.

NAME: TITAN
No, makes me look like a flamer
pirate.

NAME: FRANK
Shouldn't we be making a run for it
right about now?

NAME: ROXANNE
The guy can outrun bullets. I don't
think either one of us is in that
kind of shape.

NAME: TITAN
She's right, Frank.

NAME: TITAN
Also got super hearing. I promise
not to keep the both of you long,
but you'll thank me when this is
all over.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Dad, it's me...
(he looks around to make
sure no one can hear)
...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked
in a while, and I'm sorry. It's
been a little crazy trying to live
up to a legacy.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Anyway...You raised me to be the
worst that I could possibly be. And
I've tried to live up to that as
best as I could - even dropping out
of dentistry school like you wanted
me to. But I'm about to do
something now that would really
piss you off. I'm going to go
against everything you ever taught
me. I hope...I hope that maybe
you'll look down at what I'm about
to do as not so much a good deed,
but more like the outright defiance
of a hateful and ungrateful, son.
If you could do that, then maybe -
in your own little way - you could -
for probably the first time - find
a reason to be proud of me.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Well...either way, you're probably
going to see me real soon.
(calling over his
shoulder)
Men?

NAME: PLATO AND DA VINCI
Yes Sir?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Stop packing. Our work is not
finished here.

NAME: REPORTER
We interrupt your regular afternoon
programming to show you live
footage of a potential dangerous
situation in downtown Metro. The
former hero knows as Titan is
placing what appears to be a giant
ball...

NAME: REPORTER
Hold on...It appears our own
Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the
scene. We now go to her with a live
report.

NAME: DA VINCI
Sir, I think you should see this!

NAME: ROXANNE
I'm here with the cause of the
destruction in Metro City. He has
kidnapped me and a cameraman to
chronicle what he refers to as the
creation of a monument to his
invincibility and overall
"Asskickiness." He will use this
giant concrete bowling ball to play
the largest game of bowling ever
using the buildings of downtown
Metro City as his pins.

NAME: TITAN
And I'm going for the biggest
strike ever.

NAME: TITAN
And you, Metro City, have a
ringside seat as I cement my name
in the anal of history.

NAME: ROXANNE
Annals.

NAME: TITAN
What?

NAME: ROXANNE
Nevermind.

NAME: TITAN
NAME: 110.
(in quiet professional
bowler announcer voice)
Like Tiger before him, a young
savior has come to raise a sport
from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,
a young man with a dream, realizing
that dream here today, folks.
One might click there heels and say
"There's no place like home" upon
finding themselves in such a
fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much
at home right were he is - with a
ball in hand and glory in his
sights.

NAME: ROXANNE
Hal, I know everyone treated you
like shit, but you don't have to do
this.

NAME: TITAN
You're right. I don't HAVE to do
anything. Isn't that cool?

NAME: TITAN
Here's one for the record books!

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
What the...?

NAME: FRANK
Look, what's that flying in the
air?

NAME: MASTER MIND
C'mon, slow down

NAME: MASTER MIND
C'mon.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Gutterball!

NAME: MASTER MIND
Bowling? What other trailer park
sports can you play?

NAME: TITAN
You are becoming a real pain in my
ass. I should have done this a long
time ago.

NAME: MASTER   MIND (CONT'D)
Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,
he's falling for   it.

NAME: TITAN
What the hell?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
fruit.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
No more games.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Could it really be that easy--

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
Didn't think so.

NAME: TITAN
If you don't mind, I'm going to
punch trough your face now.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I'm alive.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Uberman?

NAME: BYSTANDER 1
It's Uberman!

NAME: BYSTANDER 2
Uberman's alive!

NAME: BYSTANDER 3
We're saved!

NAME: MASTER MIND
I thought.

NAME: UBERMAN
So did I.

NAME: UBERMAN
Thank you, old enemy.

NAME: MASTER MIND
For what?

NAME: UBERMAN
Showing me the error of my ways,
Showing me I'm meant to be this
city's savior, showing me that,
while we can try, there is no
running away from our true destiny.

NAME: TITAN
Oh...Did I interrupt something?

NAME: TITAN
Where you going, buddy?

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Welcome to Paintown. Population:
you.

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Time to finish this.

NAME: TITAN
What?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Quick joke - What's the capital of
Thailand?

NAME: TITAN
Huh - I don't know.

NAME: MASTER MIND
It's bang cock!

NAME: TITAN (CONT'D)
Ow.

NAME: MASTER MIND
So, I guess pennies are good for
something.

NAME: ROXANNE
Pretty strange, huh?

NAME: MASTER MIND
They're cheering for me.

NAME: ROXANNE
You saved them. You saved
everybody. How's it feel?

NAME: MASTER MIND
It's a...it's nice, you know? I
usually don't get a lot of
feedback.
But I also kind of caused all this.
What happens when they find that
out I was the cause of some of
this?

NAME: ROXANNE
What they don't know won't hurt
them.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I guess that is all in the past.

NAME: ROXANNE
You're the hero.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I don't think I'd go that far...I
mean I just...er...

NAME: ROXANNE
Master Mind?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Yes?

NAME: ROXANNE
Stop talking.

NAME: SAMANTHA SUMMERS
Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.
It seems the former villain has
done a career 180 after defeating
Tighten and saving Metro City from
certain enslavement. And here he is
getting a full pardon by Metro
City's Mayor, Steve Dent.

NAME: MAYOR
Ahhh!

NAME: MASTER MIND
Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.

NAME: MASTER MIND (CONT'D)
We're okay, right?

NAME: BRAD HELMS
And what about Tighten? Is there a
prison in existence that can hold
this super powered menace? Well,
the answer we found is no.

NAME: PRISON SCIENTIST
Of course normally he could break
out of there anytime, but as you
can see we've taken some special
precautions.

NAME: BRAD HELMS
What is a Hero? It seems never has
that question needed to be asked
more than it does tonight. We go to
our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making
her triumphant return to our news
desk for the answer.

NAME: ROXANNE
What is a hero? Well, there are
many different kinds. There are
those who hear a call, like the
policeman or doctor, then there's
the kind the public creates in
their search for meaning and hope.
Then, there are those who have the
courage to change.

NAME: MASTER MIND
I'm gonna give you a chance to
surrender.

NAME: MASTER MIND
Way to take out those two goons,
guys!

NAME: DA VINCI
What two goons?

NAME: MASTER MIND
Sorry, we're new at this.

NAME: MIA
...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.
It was pure insanity.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...

Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --

NAME: WOMAN
Cappuccino, please.

NAME: MANAGER
On us.

NAME: WOMAN
No, I insist.

NAME: MIA
Shit.

Where do you think you're going?

NAME: MIA
It's -- five past...

You'd better be here early tomorrow.

NAME: MIA
Ok.

And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...

Oh. I see...
No, you're right. I understand.
Ok... I just... Oh...

No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --

You know what? I think we're good. Thanks

Holy Mother of God.

Ever heard of a vent?

I wanted to give you an entrance.

NAME: ALEXIS
(appearing in the hall, 26,
eating Cheetos)
Mia! How'd it go?

NAME: MIA
Eh...

NAME: ALEXIS
Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

NAME: MIA
I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.

NAME: ALEXIS
They're the worst.

NAME: MIA
I don't know if they were there.

NAME: ALEXIS
I bet they were.
Revision                           6.

Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

NAME: TRACY
Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,
right?

NAME: MIA
Can't. Working.

NAME: MIA
Yes?

NAME: TRACY
Look, I know things didn't go well today.
There are four things in my inbox that
you're perfect for and I will submit you.
But right now -- you're coming.

NAME: TRACY (CONT'D)
It'll be fun.

NAME: MIA
It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed
into one of those glass houses.

NAME: TRACY
Exactly. Fun.

NAME: TRACY (CONT'D)                        MIA
This looks familiar.             I was going to give it
back!

NAME: ALEXIS
Come on, Mia. When else do you get to
see every Hollywood clich crammed
into a single home?

NAME: TRACY
Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's
nothing to make fun of. This party will
be humanity at its finest.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
No...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You gotta stop breaking into my home.

NAME: LAURA
You think Mom or Dad would call this a
home?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Please don't sit on that.

NAME: LAURA
Are you serious?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.

NAME: LAURA
I wonder why.
I brought you this. It's a throw rug.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Don't need it.

NAME: LAURA
Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis
pissed on it?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
That's almost insulting...
Did he?
Revision                        11.

NAME: LAURA
When are you going to unpack these boxes?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
When I unpack them in my club.

NAME: LAURA
Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with
you and you're stalking her.
You're not still going by there, are you?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
No.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
They've turned it into a tapas-samba
place. You believe that?

NAME: LAURA
Seb --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Who wants to tapas while they samba?

NAME: LAURA
I have someone I want you to meet.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I don't want to meet anyone.

NAME: LAURA
You'll like her.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?

NAME: LAURA
Probably not.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Then what are we gonna talk about?

NAME: LAURA
You'll talk about the weather.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to
meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart
of gold.
Revision                      12.

NAME: LAURA
Sebastian --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
How long's it been?

NAME: LAURA
You need to get serious. You live like a
hermit. You're driving without insurance.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I am serious. I had a very serious plan
for my future. It's not my fault I got
Shanghai'ed.

NAME: LAURA
You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got
ripped off.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What's the difference?

NAME: LAURA
It's not as romantic as that.
And everyone knew that guy was shady
except for you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty
word?

NAME: LAURA
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You're acting like life's got me on the
ropes -- what you don't understand is, I
want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life
hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna
make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.

NAME: LAURA
I love you. Unpack your boxes.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'm changing the locks.
Revision                       13.

Bill. Thanks for having me back.

NAME: BOSS
Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
Revision                       14.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Of course.
(under his breath as he heads
to the piano)
Though I don't think they care what I
play.

NAME: BOSS
I do, and I don't want to hear the free
jazz.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two
for you, one for me?
Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that
works. Good deal.

NAME: WAITRESS
Well... Welcome back.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
There's a nice way to say that.

NAME: BOSS
...every goddamned night.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'll stick to the set list, I promise --

Too late. You're done.

You're not gonna find a better player. You

Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...

NAME: SINGER
Alright, one more for y'all before we
break. Do I hear any requests?

NAME: MIA
"I Ran".

NAME: SINGER
"I Ran" it is.
Wanna start us off, piano-man?

NAME: SINGER (CONT'D)
I walked along the avenue...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Ok. I remember you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.

NAME: MIA
"Curt"?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
Revision                       18.

NAME: MIA
Ok.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician -- it's too far.

NAME: MIA
My God. Did you just call yourself "a
serious musician"?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I don't think so.

NAME: MIA
Can I borrow what you're wearing?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why?

NAME: MIA
Because I have an audition next week. I'm
playing a serious fire-fighter.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
So you're an actress. That makes sense.
Have I seen you in anything?

NAME: MIA
Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner
Brothers lot. That's a classic.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how
you can look down on me from all the way
up there.

NAME: SINGER
Sebastian. Second set.

He doesn't tell me what to do.

He just told you what to do.

I let him.

Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.

NAME: SINGER
Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you
did tonight...

NAME: CARLO
...Goldilocks from the point of view of
the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox
and Warners are going crazy for it.

NAME: CARLO (CONT'D)
...We're going after Charlize. For the
bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a
franchise. But the thing is it's grounded.

NAME: MIA
George Michael!

Did you just get your keys?

...Yeah.
Revision                       20.

The one with the green ribbon.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Shit...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Those look comfortable.

NAME: MIA
They are...n't.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Thank you for saving the day back there.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You didn't give me much of a choice.

NAME: MIA
Strange that we keep running into each
other.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It is strange. Maybe it means something.

NAME: MIA
I doubt it.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah I don't think so either.
Revision                        21.

Put the clicker under your chin.

NAME: MIA
What?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It turns your head into an antenna.
Probably gives you cancer, but you find
your car more quickly.

NAME: MIA
Uh-huh.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You don't live as long, but you get
things done faster, so it all evens out.

NAME: MIA
Oh my God.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Eh.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Not much to look at.

NAME: MIA
Agreed. I've seen better.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah,
I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride
to your car?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
No, that's fine... Thanks...

NAME: MIA
...Ok...

Night.

NAME: CUSTOMER
Are these pastries gluten-free?

No...

What?? I want a refund.

NAME: MANAGER
You're closing up Friday.

NAME: MIA
I have an audition. Remember?

NAME: MANAGER
Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.

NAME: MIA
But you said --

NAME: MANAGER
And fix your apron.

NAME: MIA
...Hi.
What are you doing here?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Meetings. Studio heads.
Revision                       24.

NAME: MIA
Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Piece of cake.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Actually it took me four hours and I
ended up running. We probably have twenty
minutes before the guy finds me. You got
a break coming up?

NAME: MIA
I'm off in ten.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.

NAME: MIA
That's the window Ingrid Bergman and
Humphrey Bogart looked out of in
Casablanca.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What's your Bogart's name...?
Is it Greg?

NAME: MIA
Yeah. Greg.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
How long have...?

NAME: MIA
We've been seeing each other for a few
months.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
I love this stuff. Makes coming to work
easier.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I know what you mean. I get breakfast
five miles out of the way just to sit
outside a jazz club.

NAME: MIA
Oh yeah?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It was called Van Beek. The swing bands
played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.
It's a samba-tapas place now.

NAME: MIA
A what?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on
history.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything
and they value nothing.

NAME: P.A.
Clear the frame!

NAME: MIA
We need to wait here.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I know. They shoot movies on my street.
"C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to
sign out."

NAME: SEBASTIAN
How'd you get into all this?
Revision                          26.

NAME: MIA
Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an
actress. She was in this traveling
theater company... And there was this
little library across the street from my
house when I was growing up. This was
Boulder City, Nevada -- every house
looked exactly the same. I was ten and
already I needed to get out. And one day,
my aunt flew into town, and she showed me
the library's old-movie section. We spent
a whole day watching one after the other.
Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.
I never knew the world was so big.

NAME: MIA
I started putting on plays in my garage.
I'd write the scripts and print up
programs, and she'd give me props to use
from wherever she'd just been -- New
York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet
off again and I wouldn't hear from her
for another year.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Who would you invite to watch? Your
parents?

NAME: MIA
God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That
would have been terrifying.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Honestly, I wish I loved something else.
I've tried so hard to want other things.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
I left school after two years to come here,
my fourth manager just dropped me, and my
last audition was for a teen soap pitched
as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.
Should've been a lawyer.
Revision                        27.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.

NAME: MIA
Well it doesn't need more actresses.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You're not just an actress.

NAME: MIA
What do you mean, "just an actress"?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You said it yourself, you're a child-
prodigy playwright.

NAME: MIA
That is not what I said.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You're too modest to say it but it's
true. So you could write your own roles.
Write something that's as interesting as
you are.

NAME: MIA
Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine
for an open-mic night. It was horrible.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong
could have played the marching-band
charts he was given. What did he do
instead? He made history.

NAME: MIA
Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make
history instead.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's
something I should tell you...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah?
Revision                       28.

NAME: MIA
I hate jazz.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?

NAME: MIA
It means when I listen to it I don't like
it.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
But it's such a blanket statement. It's
like saying "I hate animals".

NAME: MIA
I do hate some animals.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Do you need to be anywhere right now?

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Most people say they hate jazz because
they don't have context. They don't get
where it came from. All these people
packed into flophouses in New Orleans,
speaking five different languages, and
jazz was how they talked to each other.

NAME: MIA
I thought it was just Kenny G.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...What?

NAME: MIA
I associate it with facials. It's
relaxing.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a
gunfight `cause somebody told him he
played a wrong note!
Revision                           29.

NAME: MIA
Right, but it's good to talk over. Where
I grew up there's this jazz station
they'd play at cocktail parties whenever
they served the salami and cheese.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Mia. These are things you can't unsay.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-
wire act. These guys are performing and
composing and rearranging all at once.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
That's why you need to be in the space
and see what's at stake. This whole thing
-- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll
head off to cut commercial sessions or do
pit at the Pantages `cause they have to --
but when I have my own place -- my club --
they'll play whatever they want.

NAME: MIA
Your club?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm
getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
The world tells everyone to move on. Says
the music's had its moment. But I love it
too much. I'm not moving on.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
So?

NAME: MIA
Hi, I just missed a call...

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
I got a call-back!

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Really? For what?

NAME: MIA
That show I told you about.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?

NAME: MIA
Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel
Without a Cause.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!"

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You've seen it, right?

NAME: MIA
Obviously.
No.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What? You're the movie person.

NAME: MIA
It's the one I lie about.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Come on. You can't do this audition and
never see Rebel. The theater near me's
playing it. If you want -- I can take
you. For research.

NAME: MIA
...Ok.
Revision                          31.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?

NAME: MIA
Ok.
For research.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Hi, Mom!

NAME: MIA
Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.

NAME: MIA
Well -- it's not picked up yet.

NAME: MIA
First they make the pilot, then if they
like the pilot it goes on TV.
Revision                           32.

NAME: MIA
Well, no, I have a call-back.

NAME: MIA
It's another audition.

NAME: MIA
...Well when you put it like that it
sounds like a huge accomplishment.

NAME: MIA
Oxygen.

NAME: MIA
You know what, I have to go. I love you.

NAME: ASSISTANT
Mia Dolan?

NAME: DIRECTOR
Whenever you're ready.

NAME: MIA
Two options. Follow my rules, or follow
my rules. Kapish? You want to bully,
you'd best be ready to get bullied --

NAME: DIRECTOR
Thanks.

NAME: MIA
I can do it another way --

NAME: DIRECTOR
No, thanks, that was great.

NAME: ALEXIS
Mia?

NAME: ALEXIS (CONT'D)
Greg's here...

NAME: GREG
Hey... I'm parked out front. But we
should hurry, my brother just landed.

NAME: GREG (CONT'D)
Did you forget?

NAME: MIA
Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...

NAME: GREG
It's ok.

NAME: GREG (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will
be there in twenty.

NAME: JOSH
That's right -- but now we've got a
surround-sound set-up, so it's like --

NAME: FIANCEE
It's like being in a movie theater.

NAME: JOSH
It's better than going to a theater,
really. You know theaters these days --

NAME: GREG
Oh, sure --

NAME: JOSH
-- they're so dirty, and they're either
too hot or too cold, and there's always
people talking, which is just --
-- just so annoying, I mean you're trying
to watch a movie -- one second --
Hello?...

NAME: FIANCEE
Probably work.

NAME: JOSH
Yeah, I'll have to call you back.
So, yeah, we love it.

NAME: JOSH (CONT'D)
One word for you. Nicaragua.

NAME: GREG
I've never heard anyone say that. Was it
amazing?
Revision                          36.

NAME: JOSH
Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort.
It was unbelievable.

NAME: GREG
Mia?

NAME: MIA
I'm sorry.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
I have an idea.

NAME: TRACY (CONT'D)
Is that a script?

NAME: MIA
It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.

NAME: MIA
Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman
show...

NAME: TRACY
...Is that gonna happen every time?

NAME: MIA
I think so.

NAME: MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
It's one-way!!

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Keith?
Revision                       41.

NAME: KEITH
Holy shit. Come here, man.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.
We used to play together.

NAME: KEITH                           MIA
Hey, Mia.                         Hey...

NAME: KEITH
So how've you been?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Great. You?

NAME: KEITH
Keeping busy. Got a new combo.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Good for you.

NAME: KEITH
...Looking for keys.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'm good.

NAME: KEITH
You sure? It pays.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'm good.

NAME: KEITH
Let's just grab a drink then. Call me.
It's been too long.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You bet.

NAME: KEITH
Nice meeting you, Mia.
Revision                           42.

NAME: MIA
Nice meeting you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It's beautiful.

NAME: MIA
...You're just saying that.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
No... I'm not.

NAME: MIA
I don't know... Is the whole thing too
nostalgic?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
That's the point.

NAME: MIA
But do you think people will like it?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Fuck `em.

NAME: MIA
You always say that.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I truly believe it.

NAME: MIA
Fine -- as long as you sit front-row
`cause I'll probably throw up on the
middle of the stage otherwise.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'll be front-row.

NAME: MIA
I made something for you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What's that?

NAME: MIA
It could be the name design. On the door.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why does it say "Seb's"?

NAME: MIA
That's what you should name it.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Never.

NAME: MIA
Sebastian, no one's going to a club called
"Chicken on a Stick".

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name
"Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's
gonna be old-school jazz and beer and
chicken. "Chicken on a Stick".

NAME: MIA
No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.
And it's time to start looking for other
places.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them
samba all over its history.

NAME: MIA
Make your own history.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Your play's incredible.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
The whole world from your bedroom? Who's
doing that?
Revision                    44.

NAME: MIA
I'm doing that.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...Which guy?

NAME: MIA
The one who offered you a gig.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You mean Keith? He's the worst.

NAME: MIA
Why was it weird between you two?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
It's always weird with him.

NAME: MIA
He did offer you a job.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Right...

NAME: MIA
Are you going to call him?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
No.

NAME: MIA
Ok...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Here's what we know. It's definitely
Chicken on a Stick --
-- and your play is going to be a
triumph.

NAME: MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Look -- he's going to find a way to open
it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's
Dad?

NAME: KEITH
Sebastian.

NAME: KEITH (CONT'D)
Didn't know if I'd see you today.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Well... Here I am.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Where's the piano?

NAME: KEITH
Here's the deal. We've got distribution
with Universal, got our own imprint.
We're about to go on the road. We can cut
you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus
an equal share of any merchandise or
ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?

NAME: KEITH (CONT'D)
Sebastian?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah, that...that...
...sounds good.

NAME: KEITH
Let's play, see how it feels.

NAME: KEITH (CONT'D)
I know. It's different.

NAME: KEITH (CONT'D)
But you say you want to save jazz. How
are you going to save jazz if no one's
listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people
hadn't gotten tired of what they were
listening to before.
I mean, do you really think a bunch of
ninety-year-olds in a basement is the
future of the form? Traditionalists whined
when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs.
If traditionalists had their way, we'd
still be playing Dixieland.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You're holding onto the past. But jazz is
about the future.

NAME: KEITH
I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't
as good as you. But you're a pain in the
ass, man.

NAME: KEITH (CONT'D)
If it's not your thing, just let me know.
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying
to change this into something it's not.
But if you want it -- the job's yours.

Revision                      48.

City of stars...              You've never shined so
brightly.

NAME: SOLO...
Revision                          51.

NAME: LAURA
Look at him -- watch --

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Now he's going to check the other window.
Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check
again. Yep, still closed.

NAME: HARRY
Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two
want anything?

NAME: MIA
Thanks Harry, I'm good.
Revision                       52.

NAME: LAURA
Same here but I think someone's trying to
break into your car.

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?

NAME: MIA
I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...

NAME: LAURA
You should come over tonight. Harry's
cooking, but don't let that stop you.
What's the matter?

NAME: MIA
Nothing...

NAME: LAURA
You miss him.

NAME: MIA
I guess. I'm adapting.

NAME: LAURA
I got used to being alone. Growing up it
was just me and Seb. We only had each other.

NAME: MIA
He told me.

NAME: LAURA
I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met
Harry and -- we just fit...
You've changed Seb. You know that?

NAME: MIA
Do you think he's happy?

NAME: LAURA
Is he happy?

NAME: MIA
I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.
Revision                        53.

NAME: LAURA
Our dad never got to do what he wanted.
We were always treading water, he took a
job running a washer-dryer store. But
every night at home he'd play his
clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record.
So I look at Sebastian... Playing music,
getting paid for it. I'm happy for him.

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Dreams change.

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon.

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
I told you not to get me anything!

NAME: HARRY
Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess.

NAME: LAURA
No -- I changed my mind.

NAME: MIA
Hey it's me... Not sure where you are --
maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I
haven't heard from you in a while... I
miss you...
Ok... Bye...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Surprise.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
And...
(he hurries to the kitchen --
and holds up a big apple pie)
There's twenty-five pounds of apples in
it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem
but it tastes good.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I have to head back in the morning but I
needed to see you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Feels so good to be home.

NAME: MIA
Stay.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
How's the play going?

NAME: MIA
I'm nervous.
Revision                 55.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why?

NAME: MIA
Because...
What if people show up?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Fuck `em!

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You're nervous about what they think?

NAME: MIA
I'm nervous to be up on a stage and
perform in front of people. I'm
terrified.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
They should be so lucky to see it.
It's going to be incredible. I can't
wait.

NAME: MIA
I can.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
What time do you leave in the morning?

NAME: MIA
Ugh.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yep. Boise.

NAME: MIA
Boise?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You should come.

NAME: MIA
To Boise?
Revision                     56.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah, you could knock that off your
bucket list.

NAME: MIA
Wish I could.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why can't you?

NAME: MIA
Come to Boise?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah.

NAME: MIA
Because I have to rehearse.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Can't you rehearse anywhere?

NAME: MIA
You mean anywhere you are?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...I -- I guess...

NAME: MIA
Well, all my stuff is here and my show's
in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it
doesn't seem practical...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Right... I just -- we're going to have to
do things so we can see each other. We
never see each other.

NAME: MIA
I know, but when are you done?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...What do you mean?

NAME: MIA
When are you done with the tour?
Revision                   57.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
But -- as soon as we're done with the
tour we go back and record, and then we
go back on tour.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
We tour so we can make the record, and
then we go back on tour to sell the
record.

NAME: MIA
So it's...the long haul?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...What does that mean?

NAME: MIA
I mean the long haul -- like, you're
going to be in this band for a long time.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What did you think I was going to do?

NAME: MIA
I don't know, I didn't think the band
would --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You didn't think we'd be successful.

NAME: MIA
No, that's not what I meant. What I meant
was -- this band -- you're going to be on
the road for -- what, years now?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road
for years with just this record.

NAME: MIA
Do you like the music you're playing?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I don't know how that matters.

NAME: MIA
It matters if you're going to give up
your dream to be on the road for years.
Revision                    58.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Do you like the music I'm playing?

NAME: MIA
Yes. I do.
I just didn't think you did.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah, well, I --

NAME: MIA
And now I hear you're going to be on the
road for years, and I'm --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What are you doing? Why are you doing
this?

NAME: MIA
What do you mean why am I doing this?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
This is what you wanted from me.

NAME: MIA
To be in this band?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
To have a steady job.

NAME: MIA
Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you
could take care of yourself and start
your club.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
So I'm doing that. So why aren't we
celebrating?

NAME: MIA
Why aren't you starting your club?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You said yourself no one wants to go to
that club! No one wants to go to a club
called Chicken on a Stick --

NAME: MIA
Change the name!

NAME: SEBASTIAN
-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.
Revision                         59.

NAME: MIA
I do like jazz now, because of you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What am I supposed to do? Go back to
playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save
money for some Shangri-La club no one
wants to go to?

NAME: MIA
People will want to go to it! People love
what other people are passionate about.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Not in my experience.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know?
This is what I'm doing. If you had a
problem, I wish you would've said
something earlier, before I signed on the
dotted line.

NAME: MIA
You had a dream that you were sticking
to, that --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
This is the dream!

NAME: MIA
This is not your dream.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Guys like me go their whole lives and
never do anything that's liked. I'm
finally doing something that people
enjoy. What is wrong with that?

NAME: MIA
Why do you care so much about being liked

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You're an actress, who are you to talk??

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Maybe you liked me more when I was a
failure because it made you feel better
about yourself.

NAME: MIA
Are you kidding?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
No.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Wait --

NAME: SEBASTIAN                          COLE
See you tomorrow.                 See ya.

NAME: KEITH
You good for tonight, right?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...Tonight?

NAME: KEITH
Seven. The photo shoot.
Mojo.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I thought that was next Thursday.

NAME: KEITH
No. It's tonight.

NAME: KEITH (CONT'D)
Is that ok?

NAME: PHOTOGRAPHER
Put a light on the drums... I need more
fill in this corner...

NAME: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the
keys.

NAME: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live.
Piano look up, play.

NAME: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
No -- piano -- actually play something.

NAME: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
Good, now bite your lip like you're
concentrating on a solo.

NAME: PHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D)
That was good. Don't stop.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Mia!

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
I'm sorry --

NAME: MIA
Stop --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm
sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise
I'll make it up to you --

NAME: MIA
It's over.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...What do you mean?

NAME: MIA
I'm done embarrassing myself.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You didn't embarrass yourself...
Revision                     65.

NAME: MIA
No one showed up. I can't even pay back
the theater.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
I'm gonna go home for a while.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...This is home.

NAME: MIA
Not anymore.

NAME: LAURA
You remember the McKenzies?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Oh God, I didn't see them.

NAME: LAURA
Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so
handsome".

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You look beautiful.
I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.

NAME: LAURA
You were great
You're always great when you play.

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Now -- listen to me. I want you to save
for a down payment. You understand? You
need a home.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yes ma'am.

NAME: LAURA
I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...You still think New York?

NAME: LAURA
I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know,
it's exciting...

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...

NAME: LAURA (CONT'D)
Is my...my hair...?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
What...?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Wrong number.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah, well...not anymore.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I won't.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
"Casting"...?
Revision                      68.

NAME: MIA'S MOM                            MIA
Night, sweetie.                 Night, Mom.

NAME: MIA'S DAD
You want some more rice?

NAME: MIA
I'm ok.

NAME: MIA'S DAD
You look hungry.

NAME: MIA
I'm good...

NAME: MIA'S DAD
It's fun having you back. Your mom
ditches me at ten.

NAME: MIA
You took down the swing.

NAME: MIA'S DAD
She made me.

NAME: MIA'S DAD (CONT'D)
I've still got all your old tapes.

NAME: MIA
Oh God. Throw those away.

NAME: MIA'S DAD
Never.

NAME: MIA'S DAD (CONT'D)
What the hell...?

NAME: MIA
Why did you come here?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Because I have good news.

NAME: MIA
Ok...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Amy Brandt. The casting director.

NAME: MIA
I know who she is.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
She was at your play. And she loved it.
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come audition for a huge movie
she's got.

NAME: MIA
I'm not going.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
...Excuse me?

NAME: MIA
I'm -- no... That will kill me.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
That's it?

NAME: MIA
Yes.
Revision                    70.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
So you're happy here?

NAME: MIA
I'm happier.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why won't you come?

NAME: MIA
I told you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I don't buy it.

NAME: MIA
Because it's another audition!
I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do
you want to know what happens? Either
they interrupt me because someone ordered
a sandwich, or they cut me off after two
seconds, or I'm crying and they start
laughing, or I'm one of a hundred
lookalikes in the waiting room who never
has a chance, because --
-- because --

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Because what?

NAME: MIA
Because I'm probably not good enough.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yes you are.

NAME: MIA
No. Maybe I'm not.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Maybe I'm one of those people who's
always wanted to do it but never had a
chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's
like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
I can go back to school. I can find
something else that I'm supposed to do. I
left school to give it a shot, and it
didn't work out, and it took six years,
and I don't want to do it anymore.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why?

NAME: MIA
Why what?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Why don't you want to do it anymore?

NAME: MIA
...Because it hurts a little bit too
much.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I told them you'd be there at five-thirty
tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I
drive back at eight. Either you'll be
outside or you won't.

NAME: MIA
How did you find me?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
The house across from the library.

NAME: AMY BRANDT                       MIA
Hi, Mia.                        Hi.

NAME: AMY BRANDT
I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.

NAME: AMY BRANDT (CONT'D)
The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script.
Revision                        73.

NAME: FRANK
We want to build the character with you.
It's a process. Three-month rehearsal,
four-month shoot.

NAME: MIA
...Ok.

NAME: AMY BRANDT
So why don't you just tell us a story?

NAME: MIA
...About...?

NAME: AMY BRANDT
About anything.

NAME: AMY BRANDT (CONT'D)
Whenever you're ready.

NAME: MIA
My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She
used to tell me these stories, when I was
growing up, about living abroad...
I remember -- she told me she jumped into
the Seine once...

NAME: SEBASTIAN
When do you find out?

NAME: MIA
They said the next couple of days... But
I'm not expecting to find anything out.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You're going to get it.

NAME: MIA
No, I'm not.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
You are. I know these things.

NAME: MIA
Where are we?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Griffith Park.

NAME: MIA
I mean -- where are we?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I know...
I don't know.

NAME: MIA
What do we do?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I don't think we can do anything. Because
when you get this --

NAME: MIA
If I get this --
Revision                           75.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
When you get this -- you've got to give
it everything you've got.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
It's your dream.

NAME: MIA
What are you going to do?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I've got to follow my own plan. Stay
here. Get my own thing going. You know...

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz
there. And you love jazz now.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Right?

NAME: MIA
Right.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I guess we're just going to have to wait
and see.

NAME: MIA
You know I'm always going to love you.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
I'm always going to love you too.

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Look at this view.

NAME: MIA
I've seen better.
Revision                         76.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Agreed.

NAME: MIA
I've never been here during the day.

NAME: MIA
Hi... Iced coffee, please.

NAME: NEW MANAGER
On us.

NAME: MIA
No, no, that's fine.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Alright, I'm done.
Harris did a nice job with it.

NAME: EMPLOYEE
Took him long enough.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
No one touches the instruments. Carson's
coming an hour early to test levels.

NAME: EMPLOYEE
I got a check for you to sign.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
How'd we do last month?

NAME: EMPLOYEE
Not too bad.
Revision                          78.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Not too bad is great.
(taps the Employee on the
shoulder)
See you tonight.

NAME: EMPLOYEE
See you tonight.

NAME: DRUMMER
King Seb!

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?

NAME: DRUMMER
Like the desert misses the rain.

NAME: SAXOPHONIST
Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?

NAME: SAXOPHONIST
That's not Edgar.

NAME: MIA
Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.

NAME: CHELSEA
Bye, Mrs. Dolan.

NAME: DAVID
What if we miss this? What do we tell
Natalie?
Revision                      80.

NAME: MIA
We can just see it back in New York...

NAME: MIA (CONT'D)
Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off
here and get dinner?

NAME: DAVID
Alright...

NAME: DAVID (CONT'D)
This looks fun.

NAME: DAVID (CONT'D)
Come on...

NAME: DAVID (CONT'D)
Mia?

NAME: SEBASTIAN
Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle
Bells".

NAME: SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)
Welcome to Seb's.

NAME: MIA
I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --

NAME: ...KISS.
Revision                           85.

NAME: DAVID
Do you want to stay for another?

NAME: MIA
No... We should go.

NAME: DRIVER
Goddamn bugs.

NAME: DRIVER (CONT'D)
Deja me hablar.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
you comin' from?

NAME: DRIVER
I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Sure you were. What do you say we have a
look at your catch?

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.
Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!

NAME: AGENT JANUS (CONT'D)
What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
need --

NAME: KAY
We'll take it from here.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Who the hell are you?

NAME: KAY
INS Division 6.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

NAME: KAY
Really?

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
What're we thinking, Dee?

NAME: DEE
Tough call, Kay.

NAME: KAY
!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
Estados Unidos.
(Don't worry grandma.
Welcome to the United
States.)
A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
no? Buena suerta.
(Where are you going? San
Antonio?  Looking for
work, aren't you?  Good
luck.)
Es un placer verle aqui.
(It's a pleasure seeing
you here.)

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Que dices si te rompo la cara?
(What do you say if I
break your face?)

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
verdad, amigo?
(You don't speak a word
of Spanish, right, friend?)

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
We got a winner.
Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
(The rest of you are free
to go. Scram!)

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Sir!

NAME: KAY
Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Sir, you can't just --

NAME: KAY
Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
dealing with!

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
We're gonna have a little chat with our
friend here. You boys can hit the road ...
and keep on protecting us from dangerous
aliens.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
You ever heard of Division 6?

NAME: 2ND INS AGENT
There is no Division 6.

NAME: 3RD INS AGENT
Who are those guys?

NAME: KAY
I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
dollars to pesos that you're not --

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
-- from anywhere near here.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Political refugee. Right.

NAME: DEE
You know how many treaty articles you've
just violated?

NAME: KAY
One, my ass. Try seven.

NAME: DEE
From unauthorized immigration to failure to
properly inoculate prior to landing.

NAME: KAY
Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
put up your arms.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Ah, shit.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Dee! Shoot him!

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Dee, for Christ's --

NAME: AGENT JANUS
Th -- th -- th --

NAME: KAY
"That."

NAME: AGENT JANUS
That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

NAME: KAY
Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
you.

NAME: KAY
Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
calm down. If you'll just give me your
attention for a moment I'll tell you what
happened.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
some friends from out of town. The red eye
here isolates and measures the electronic
impulses in your brain. More specifically,
the ones for memory.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
holes at 40, 60, and 80.

NAME: 2ND INS AGENT
What in the hell is going on?!

NAME: KAY
Exactly the right question. And the answer
lies right -- here. Pay attention.

NAME: JANUS
Who are you, really?

NAME: KAY
Really? I'm just a figment of your
imagination.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
God, we're a gullible breed.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
alive after a blast like that.

NAME: AGENT JANUS
What -- blast?

NAME: KAY
Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
to exercise more caution before discharging
your firearms.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Especially you.

NAME: DEE
I'm sorry. About...back there.

NAME: KAY
Happens.

NAME: DEE
Didn't used to.

NAME: DEE (CONT'D)
The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
me...

NAME: DEE (CONT'D)
They're beautiful, aren't they?

NAME: KAY
What?

NAME: DEE
The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

NAME: KAY
No. You won't.

NAME: EDWARDS
Stop! NYPD!

NAME: COP
All yours, Edwards!

NAME: EDWARDS
Grand Central Station off to your left,
folks...

NAME: EDWARDS
Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
gear!

NAME: EDWARDS
Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

NAME: PERP
He's coming! He's coming!

NAME: EDWARDS
And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
too.

NAME: EDWARDS
What the...

NAME: EDWARDS
Wassup?

NAME: PERP
He's coming! He's coming because I failed,
and now he'll kill me too!

NAME: EDWARDS
Stop!

NAME: PERP
You don't understand. Your world is gonna
end.

NAME: EDWARDS
What are you?!

NAME: INSPECTOR
Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

NAME: EDWARDS
No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
again with another completely different set.

NAME: SERGEANT
Sort of a low beam, high beam.

NAME: INSPECTOR
Was that before or after he drew the weapon
which you claim evaporated into a million
pieces?

NAME: EDWARDS
After, sir.

NAME: INSPECTOR
And why do you suppose none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?

NAME: EDWARDS
'Cause some of the other officers are a
little soggy in the midsection. And they
couldn't keep up, sir.

NAME: SERGEANT
Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
am --

NAME: EDWARDS
What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

NAME: SERGEANT
What the hell is your problem?

NAME: EDWARDS
My problem is you being all up in my damn
face all the time.

NAME: SERGEANT
I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
minutes -- your best shot.

NAME: INSPECTOR
Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
Now.

NAME: EDWARDS
You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
pudgy bastard.

NAME: LAUREL
Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
believe you. I opened him up. Find me at
the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
found.

NAME: EDWARDS
Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

NAME: LAUREL
You have really pretty eyes.

NAME: LAUREL
Yes. That's right.

NAME: KAY
Some night, huh?

NAME: EDWARDS
Oh, yeah, some night.

NAME: KAY
They were gills.

NAME: KAY
Not eyelids.

NAME: EDWARDS
Who are you?

NAME: KAY
Did he say anything to you?

NAME: EDWARDS
Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
an end.

NAME: KAY
Did he say when?

NAME: EDWARDS
You're kidding, right?

NAME: KAY
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw
it again?

NAME: EDWARDS
Absolutely.

NAME: KAY
Let's take a ride.

NAME: EDWARDS
Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

NAME: KAY
It's all done.

NAME: INSPECTOR
Good work, Edwards.

NAME: KAY
You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
That's double tough.

NAME: EDWARDS
So who you with?

NAME: EDWARDS (CONT'D)
You got the plain clothes, the
government-issued wheels. Secret Service?

NAME: EDWARDS (CONT'D)
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
funding.

NAME: KAY
Nothing is what it seems, kid.

NAME: EDWARDS
Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

NAME: KAY
I'm part of a secret organization that
monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

NAME: EDWARDS
This is where we're going?

NAME: EDWARDS (CONT'D)
Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
Doesn't even sell guns.

NAME: KAY
Really?

NAME: EDWARDS
All right, you think it's worth shaking him
up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
answers.

NAME: KAY
Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

NAME: JEEBS
Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
proper authorities.

NAME: EDWARDS
Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

NAME: JEEBS
Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
work here because I love the hours.

NAME: EDWARDS
I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
stuff.

NAME: JEEBS
C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

NAME: JEEBS
H-hiya Kay, how are you?

NAME: KAY
The imports, Jeebs. Now.

NAME: JEEBS
You know I got outta that business a long
time ago, Kay.

NAME: KAY
Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
lie.

NAME: JEEBS
Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

NAME: KAY
I'm going to count to three.

NAME: EDWARDS
He'll do it, Jeebs.

NAME: KAY
One.

NAME: EDWARDS
I've seen him do it.

NAME: KAY
Two.

NAME: EDWARDS
Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
like this.

NAME: JEEBS
He's always crazy.
Take a cruise. Get a massage --

NAME: KAY
Three.

NAME: EDWARDS
Put down the gun and put your hands on the
counter!

NAME: KAY
I warned him.

NAME: EDWARDS
Drop the weapon!

NAME: KAY
You warned him.

NAME: EDWARDS
You are under arrest. You have the right to
remain silent.

NAME: KAY
Will you relax?

NAME: JEEBS (CONT'D)
Do you know how much that hurts?

NAME: KAY
Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
another one.

NAME: KAY
Edwards?

NAME: EDWARDS
Uh, this. This is what I saw.

NAME: KAY
You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

NAME: JEEBS
He looked all right to me.

NAME: KAY
A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
Who was the target?

NAME: JEEBS
I don't know.

NAME: KAY
Jeebs!

NAME: JEEBS
I don't know!

NAME: KAY
This is all confiscated. All of it. I want
you on the next transport off this rock. Or
I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

NAME: EDWARDS
Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

NAME: EDWARDS
The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

NAME: KAY
Searching for a handle on the moment here?
A place to file all this.

NAME: EDWARDS
See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
grow back.
What's going on?

NAME: KAY
Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
a thing.

NAME: EDWARDS
Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
long time.

NAME: KAY
Ever see one of these?

NAME: KAY
-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
but this one's eating my popcorn!

NAME: EDWARDS
Huh?

NAME: KAY
Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

NAME: EDWARDS
Where am I?

NAME: KAY
See what I mean about tequila? You're a
bright young man, James. Just lay off the
sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
sharp.

NAME: WAITRESS
Another beer?

NAME: EDWARDS
Coffee. Please.

NAME: EDGAR
Figures.

NAME: BEATRICE
What is it, Edgar?!

NAME: EDGAR
Get your big butt back in that house!

NAME: EDGAR
You can have my gun when you pry it from my
cold, dead fingers!

NAME: BEATRICE
What on earth was it?!

NAME: EDGAR
Sugar.

NAME: BEATRICE
I've never seen sugar do that.

NAME: EDGAR
Give me sugar.

NAME: EDGAR (CONT'D)
In water.

NAME: EDGAR (CONT'D)
More.

NAME: BEATRICE
Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
hanging off your bones!

NAME: EDGAR
That better?

NAME: GUARD
Help you?

NAME: EDWARDS
Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

NAME: GUARD
Elevator. Push the "call" button.

NAME: ZED
You're late. Sit down.

NAME: ZED (CONT'D)
My name is Zed. You're all here because
you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

NAME: ZED (CONT'D)
And we're looking for one of you. Just one.
What will follow is a series of simple
tests designed to quantify motor skills,
hand-eye coordination, concentration,
stamina -- I see we have a question.

NAME: EDWARDS
Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
we doing this?

NAME: ZED
Son?

NAME: AMBITIOUS RECRUIT
Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
honors. We're here because you're looking
for the best of the best of the best, sir!

NAME: ZED
What's so funny, Edwards?

NAME: EDWARDS
I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
the best of the best of the best of the --"
(realizing nobody is with
him on this)
It just struck me as --
Humorous. Sir.

NAME: ZED
Okay. Let's get going.

NAME: EDWARDS
Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
doing here?

NAME: MARINE
Looking for the best of the best of the best.

NAME: EDWARDS
Well, yeah, I know, but...

NAME: ZED
The hell happened?

NAME: EDWARDS
Hesitated, sir.

NAME: ZED
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany
deserved to die?

NAME: EDWARDS
She was the only one who actually seemed
dangerous. At the time.

NAME: ZED
And how did you come to that conclusion?

NAME: EDWARDS
Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
not his head. His head is that butt-ugly
bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
the girl's books were way too advanced for
an eight-year-old's. And besides, from
where I'm looking, she was the only one who
appeared to have a motive. And I don't
appreciate your jumping down my throat about
it.

NAME: EDWARDS (CONT'D)
Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

NAME: ZED
He's got a real problem with authority.

NAME: KAY
So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

NAME: ZED
I hope you know what you're doing.

NAME: ZED (CONT'D)
Congratulations, you're everything we've
come to expect from years of government
training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
have one more test to administer, an eye
exam.

NAME: EDWARDS
You! Hey, what's goin' on?

NAME: KAY
Back in the mid-fifties, the government
started a little underfunded agency with
the simple and laughable purpose of making
contact with a race not of this planet.

NAME: ZED
Now, if you'll look directly at the end of
this device.

NAME: KAY
Everybody thought the agency was a joke.
Except the aliens. They made contact on
March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
There were nine of us that night. Seven
agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

NAME: EDWARDS
You brought the aliens flowers?

NAME: KAY
They were intergalactic refugees with a
simple request. Let us use the earth as an
apolitical zone for people without a
planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
evidence of their landing.

NAME: EDWARDS
The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

NAME: KAY
Why else would we hold it in Queens?
Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
They live among us, in secret.

NAME: EDWARDS
I see. Not to change the subject, but when
was your last cat-scan?

NAME: KAY
Every six months; it's company policy.

NAME: EDWARDS
Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

NAME: KAY
Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
while we're right here.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Don't tell me we've only got that powdered
shit for cream again?

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Oh.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
For future reference, this is a better look
for you.

NAME: KAY
Any given time, around fifteen hundred
landed aliens are on the planet, the
majority right here in Manhattan. Most
aliens are decent enough, just trying to
make a living.

NAME: EDWARDS
Cab drivers?

NAME: KAY
Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
most part, don't have a clue. Don't want
one, either. They're happy. They think
they've got a pretty good bead on things.

NAME: EDWARDS
Why the big secret? People are smart, they
can handle it.

NAME: KAY
A person is smart. People are dumb.
Everything they've ever "known" has been
proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
was the center of the universe. Five
hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
tomorrow.

NAME: EDWARDS
So what's the catch?

NAME: KAY
What you'll gain in perspective, you'll
lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
You give up everything. Sever every human
contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

NAME: EDWARDS
Nobody?

NAME: KAY
You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
There.  That's the speech I never heard.
That's the choice I never got.

NAME: EDWARDS
Hold up. You track me down, put me through
those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

NAME: KAY
You got 'til sun-up.

NAME: EDWARDS
Is it worth it?

NAME: KAY
You find out, you let me know.

NAME: ORKIN MAN
Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

NAME: ORKIN MAN (CONT'D)
Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

NAME: ORKIN MAN
Takin' care of your pest problem.

NAME: EDGAR
"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

NAME: ORKIN MAN
Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

NAME: EDGAR
You know, I have noticed an infestation
here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
pond scum. So convinced of their own
superiority as they scurry about their
short, pointless lives.

NAME: ORKIN MAN
Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
'em?

NAME: EDGAR
In the worst way.

NAME: EDWARDS
One thing you gotta know right now.

NAME: EDWARDS
All right. I'm in because there's some
next-level shit going on around here, and
I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
are a couple of things we need to get
straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
the skills. So as of now you can cease with
all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
"sport." Cool?

NAME: KAY
Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

NAME: KAY
As of this moment, they don't mean much.

NAME: PASSPORT OFFICER
Purpose of trip?

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
Diplomatic mission.

NAME: PASSPORT OFFICER
Duration of stay?

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
Lunch.

NAME: PASSPORT OFFICER
Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

NAME: KAY
Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

NAME: KAY
A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
flight would get on anybody's nerves.

NAME: EDWARDS
What branch of the government do we report
to?

NAME: KAY
None. They started asking too many questions.

NAME: EDWARDS
So who pays for all this?

NAME: KAY
Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

NAME: KAY
Here. A new recording device to replace
CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
again?
This is amusing. Universal translator.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
you why.  Human thought is so primitive
it's considered an infectious disease.
Makes you proud, doesn't it?

NAME: EDWARDS
What's this?

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Don't touch that!

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
was funny as hell.

NAME: EDWARDS
Sorry!

NAME: KAY
Observation, the heart of our little
endeavor.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
This map shows the location of every
registered alien on earth at any given
time. Some of them we keep under constant
surveillance.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
public -- normal. In private -- you'll get
the idea.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Meet the twins.

NAME: EDWARDS
I gotta be honest about something.

NAME: KAY
It makes no sense?

NAME: EDWARDS
It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
from, like, Venus or something.

NAME: KAY
Mrs. Edelson.

NAME: KAY
Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

NAME: ZED
What's your jacket size, Edwards?

NAME: EDWARDS
Uh -- forty regular.

NAME: ZED
Then let's put it on.

NAME: EDWARDS
Put what on?

NAME: ZED
The last suit you'll ever wear.

NAME: JAY
The difference between you and me?

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
I make this look good.

NAME: ZED
Okay, let's see.
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
Sinalee touching down in the forest outside
Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

NAME: BEE
Humanoid?

NAME: ZED
You wish. Bring a sponge.
What else -- everybody, we gotta keep
Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

NAME: ZED (CONT'D)
Red-letter from last night -- we had an
un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
New York farm country. Keep your ears open
for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
galactic kegger down here.

NAME: ZED
Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

NAME: KAY
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

NAME: ZED
Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
don't you take Jay? This is a good one for
him to warm up on.

NAME: JAY
Yo, wussup with Zed?
"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger..."

NAME: KAY
Zed was saving the world before you were
born, son. Show some respect.

NAME: JAY
We got the use of unlimited technology from
the entire universe and we cruise around in
this?

NAME: KAY
Seat belt.

NAME: JAY
You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
people. You could be a little kinder and
gentler.

NAME: KAY
Buckle up, please.

NAME: JAY
Now did that hurt?

NAME: KAY
Makin' fun of my ride...

NAME: KAY
Jay. The button?

NAME: JAY
Yeah?

NAME: KAY
Never push the button, Jay.

NAME: KAY
License and registration, please.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Other license and registration, please.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Your resident card has you restricted to
the five boroughs only. Where do you think
you're going?

NAME: REDGICK
It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

NAME: KAY
Oh God. How soon?

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Okay. All right. No big deal.
You handle it.

NAME: JAY
Me?

NAME: KAY
Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

NAME: REDGICK
Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

NAME: KAY
Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
you something.

NAME: JAY
Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

NAME: KAY
Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
You were headed out of town.

NAME: REDGICK
Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

NAME: JAY
Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
that?!

NAME: KAY
So? Who you meeting?

NAME: REDGICK
Well, it's -- a ship.

NAME: KAY
Really? I didn't see a departure clearance
for today.

NAME: REDGICK
You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

NAME: JAY
Guys -- guys --

NAME: KAY
Doin' fine, Ace.
What kind of emergency? What's the rush to
get off the planet all of a sudden?

NAME: JAY
Help?! HELP! Hello?!

NAME: REDGICK
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
Some of the -- new arrivals.

NAME: KAY
What new arrivals? This have anything to do
with the crasher from last night?

NAME: JAY
Can you guys do this later?!

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

NAME: KAY
Congratulations! It's a lizard.

NAME: JAY
Hey, you know, it is sorta --

NAME: KAY
Anything about that seem unusual to you?

NAME: JAY
Pick.

NAME: KAY
What kind of "new arrival" would scare
Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?
Let's check the hot sheets.

NAME: JAY
These are the hot sheets?

NAME: KAY
Best damn investigative reporting on the
planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
York Times if you want. They get lucky
sometimes.

NAME: JAY
You're actually looking for tips in a
supermarket tabloid?

NAME: KAY
Not looking for. Found.

NAME: KAY
Not so fast. Walk up slow.

NAME: JAY
Why?

NAME: KAY
Part of the routine. Makes it look like
we're sizing up the situation. Gives her
time to get the wrong impression.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
smoother.

NAME: BEATRICE
Can I help you gentlemen?

NAME: KAY
How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
few questions about your visitor.

NAME: BEATRICE
Are you here to make fun of me too?

NAME: KAY
No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense
of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we
come in?

NAME: BEATRICE
Sure. Lemonade?

NAME: BEATRICE
And they said to me, "If he was murdered,
how could he walk back in the house?" And I
must admit, I was a little stumped by that
one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
It was more like something else that was
wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

NAME: JAY
Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
alien...

NAME: BEATRICE
Sorry?

NAME: KAY
Go on.

NAME: BEATRICE
Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

NAME: KAY
Did he say anything?

NAME: BEATRICE
Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
remember.

NAME: KAY
Sugar water.

NAME: JAY
Did you taste her lemonade?

NAME: KAY
Ray Bans.
(pulling off Jay's
sunglasses)
Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the
flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was
trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
the light from Venus --

NAME: JAY
Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
give her a new one?

NAME: KAY
Standard issue neuralyzer.

NAME: JAY
And that's the best you can come up with?

NAME: KAY
On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar
ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at
your mother's for a few days and get over
it. Decide you're better off.

NAME: JAY
Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked
him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
decorator or something...

NAME: JAY
Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those
memory things?

NAME: KAY
When you're ready.
Please -- not green.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Do you know what alien life form leaves a
green spectral trail?

NAME: JAY
Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
question on Final Jeopardy last night.

NAME: KAY
Zed, we have a bug.

NAME: JAY
I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
that this is bad. Right?

NAME: KAY
Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They
consume, infest and destroy. They live off
the death and decay of other species.

NAME: JAY
So basically you have a racial problem with
all insect-based life forms?

NAME: KAY
Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
five times smarter than Albert Einstein,
four times stronger than an ox, nine times
meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
around Manhattan Island in his brand new
Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

NAME: JAY
What do we do?

NAME: KAY
With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

NAME: ROSENBERG
Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
planet are terrible.

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

NAME: ROSENBERG
Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
the planet.

NAME: ROSENBERG
A bug? He must know why I'm here.

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
We think he does.
(noticing the ornate box
on the table)
Is that what I think it is?

NAME: ROSENBERG
No, just some diamonds for your children.
Do we have time to eat?

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

NAME: COOK
Table six is up!

NAME: ARQUILLIAN
To the continued reign of the Arquillian
Empire.

NAME: ROSENBERG
To the safety of the galaxy.

NAME: ROSENBERG
You can kill us both -- but you will not
find it.

NAME: EDGAR
You're right about one thing.

NAME: COP
What am I supposed to do with the cat?

NAME: INSPECTOR
I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
family claim it.

NAME: COP
Where do you want contestant number three?

NAME: LAUREL
By the wall, I guess.
What's with the cat?

NAME: COP
Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

NAME: LAUREL
What's the problem with the cat?

NAME: COP
Your problem.

NAME: LAUREL
Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
His is worse.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
Okey-dokey. Shall we?

NAME: LAUREL
Oh, my God.

NAME: LAUREL
...approximately 112 degrees at time of
autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a
post-mortem increase in body temperature.
Examiner attempted to verify result
rectally, only to find subject was, uh,
without rectum. Which can only be described
as...well...as really...

NAME: LAUREL
Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
going to need to see some ID.

NAME: LAUREL
You boys must not have much of a home life.

NAME: KAY
We watch the morgues very carefully. You've
got something unusual?

NAME: LAUREL
I'd say so -- triple homicide.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
The first corpse was perfectly normal,
except that he was broken in half, but when
I opened up the other two -- well, look.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
There's a skeletal structure at work here
unlike anything I've ever seen.

NAME: KAY
I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
other body?

NAME: LAUREL
This way, Doctor.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
This one's even stranger. I did a full
laparotomy. I started with the lesser
curvature of the stomach -- though, if you
want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal
junction.

NAME: JAY
I think, uh, we should start at the same
place you did.

NAME: LAUREL
All right.

NAME: JAY
Your cat?

NAME: LAUREL
Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't
mind.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
You have very pretty eyes.

NAME: JAY
Thank-you, but is this really the time to
uh -- you know, come on to me?

NAME: LAUREL
Hey, just walking the dog.
Feel that? Where the piloric junction would
be?

NAME: JAY
Oh, yes. Exactly.

NAME: LAUREL
Now push that aside. Notice anything
strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

NAME: JAY
Nope. All fine.

NAME: LAUREL
Doctor, they're all missing.

NAME: JAY
Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing
out is that there are no pieces of them
left. So they're intact, wherever they are.
That we can be sure of.

NAME: LAUREL
Have we met before? I have the strangest
feeling of deja vu.

NAME: JAY
You know, I was just going to ask you the
same thing.

NAME: LAUREL
Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's
already under enough stress.
This body is not really a body, but it's
actually some sort of transport unit for
something else altogether. The question is:
what?

NAME: LAUREL
By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

NAME: JAY
No, no...not at all.

NAME: LAUREL
You know what I like to do sometimes? When
it's really late?

NAME: JAY
No...

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
Excuse me.

NAME: KAY
What do you think?

NAME: JAY
Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
Undead thing goin' on.

NAME: KAY
Of the body.

NAME: JAY
Great body.

NAME: KAY
The dead body?

NAME: JAY
Not a clue.

NAME: KAY
All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to
sound too dumb.

NAME: LAUREL
Dr. White.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
Dr. White.
Dr. White.

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
NAME: KAY
You're up, Slugger.

NAME: LAUREL
Look at this.

NAME: JAY
What is that?

NAME: LAUREL
Far -- freaking -- out.

NAME: BALTIAN
Must -- to pre -- prevent --
-- contest? No...to prevent --

NAME: JAY
It's all right -- What are you trying to
say? Struggle?

NAME: LAUREL
War?

NAME: BALTIAN
Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --
What is word? Be...?

NAME: JAY
Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's
Belt?"  The hell does that mean?
Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come
here!

NAME: LAUREL
"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the
Department of Public Health, are you?

NAME: JAY
He's dead.

NAME: KAY
Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

NAME: JAY
You knew him?

NAME: KAY
One of the few I actually liked. Exiled
High Prince.

NAME: LAUREL
I was right -- this is an alien life form,
and you're from some government agency who
wants to keep it under wraps...

NAME: JAY
He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on
Orion's Belt."

NAME: LAUREL
... This make total sense. How else do you
explain New York? The other night I'm in a
cab, this guy...

NAME: KAY
He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?
That makes no sense.

NAME: JAY
That's what he said.
Didn't he? Right after he --
Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy
thing already.

NAME: LAUREL
Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid
I'm going to need to see some ID if you're
going to be in the morgue, okay?

NAME: KAY
Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

NAME: JAY
Stop that --

NAME: KAY
Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

NAME: JAY
-- that thing probably gives you brain
cancer!

NAME: KAY
Never hurt her before.

NAME: JAY
"Never hurt her before"?! How many times
have you done the flashy thing to this poor
woman?!

NAME: KAY
Couple.

NAME: JAY
Aren't you worried about, you know, long
term damage?

NAME: KAY
Little bit.

NAME: JAY
What the hell happened to make you such a
callous son of a bitch?

NAME: KAY
I took this job.

NAME: JAY
Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,
did you?

NAME: KAY
Nah.

NAME: JAY
Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in
charge of the flashy memory thing
department.

NAME: KAY
Not while I'm around, Slim.

NAME: JAY
Yeah, well you're a menace with that
thing...

NAME: KAY
We've got two dead aliens in there, and a
deputy medical coroner in need of a new
memory.

NAME: EDGAR
No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

NAME: JAY
Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around
here?

NAME: ZED
The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
psychotic episode.

NAME: ZED
Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of
stars in the northern sky...
and here's Orion's belt --

NAME: JAY
That's what the little guy was talking
about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
Orion's belt..."

NAME: ZED
There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
belt is just these three stars; galaxies
are huge, made up of billions of stars.
(switches off the laser
pointer)
You heard wrong.

NAME: JAY
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

NAME: 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ
Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

NAME: JAY
Pretty lady...

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
ever get married?

NAME: KAY
No.

NAME: SUBJECT LOST
Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

NAME: JAY
Well, it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have --

NAME: KAY
Try it.

NAME: KAY
They're leaving.

NAME: ZED
We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the beginning.

NAME: JAY
What do they know that we don't know?

NAME: KAY
Why do rats desert the ship?
Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
of Manhattan.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Four hundred.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Four thousand.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

NAME: JAY
And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

NAME: KAY
Message coming in.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Speak of the devil.

NAME: JAY
They sound pissed.

NAME: ZED
Translate that and step on it!
Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
see what you can turn up.

NAME: ZED (CONT'D)
And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

NAME: JAY
I like that.

NAME: KAY
Series four de-atomizer.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

NAME: JAY
You get a series four de-atomizer and I get
a "Noisy Cricket?!"
I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

NAME: EDGAR
That's my truck!

NAME: DRIVER
And make sure you tell them that at the
impound.

NAME: DRIVER (CONT'D)
I got worse.

NAME: JAY
Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
jewels?

NAME: KAY
Someone who's not looking for jewels.

NAME: JAY
This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

NAME: JAY
Kay! GET DOWN!

NAME: JAY
The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
from the picture! That's him!

NAME: KAY
Damn it.

NAME: KAY
We do not discharge our weapons in view of
the public.

NAME: JAY
Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
the world if we don't...

NAME: KAY
There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
plague about to wipe out life on this
planet, and the only thing that lets people
get on with their hopeful little lives is
that they don't know about it.

NAME: KAY
Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
town. We've got his ship.

NAME: KAY
Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

NAME: ZED
Containment may be a moot point, my friend.
The exodus continues. It's like the party's
over and the last one to leave gets stuck
with the check.

NAME: ZED
You sorry little ingrates!

NAME: ZED
We've only translated a part of the message
so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

NAME: ZED
Oh, it gets better... They're holding us
responsible.

NAME: ZED
Another contestant has entered the ring.

NAME: KAY
All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
need help. A professional. Someone with
years of experience in intergalactic
politics. I just hope the little prick
hasn't skipped town.

NAME: EDGAR
Where do you keep your dead?

NAME: VENDOR
I don't have any dead.

NAME: EDGAR
Where?!

NAME: VENDOR
I don't know, the city morgue!

NAME: JAY
Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry
little butt.

NAME: KAY
You busy, Frank?

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my
ride's leaving in --

NAME: KAY
Call the pound. We got a stray.

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
Hey! Get your paws off me!

NAME: JAY
The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

NAME: KAY
Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
I know nothing.

NAME: KAY
Not a thing?

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
a galaxy. They thought he would be safe
here on earth.

NAME: KAY
And the bug had other plans.

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic
energy in the universe. If the bugs get
their slimy claws on it, kiss the
Arquillians goodbye.

NAME: JAY
Ask him about the belt.

NAME: KAY
Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,
Frank?

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
Beats me.

NAME: JAY
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
The galaxy is here.

NAME: KAY
Here?

NAME: JAY
The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
and planets? How's it here?

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
You humans, when're you gonna learn that
size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's
important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
small.

NAME: KAY
How small?

NAME: FRANK THE PUG
Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked
before the flight.

NAME: KAY
Get out of here.
The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

NAME: JAY
Kay...

NAME: LAUREL
Boy, when you want attention --

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
What's this?

NAME: LAUREL
Wow.

NAME: JAY
So two galaxies have been fighting for
years. And the only people who've been
benefiting are a race of creatures called
bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make
peace...and the bugs send this guy down to
make sure the fighting never stops.

NAME: KAY
By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
galaxy they've been fighting about.

NAME: JAY
And if we don't get it back before he
leaves the planet...we're history.

NAME: KAY
We're not even history. 'Cause history
implies there's someone around to remember
it.

NAME: TONY
Thank you for making sure the bell works.

NAME: TONY (CONT'D)
What's up, Farmer John?

NAME: EDGAR
A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

NAME: TONY
And this means what to me?

NAME: EDGAR
He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
believe he had an animal with him. A gift
I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
me. I would like it back.

NAME: TONY
I'll need a picture ID, written proof of
ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
kinship with --

NAME: TONY (CONT'D)
-- the deceased.

NAME: EDGAR
Don't -- do that.

NAME: TONY
Do what?

NAME: TONY (CONT'D)
Shit!

NAME: JAY
I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

NAME: KAY
What the hell for?

NAME: JAY
Because all we have to do is walk in and
get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you
go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on
her and flash your brain ray in her face
and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
some shit. The woman's a doctor, she
doesn't need you erasing half her med
school classes. Take me five minutes.

NAME: KAY
Two minutes!

NAME: EDGAR
Where is the animal?!

NAME: LAUREL
I told you, I don't know, it ran under some
equipment! Over there.

NAME: EDGAR
Get it!

NAME: JAY
Uh, hi.

NAME: LAUREL
Hello.

NAME: JAY
I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
precinct. They brought a cat in here with a
corpse the other day, might have said
"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

NAME: LAUREL
Yes. That's right.

NAME: JAY
Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
witness in a murder case and I'm going to
need to take it with me.

NAME: LAUREL
I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

NAME: JAY
You don't?

NAME: LAUREL
No.
(lowers her voice to a
whisper)
Maybe you could take me with you instead.

NAME: JAY
Excuse me?

NAME: LAUREL
I said, maybe you could take me with you
instead.

NAME: JAY
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

NAME: LAUREL
I'd really like to go with you. Now.

NAME: JAY
And, uh, why exactly is that?

NAME: LAUREL
I just do.

NAME: LAUREL
I have something I need to show you.

NAME: JAY
Now slow down, you don't have to hit the
gas like that.

NAME: LAUREL
You don't understand. You really need to
see this.

NAME: JAY
And I will. But we gotta get something
straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
I'm used to doing things, okay?

NAME: LAUREL
Look, Stud, I don't know how many more
times I'm going to get to tell you this.
There's something --

NAME: LAUREL (CONT'D)
-- that you have to help me with.

NAME: KAY
Freeze it, Bug!

NAME: JAY
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

NAME: LAUREL
CHRIST, are you THICK!

NAME: JAY
How was I supposed to know!?!

NAME: LAUREL
What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

NAME: JAY
Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
prom date!

NAME: LAUREL
Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
shows the slightest hint of sexual
independence, men just --

NAME: EDGAR
Everybody shut UP!

NAME: KAY
Let her go, Shit Eater.

NAME: EDGAR
Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
right?!

NAME: KAY
You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
to your left and I'll solve all your
problems.

NAME: EDGAR
That's better. Now put down your weapons.
We're leaving.

NAME: EDGAR (CONT'D)
Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

NAME: EDGAR (CONT'D)
Would you care to see the fly get even?

NAME: KAY
How far you think you'll get without your
ship? If that's what you call that hunk of
space crap we've got back at our office.

NAME: EDGAR
Put the weapons down!

NAME: KAY
Never gonna happen, Insect.

NAME: JAY
It's okay, Laurel!

NAME: LAUREL
HOW is it okay?!

NAME: JAY
I mean it's going to be okay!

NAME: EDGAR
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

NAME: KAY
Damn it!

NAME: EDGAR
Take me here.

NAME: LAUREL
What???

NAME: JAY
They're in a cab.

NAME: JAY
Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

NAME: KAY
Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the
planet in a cab.

NAME: KAY
Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's
not leaving the island.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
What've we got from our friends upstairs?

NAME: ZED
Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

NAME: KAY
Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
we've got his ship. He's got to be looking
for a way out.

NAME: ZED
Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
have a galactic standard week to respond.

NAME: JAY
A galactic standard week? How the hell long
is that?

NAME: KAY
One hour.

NAME: JAY
One hour?

NAME: ZED
To keep the bugs from getting it, the
Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and
whatever planet it's on.

NAME: JAY
You're talking about US!

NAME: ZED
Sucks, doesn't it?

NAME: KAY
Pull up the locations of all land-based
interstellar vehicles.

NAME: ZED
They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
last ship on the planet.

NAME: KAY
Atlantic City?

NAME: ZED
Gone.

NAME: KAY
That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

NAME: ZED
Gone.

NAME: JAY
Uh, gentlemen.

NAME: KAY
Epcot?

NAME: ZED
Gone.

NAME: KAY
Miami Beach?

NAME: ZED
Gone.

NAME: JAY
Fellas.

NAME: KAY
Hartford?

NAME: ZED
Gone, thank God.

NAME: JAY
Hey. Old guys.

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
Do those still work?

NAME: EDGAR
You're coming with me.

NAME: LAUREL
What?! Why?!

NAME: EDGAR
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

NAME: KAY
Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

NAME: JAY
You're taking the tunnel?!

NAME: KAY
You know a better way to Queens?

NAME: JAY
It's usually jammed?!

NAME: JAY
I told you!

NAME: KAY
Jay. The button?

NAME: JAY
Yeah?!

NAME: KAY
Push the button, Jay.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

NAME: KAY
Mind if I smoke?

NAME: JAY
What?!?

NAME: KAY
In the car, I mean.

NAME: JAY
I don't care!!

NAME: KAY
Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
some people if you smoke in a car.

NAME: KAY
Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
should quit. I've tried. Never took,
though. I'm beginning to think I lack
self-control.

NAME: KAY
Well, back to work.

NAME: LAUREL
Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
me. I'm a very important person on my
planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me, yes. I'm
not trying to impress you with this, I'm
just letting you know. It could start a
war.

NAME: EDGAR
Good. War means food for my family, all
seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
of mouths to feed, your highness.

NAME: LAUREL
You're a wonderful dad.

NAME: JAY
You know how to work that?

NAME: KAY
No idea whatsoever.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Let's bag us some bug.

NAME: JAY
Oh, shit.

NAME: KAY
Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
implosion factor --

NAME: JAY
What?

NAME: KAY
Press the little green button, on three.

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
One...two...

NAME: EDGAR
You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

NAME: KAY
You are under arrest for violating number
4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
over any galaxy you might be carrying.

NAME: EDGAR
You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
few seconds you won't even be matter!

NAME: KAY
Move away from the vehicle and put your
hands on your head.

NAME: EDGAR
Put my hands on my head?

NAME: BUG
Like this?

NAME: JAY
That did not go at all like I had planned.

NAME: KAY
This guy's really starting to bug me.

NAME: KAY
Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
that ship.

NAME: JAY
Where are you going?

NAME: KAY
Getting my gun back.

NAME: JAY
What!?

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
Hey, Bug!

NAME: KAY (CONT'D)
I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

NAME: KAY
You're just a smear on the sports page to
me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
parasite! Eat me!

NAME: JAY
Hey! Come over here and try that!

NAME: JAY
Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on
your waxy, pointed ass!

NAME: JAY
What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
and fight like an arthropod!

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
you're a badass in your hive, but this is
New York City. You're just another tourist
here!

NAME: JAY
You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

NAME: JAY
Hey, Bug!

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
yours.

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

NAME: JAY
What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
'Help me! Help me!'

NAME: JAY
Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
that is!

NAME: BUG
Don't do that!

NAME: JAY
That's your Momma!

NAME: JAY (CONT'D)
Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
more than you can chew?

NAME: JAY
You son of a --

NAME: KAY
Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
have the galaxy.

NAME: ZED
I think the word's already out. Our friends
are coming back.
Got an authorized landing at Times Square.
You and Jay check it out on the way back...
And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
celebrating.

NAME: KAY
You were saying?

NAME: JAY
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

NAME: KAY
Worked.

NAME: JAY
After I got the shit beat out of me!

NAME: KAY
And I almost got digested. It goes with the
job.

NAME: JAY
You coulda told me what you were doing.

NAME: KAY
There wasn't time, sport!

NAME: LAUREL
Interesting job you guys got.

NAME: DRIVER
Damn bugs.

NAME: JAY
Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
don't have to flashy thing her.

NAME: JAY
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
hangs out with dead people.

NAME: KAY
Not her. Me.
They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
I never just look anymore and they're
beautiful.

NAME: JAY
Kay, you're scaring your partner.

NAME: KAY
I haven't been training a partner -- I've
been training a replacement.

NAME: JAY
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

NAME: LAUREL
Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
We're not even on the right island.

NAME: KAY
Maybe you won't have to.

NAME: KAY
Days. Months. Years. Always face it
forwards.

NAME: KAY
I've just been down the gullet of an
interstellar cockroach. That's one of a
hundred memories I don't want.

NAME: KAY
See you around, sport.

NAME: JAY
No, you won't.

NAME: "UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"
NAME: DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY!
NAME: MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA
And here's another one:
Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel
And a third:
Returns to Girl He Left Behind

NAME: ELLE
Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
Bulls game.

NAME: JAY
I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
planet.

NAME: ELLE
Let's roll.

NAME: MUNTZ
"Adventure is out there!"

NAME: MUNTZ
Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
of Paradise Falls!

NAME: CROWD
Ooh!
Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

NAME: YOUNG CARL
No!

NAME: MUNTZ
I promise to capture the beast...
alive!

NAME: MUNTZ
And I will not come back until I do!
The crowd CHEERS.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
It's a beautiful day, winds out of
the east at ten knots.
Visibility... unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Oh! There's something down there!
I will bring it back for science.
Awwww, it's a puppy!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
What are you doing!?!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Don't you know this is an exclusive
club? Only explorers get in here.
Not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of
goggles. Do you think you got what
it takes? Well, do you?!?

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.
She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
What's wrong? Can't you talk?
Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Hey, I don't bite.
She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all
directions.
She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
pins it on Carl.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
You and me, we're in a club now.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on, let's go get it!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
My name's Ellie.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
There it is.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Well, go ahead.
She pushes him out onto the beam.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Go on.

NAME: YOUNG CARL
Ow!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Hey kid!!

NAME: YOUNG CARL
Ow!!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Thought you might need a little
cheerin' up. I got somethin' to
show ya!

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
I am about to let you see something
I have never shown to another human
being. Ever. In my life.
Carl's eyes widen in alarm.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
You'll have to swear you will not
tell anyone.
Carl nods.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Cross your heart. Do it!
Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils...

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
My Adventure Book!
It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"
written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
You know him.
Carl smiles excitedly.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
big, I'm going where he's going:
South America.
She turns the page to a map.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
It's like America... but south.
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in
time." I ripped this right out of
a library book.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,
and park it right next to the
falls. Who knows what lives up
there? And once I get there...

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.
Only... I just don't know how I'm
gonna get to Paradise Falls.
Ellie closes the book, disappointed.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
That's it! You can take us there
in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross
your heart.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Good. You promised. No backing out.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye.

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
"Adventure is out there!!"

NAME: YOUNG ELLIE
You know, you don't talk very much.
I like you.

NAME: YOUNG CARL
Wow.

NAME: CARL
Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
Uhp, mail's here.

NAME: CARL
Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.

NAME: CARL
Hm.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
Need any help there?

NAME: CARL
No. Yes. Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Well just to let you know, my boss
would be happy to take this old
place off your hands, and for
double his last offer. Whaddya say
to that?
The leaf blower blasts off his hat.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Uh, I take that as a no, then.

NAME: CARL
I believe I made my position to
your boss quite clear.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

NAME: CARL
Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let
me talk to him.

NAME: CARL
You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a
bath, hippy!

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
I am not with him!
This is serious. He's out to get
your house!

NAME: CARL
Tell your boss he can have our house.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
Really?

NAME: CARL
When I'm dead!
Carl SLAMS the door.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN TOM
I'll take that as a maybe!

NAME: RUSSELL
"Good afternoon. My name is
Russell. And I am a Wilderness
Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge
12. Are you in need of any
assistance today, sir?"

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: RUSSELL
I could help you cross the street.

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: RUSSELL
I could help you cross your yard.

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: RUSSELL
I could help you cross your... porch?

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: RUSSELL
Well, I gotta help you cross
something.

NAME: CARL
Uh, no.   I'm doing fine.

NAME: RUSSELL
"Good afternoon. My name is
Russell."

NAME: CARL
Uh... kid...

NAME: RUSSELL
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in
Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."

NAME: CARL
Kid.   KID!!

NAME: RUSSELL
"Are you in need of any assistance
today Sir?"

NAME: CARL
Thank you, but I don't need any help!

NAME: RUSSELL
Ow.

NAME: RUSSELL
"Good afternoon. My-"

NAME: CARL
But skip to the end!

NAME: RUSSELL
See these? These are my Wilderness
Explorer badges. You may notice
one is missing. It's my Assisting
the Elderly badge. If I get it I
will become a Senior Wilderness
Explorer!
Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

NAME: RUSSELL
"The wilderness must be explored!

NAME: RUSSELL
It's gonna be great! There's a big
ceremony, and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges...

NAME: CARL
So you want to assist an old
person?

NAME: RUSSELL
Yep! Then I will be a Senior
Wilderness Explorer!
Carl leans in close to Russell.

NAME: RUSSELL
Snipe?

NAME: CARL
Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it
sneaks in my yard and gobbles my
poor azaleas. I'm elderly and
infirm. I can't catch it. If only
someone could help me...

NAME: RUSSELL
Me! Me!   I'll do it!

NAME: CARL
Oh, I don't know, it's awfully
crafty. You'd have to clap your
hands three times to lure it in.

NAME: RUSSELL
I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!

NAME: CARL
I think its burrow is two blocks
down. If you go past --

NAME: RUSSELL
Two blocks down! Got it!

NAME: RUSSELL
Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...

NAME: CARL
Bring it back here when you find
it!
Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
Okay, keep her coming... And...
stop. Stop! STOP!!
The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.

NAME: CARL
What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you
think you're doing?

NAME: CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
I am so sorry, sir...

NAME: CARL
Don't touch that!

NAME: CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
No no, let me take care of that for you.

NAME: CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE
Hey sir, I...

NAME: CARL
I don't want you to touch it!
Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk.
The worker rubs his head.    Blood.

NAME: OFFICER EDITH
Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't
seem like a public menace to me.
Take this.

NAME: OFFICER EDITH
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?
The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.

NAME: CARL
What do I do now, Ellie?

NAME: CARL
Morning gentlemen.

NAME: NURSE GEORGE
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.    You
ready to go?

NAME: CARL
Ready as I'll ever be. Would you
do me a favor and take this?

NAME: CARL
I'll meet you at the van in just a
minute. I... want to say one last
goodbye to the old place.

NAME: NURSE GEORGE
Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir.

NAME: NURSE A.J.
Typical. He's probably going to the
bathroom for the eightieth time.

NAME: NURSE GEORGE
You'd think he'd take better care
of his house.

NAME: CARL
So long boys! I'll send you a
postcard from Paradise Falls!

NAME: CARL
We're on our way, Ellie.
Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings
tied to the grate.
He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes
and smiles.
SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.

NAME: CARL
Huh?

NAME: CARL
Hm.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me,
Russell.

NAME: CARL
What are you doing out here, kid?

NAME: RUSSELL
I found the snipe and I followed it
under your porch, but this snipe
had a long tail and looked more
like a large mouse.

NAME: RUSSELL
Please let me in?

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: CARL
Oh, alright, you can come...
Russell runs into the house past Carl.

NAME: CARL
...in.

NAME: RUSSELL
Huh. I've never been in a floating
house before.

NAME: RUSSELL
Goggles.   Look at this stuff!
Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of
the open atlas.

NAME: RUSSELL
Wow, you going on a trip?
"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in
Time." You going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?
Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.

NAME: CARL
Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.

NAME: RUSSELL
You know, most people take a plane,
but you're smart because you'll have
all your TV and clocks and stuff.
Russell runs over to the steering rig.

NAME: RUSSELL
Whoah.   Is this how you steer your
house?   Does it really work?

NAME: CARL
Kid, would you stop with the --
Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and
forth.

NAME: RUSSELL
Oh, this makes it go right, and
that way's left.

NAME: CARL
Let go of the -- knock it off!
Russell looks out the window in front of him.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey look, buildings!

NAME: RUSSELL
That building's so close I could
almost touch it.

NAME: RUSSELL
Wow! This is great! You should try
this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's
a bus that could take me home two
blocks away!
Hey, I can see your house from here!

NAME: CARL
Don't jerk around so much, kid!

NAME: CUT TO:
Carl stands beside Russell at the window.    Russell's fall had
been a daydream.

NAME: CARL
Well, that's not gonna work.

NAME: RUSSELL
I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo
Nimbus. Did you know that the
Cumulo Nimbus...

NAME: CARL
Stayed up all night blowing up
balloons, for what?

NAME: RUSSELL
...warm air goes by cool air, and
the airs go by each other and
that's how we get lightning.

NAME: CARL
That's nice, kid.

NAME: RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big
storm coming. It's starting to get
scary. We're gonna get blown to
bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.
Fredricksen!

NAME: CARL
What are you doing over there?

NAME: RUSSELL
Look!

NAME: RUSSELL
See?    Cumulo Nimbus.

NAME: RUSSELL
My pack!

NAME: RUSSELL
Got ya!

NAME: RUSSELL
Whew!    I thought you were dead.

NAME: CARL
Wha... what happened?

NAME: RUSSELL
I steered us. I did!      I steered
the house!

NAME: CARL
Steered us?

NAME: RUSSELL
After you tied your stuff down you
took a nap, so I went ahead and
steered us down here.

NAME: CARL
Huh?

NAME: CARL
Can't tell where we are.

NAME: RUSSELL
Oh we're in South America all
right. It was a cinch, with my
Wilderness Explorer GPS.

NAME: CARL
GP-what?

NAME: RUSSELL
My dad gave it to me. It shows
exactly where we are on the planet.
With this baby, we'll never be lost!
Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.

NAME: RUSSELL
Oops.

NAME: CARL
We'll get you down, find a bus
stop. You just tell the man you
want to go back to your mother.

NAME: RUSSELL
Sure, but I don't think they have
busses in Paradise Falls.

NAME: CARL
There. That ought to do it. Here,
I'll give you some change for bus fare.

NAME: RUSSELL
Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.

NAME: RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

NAME: CARL
Well, we're up pretty high.   Could
take hours to get down.
Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward.

NAME: RUSSELL
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

NAME: CARL
We can't be close to the ground yet.

NAME: CARL
Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!

NAME: CARL
Whoah!   Hey, hey!
Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them
to the ground.

NAME: CARL
Russell, hang on!
Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.

NAME: RUSSELL
Whoah!
They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is
thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.

NAME: CARL
Walk back!     Walk back!

NAME: RUSSELL
Okay!

NAME: CARL
Where... where are we?

NAME: RUSSELL
This doesn't look like the city or
the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.

NAME: CARL
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

NAME: CARL
There it is. Ellie, it's so
beautiful.

NAME: CARL
We made it. We made it! Russell,
we could float right over there.
Climb up. Climb up!

NAME: RUSSELL
You mean assist you?

NAME: CARL
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

NAME: RUSSELL
Okay, I'll climb up!

NAME: CARL
Watch it.

NAME: RUSSELL
Sorry.
The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.

NAME: CARL
Now, when you get up there, go
ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!

NAME: CARL
You on the porch yet?!

NAME: CARL
What? That's it?! I came all this
way just to get stuck at the wrong
end of this rock pile? Aw, great!

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, if I could assist you over
there, would you sign off on my
badge?

NAME: CARL
What are you talking about?

NAME: RUSSELL
We could walk your house to the
falls!

NAME: CARL
Walk it?

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.
Carl considers this.

NAME: CARL
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
quickly and quietly, with no rap
music or flash-dancing.
Russell inspects his surroundings.

NAME: CARL
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those
balloons. And if we're not at the
falls when that happens...

NAME: RUSSELL
Sand!

NAME: CARL
...we're not getting to the falls!

NAME: RUSSELL
I found sand!

NAME: CARL
Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get
our house over there.
Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?

NAME: RUSSELL
Huh.
This is fun already, isn't it? By
the time we get there, you're gonna
feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.
Fredricksen, if we happen to get
separated, use the Wilderness
Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!

NAME: RUSSELL
Wait. Why are we going to Paradise
Falls again?

NAME: CARL
Hey, let's play a game. It's
called: "See who can be quiet the
longest."

NAME: RUSSELL
Cool!   My mom loves that game!

NAME: CARL
Darn thing.
C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?

NAME: RUSSELL
I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.

NAME: CARL
Which knee?

NAME: RUSSELL
My elbow hurts and I have to go to
the bathroom.

NAME: CARL
I asked you about that five minutes
ago!

NAME: RUSSELL
Well, I didn't have to go then!
Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.

NAME: RUSSELL
I don't want to walk anymore.     Can
we stop?

NAME: CARL
Russell! If you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

NAME: RUSSELL
There's no tigers in South America.
Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.

NAME: RUSSELL
Zoology.

NAME: CARL
Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

NAME: RUSSELL
Okay!   Here, hold my stuff.

NAME: RUSSELL
I've always wanted to try this!

NAME: CARL
Eugh!   None of my concern!
Beat.

NAME: RUSSELL
Huh?  Tracks?!

NAME: RUSSELL
Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
Snipe!
The footprints continue for a time, then stop.

NAME: RUSSELL
Huh.
Russell munches on a chocolate bar.

NAME: RUSSELL
Ha! Gotcha!

NAME: RUSSELL
Don't be afraid, little snipe. I
am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a
friend to all of nature. Want some
more?

NAME: RUSSELL
Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on
out.

NAME: RUSSELL
Come on. Don't be afraid little
snipe. Nice snipe. Good little
snipe. Nice...
A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.

NAME: RUSSELL
...giant snipe!

NAME: RUSSELL
I found the snipe!

NAME: CARL
Oh, did you?

NAME: RUSSELL
Are they tall?

NAME: CARL
Oh yes, they're very tall.

NAME: RUSSELL
Do they have a lot of colors?

NAME: CARL
They do indeed.

NAME: RUSSELL
Do they like chocolate?

NAME: CARL
Oh ye-   Chocolate?

NAME: CARL
What is that thing?!

NAME: RUSSELL
It's a snipe!

NAME: CARL
There's no such thing as a snipe!

NAME: RUSSELL
But you said snipes eat--

NAME: RUSSELL
Whoah!
Russell GIGGLES.

NAME: CARL
Go on, get out of here. Go on!
Shoo!

NAME: CARL
Careful, Russell!

NAME: CARL
Russell!
The bird grooms Russell.

NAME: CARL
Get out of here.    Go on, git!

NAME: CARL
Aaaah!

NAME: RUSSELL
Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's
okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!

NAME: CARL
"Kevin"?

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah, that's his name I just gave
him.

NAME: CARL
Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!

NAME: CARL
Hey!   That's mine!

NAME: CARL
Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.

NAME: CARL
Go on, beat it.

NAME: RUSSELL
Can we keep him? Please?? I'll
get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: CARL
That doesn't even rhyme.

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah it does.
Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, look!     Kevin!

NAME: CARL
What? Get down! You're not
allowed up there!

NAME: CARL
You come down here right now!

NAME: CARL
Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?

NAME: RUSSELL
Ellie?

NAME: 44.
Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the
bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
She said for you to let me.

NAME: CARL
But I told him no --
I told you no! N-O.
The bird HISSES at Carl.

NAME: CARL
I see you back there!

NAME: CARL
Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

NAME: CARL
Uh, hello?

NAME: CARL
Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.

NAME: CARL
It's nice to know someone else is
up here!

NAME: VOICE
I can smell you.

NAME: CARL
What?    You can smell us?

NAME: VOICE
I can smell you.

NAME: CARL
Hey.

NAME: RUSSELL
You were talking to a rock.
Russell points to another rock shape.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, that one looks like a turtle!

NAME: RUSSELL
Look at that one!     That one looks
like a dog!
The "rock" walks forward.

NAME: RUSSELL
It is a dog!

NAME: CARL
What?

NAME: RUSSELL
Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.
The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, I like dogs!

NAME: CARL
We have your dog!
Wonder who he belongs to?

NAME: RUSSELL
Sit boy.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!

NAME: RUSSELL
Uh-huh.    Speak.

NAME: DUG
Hi there.

NAME: CARL
Did that dog just say "Hi there?"

NAME: DUG
Oh yes.
Carl JUMPS back.

NAME: DUG
My name is Dug. I have just met
you and I love you.

NAME: CARL
Uh..wha?

NAME: DUG
My master made me this collar. He
is a good and smart master and he
made me this collar so that I may
talk -- SQUIRREL!!
Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm.

NAME: DUG
My master is good and smart.

NAME: CARL
It's not possible.

NAME: DUG
Oh it is, because my master is
smart.

NAME: RUSSELL
Cool! What do these do, boy?

NAME: DUG
Hey would you-

NAME: CARL
Russell, don't touch that. It could
be radioactive or something.
Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.

NAME: DUG
I am a great tracker. My pack sent
me on a special mission all by
myself. Have you seen a bird? I
want to find one and I have been on
the scent. I am a great tracker,
did I mention that?
BAM!   The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.

NAME: DUG
Hey, that is the bird! I have
never seen one up close but this is
the bird.
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

NAME: CARL
Yes! Take it! And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog!

NAME: DUG
Oh I can bark!
Dug BARKS.

NAME: DUG
And here's howling!
Dug HOWLS.    The bird HISSES at Dug.

NAME: RUSSELL
Can we keep him? Please please
please?

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: RUSSELL
But it's a talking dog!

NAME: CARL
It's just a weird trick or
something. Let's get to the falls.

NAME: DUG
Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh
please be my prisoner.

NAME: GAMMA
Oh, here it is.    I picked up the
bird's scent!

NAME: BETA
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What
is this? Chocolate. I smell
chocolate.

NAME: GAMMA
I'm getting prunes and denture
cream! Who are they?

NAME: BETA
Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
We'd better tell him someone took
the bird, right Alpha?
ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.

NAME: ALPHA
No. Soon enough the bird will be
ours yet again.

NAME: ALPHA (CONT'D)
Find the scent, my compadres and
you two shall have much rewardings
from Master for the toil factor you
wage.

NAME: BETA
Hey Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.
You must have bumped it.

NAME: GAMMA
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
Beta and Gamma LAUGH.   Alpha turns.   They stop laughing.

NAME: ALPHA
Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire
to -- SQUIRREL!

NAME: ALPHA (CONT'D)
Mayhaps you desire to challenge the
ranking that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning?

NAME: BETA
No no. But maybe Dug would.     You
might want to ask him.

NAME: GAMMA
Yeah, I wonder if he's found the
bird on his very special mission.

NAME: ALPHA
Do not mention Dug to me at this
time. His fool's errand will keep
him most occupied, most occupied
indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not
agree with that which I am saying
to you now?

NAME: BETA
Sure, but the second Master finds
out you sent Dug out by himself,
none of us will get a treat.

NAME: ALPHA
You are wise, my trusted
Lieutenant.

NAME: ALPHA (CONT'D)
This is Alpha calling Dug.   Come
in, Dug.

NAME: DUG
Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds
funny.

NAME: ALPHA
I know, I know!   Have you seen the
bird?

NAME: DUG
Why yes, the bird is my prisoner
now.

NAME: GAMMA
Yeah, right.

NAME: ALPHA
Impossible! Where are you?!

NAME: DUG
I am here with the bird and I will
bring it back and then you will
like me. Oh, gotta go.
On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a
boy's face. It's Russell.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey Dug! Who you talking to?

NAME: BETA
What's Dug doing?

NAME: GAMMA
Why's he with that small mailman?

NAME: BETA
Where are they?

NAME: ALPHA
There he is. Come on!

NAME: DUG
Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
prisoner!

NAME: RUSSELL
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

NAME: DUG
That man there says I can take the
bird and I love that man there like
he is my master.

NAME: CARL
I am not your master!

NAME: DUG
I am warning you, once again, bird!

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey!     Quit it!

NAME: DUG
I am jumping on you now, bird.

NAME: CARL
Russell! At this rate we'll never
get to the falls!

NAME: CARL
I am nobody's master, got it?
I don't want you here,
...and I don't want you here.
I'm stuck with you. And if you two
don't clear out of here by the time
I count to three-
Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.

NAME: DUG
A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball!

NAME: CARL
Ball?
Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.

NAME: CARL
You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?

NAME: DUG
Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so
want the ball!

NAME: CARL
Go get it!!
Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.

NAME: DUG
Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and
then bring it back!

NAME: RUSSELL
Why?

NAME: CARL
Just give it to me!
Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.

NAME: CARL
Bird.   Bird!
Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.

NAME: CARL
C'mon Russell!

NAME: RUSSELL
Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

NAME: CARL
Daah!

NAME: CARL
Aaahh...

NAME: RUSSELL
What are we doing?

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

NAME: CARL
I think that did the trick.

NAME: DUG
Hi, Master.

NAME: CARL
Afternoon.
Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.

NAME: CARL
Well, thanks for keeping us dry
anyway, Ellie.

NAME: RUSSELL
Is this step three, or step five?
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.

NAME: RUSSELL
There!
Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into
place.

NAME: RUSSELL
All done.
Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.

NAME: RUSSELL
That's for you!

NAME: RUSSELL
Awh.   Tents are hard.

NAME: CARL
Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness
Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah, but... can I tell you a
secret?

NAME: CARL
No.

NAME: RUSSELL
Alright, here goes. I never
actually built a tent before.
There. I said it.

NAME: CARL
You've been camping before, haven't
you?

NAME: RUSSELL
Well, never outside.

NAME: CARL
Well, why didn't you ask your Dad
how to build a tent?

NAME: RUSSELL
I don't think he wants to talk
about this stuff.

NAME: CARL
Why don't you try him sometime?
Maybe he'll surprise you.

NAME: RUSSELL
Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see
him much.

NAME: CARL
He's got to be home sometime.

NAME: RUSSELL
Well, I called, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

NAME: CARL
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

NAME: RUSSELL
Phyllis isn't my mom.
Carl realizes he put his foot in it.

NAME: CARL
Oh.

NAME: RUSSELL
But he promised he'd come to my
Explorer ceremony to pin on my
Assisting the Elderly badge, so he
can show me about tents then,
right?

NAME: CARL
Hey, uh, why don't you get some
sleep. Don't want to wake up the
traveling flea circus.

NAME: RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner. We have to
protect him!

NAME: RUSSELL
Can Kevin go with us?

NAME: CARL
Alright.   He can come.

NAME: RUSSELL
Promise you won't leave him?

NAME: CARL
Yeah.

NAME: RUSSELL
Cross your heart?

NAME: CARL
Cross my heart.

NAME: CARL
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

NAME: CARL
Morning Sweetheart.

NAME: CARL
We better get moving.

NAME: CARL
Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell
won't notice.
Alright, everybody up!

NAME: RUSSELL
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

NAME: DUG
Find the bird.    Find the bird...

NAME: POINT!
Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.

NAME: RUSSELL
Oh, look! There he is.

NAME: POINT!
The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.

NAME: CARL
Hey, that's my food!   Get off my
roof!

NAME: DUG
Yeah, get off of his <>!

NAME: CARL
What is it doing?

NAME: DUG
The bird is calling to her babies.

NAME: RUSSELL
Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.

NAME: DUG
Her house is over there in those
twisty rocks.
Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.   The
baby birds call from somewhere inside.

NAME: DUG
She has been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

NAME: RUSSELL
Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
you promised to protect her!

NAME: RUSSELL
Her babies need her, we gotta make
sure they're together.

NAME: CARL
Sorry Russell. We've lost enough
time already.

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah...

NAME: RUSSELL
This was her favorite chocolate.
Because you sent her away, there's
more for you.
Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.

NAME: CARL
Huh?

NAME: RUSSELL
Kevin?

NAME: ALPHA
Where's the bird? You said you had
the bird.

NAME: DUG
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have
said that, I can see how you would
think that.

NAME: ALPHA
Where is it?

NAME: DUG
Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow
and then I will again have the
bird. Yes.

NAME: ALPHA
You lost it. Why do I not have a
surprised feeling? Well, at least
you now have lead us to the small
mailman and The One Who Smells of
Prunes.

NAME: ALPHA
Master will be most pleased we have
found them, and will ask of them
many questions.
Come!

NAME: CARL
Wait, we're not going with you.
We're going to the falls!
Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.

NAME: CARL
Get away from me! Get down!

NAME: VOICE
You came here in that?

NAME: CARL
Uh... yeah.

NAME: VOICE
In a house? A floating house?
The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.

NAME: VOICE
That is the darndest thing I've
ever seen! You're not after my
bird, are you? But if you need to
borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy
to oblige!
The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.

NAME: VOICE
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
My dogs made a mistake.

NAME: CARL
Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!

NAME: MUNTZ
Well... Yes.

NAME: CARL
The Charles Muntz?

NAME: MUNTZ
"Adventure is out there!"

NAME: CARL
It's really him!
That's Charles Muntz!

NAME: CARL
Him!

NAME: DOG WALLA
Yes!    It is him! He is!

NAME: CARL
I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans!

NAME: MUNTZ
Well, you're a man of good taste!

NAME: MUNTZ
You must be tired.     Hungry?

NAME: RUSSELL
Uh-huh.

NAME: MUNTZ
Attention everyone! These people
are no longer intruders. They are
our guests.

NAME: DOG WALLA
Follow me! I like you temporarily.
You do smell like prunes. I will
not bite you.

NAME: CARL
Wow.

NAME: MUNTZ
Go ahead and moor your airship
right next to mine.

NAME: CARL
We're not actually going inside the
"Spirit of Adventure" itself?!

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh.    Would you like to?

NAME: CARL
Would I?!?!

NAME: CARL
Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

NAME: CARL
Jiminy Cricket.

NAME: BETA
Not you.

NAME: GAMMA
What do we do with Dug?

NAME: ALPHA
He has lost the bird.     Put him in
the Cone of Shame.

NAME: DUG
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

NAME: MUNTZ
Most of the collection is housed in
the world's top museums: New York,
Munich, London... `Course I kept
the best for myself.

NAME: CARL
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast
charged while I was brushing my
teeth. Used my shaving kit to
bring him down.
A dog approaches carrying a menu.    Muntz waves it off.

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh, surprise me.
Only way to get it out of Ethiopia
at the time was to have it declared
as "dental equipment!"
Muntz LAUGHS.   Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one
of the bones.

NAME: CARL
Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian
Leopard Tortoise!

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh, you recognize it? I'm
impressed! That's an interesting
story there...

NAME: MUNTZ
Hm, excellent choice.
I found it on safari with
Roosevelt.
Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.

NAME: MUNTZ
He and I fell into a habit of
playing gin rummy in the evenings.
And did he cheat? Oh, he was
horrible!

NAME: ALPHA
Master, dinner is ready.

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh dear, broken translator.   It's
that loose wire again.
There you go big fella.

NAME: ALPHA
Thank you Master.
Russell reacts.

NAME: RUSSELL
I liked his other voice.
Muntz LAUGHS.

NAME: MUNTZ
Well, dinner is served!    Right this
way.

NAME: MUNTZ
So how are things stateside?
Almost tempted to go back a few
times, but I have unfinished work
here... Please.
Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place
napkins on their laps.

NAME: MUNTZ
I hope you're hungry because
Epsilon is the finest chef I've
ever had.
Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove
the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look
delicious.

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

NAME: RUSSELL
Yes!!
Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and
eats a bite.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey!

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey!

NAME: CARL
Oh my Ellie would have loved all
this. You know, it's because of
you she had this dream to come down
here and live by Paradise Falls.

NAME: MUNTZ
I'm honored. And now you've made
it!

NAME: CARL
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

NAME: MUNTZ
No no! It's a pleasure to have
guests -- a real treat.

NAME: DOG WALLA
Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat!

NAME: MUNTZ
No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm
down...
In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey!

NAME: (CONT'D)
Shouldn't've used that word...
Having guests is a delight. More
often I get thieves, come to steal
what's rightfully mine.

NAME: CARL
No!

NAME: MUNTZ
They called me a fraud, those...
dah! But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.
The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,
feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.

NAME: MUNTZ
Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a
lifetime tracking it. Sometimes
years go by between sightings...

NAME: 68.
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives...
Can't go in after it. Once in,
there's no way out. Lost so many
dogs...
Muntz is lost in reverie.

NAME: MUNTZ
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to
take! But they soon find that this
mountain is a very dangerous
place.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

NAME: MUNTZ
"Kevin?"

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah! That's my new giant bird
pet. I trained it to follow us.

NAME: MUNTZ
Follow you? Impossible.      How?

NAME: RUSSELL
She likes chocolate.

NAME: MUNTZ
Chocolate?

NAME: RUSSELL
Yeah, I gave her some of my
chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.

NAME: CARL
But it ran off!      It's gone now.

NAME: MUNTZ
You know, Carl. These people who
pass through here, they all tell
pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"
making a map.
Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.   It
rolls across the floor.

NAME: MUNTZ
A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.

NAME: MUNTZ
An old man taking his house to
Paradise Falls.

NAME: MUNTZ
That's the best one yet. I can't
wait to hear how it ends.
Carl glances around nervously.

NAME: CARL
Well! It's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh, you're not leaving?

NAME: CARL
We don't want to take advantage of
your hospitality. Come on Russell.

NAME: RUSSELL
But we haven't even had dessert
yet.

NAME: MUNTZ
No, the boy's right. You haven't
had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
delicious Cherries Jubilee.

NAME: MUNTZ
Oh, you really must stay. I
insist! We have so much more to
talk about!

NAME: RUSSELL
Kevin?
Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he
sees THE BIRD.

NAME: MUNTZ
It's here.
He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

NAME: MUNTZ
Get them!

NAME: CARL
Hurry!

NAME: RUSSELL
I am hurrying!

NAME: RUSSELL
They're coming!

NAME: DUG
Go toward the light, master!
Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

NAME: CARL
Russell!

NAME: CARL
Get back!!
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
down! The dogs stop short.

NAME: DUG
Go on Master!       I will stop the
dogs!
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

NAME: DUG
Stop you dogs!!

NAME: RUSSELL
Help! Help!

NAME: CARL
Gimme your hand!
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
PULLS him back onto the bird.
Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds
100 feet below.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hang on to Kevin!

NAME: RUSSELL
No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
her get home?

NAME: CARL
Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

NAME: MUNTZ
You lost them?

NAME: BETA
Uh, it was Dug.

NAME: GAMMA
Yeah, he's with them.    He helped
them escape!

NAME: MUNTZ
Wait.   Wait a minute.   Dug...

NAME: CARL
See anything?

NAME: DUG
No, my pack is not following us!
Boy they are dumb.
Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
from behind a tree canopy.

NAME: CARL
This is crazy. I finally meet my
childhood hero and he's trying to
kill us! What a joke.

NAME: DUG
Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
walks up to a tree and says I
forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.
They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

NAME: CARL
Careful Russell.
The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
porch.

NAME: RUSSELL
You okay, Kevin?
Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

NAME: RUSSELL
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
The wilderness isn't quite what I
expected.

NAME: CARL
Yeah?   How so?

NAME: RUSSELL
It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
not how they made it sound in my
book.

NAME: CARL
Hmm, get used to that, kid.

NAME: RUSSELL
My dad made it sound so easy. He's
really good at camping, and how to
make fire from rocks and stuff. He
used to come to all my Sweatlodge
meetings.

NAME: RUSSELL
And afterwards we'd go get ice
cream at Fentons. I always get
chocolate and he gets butter-
brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
curb, right outside, and I'll count
all the blue cars and he counts all
the red ones, and whoever gets the
most, wins. I like that curb.
He looks up at Carl.

NAME: RUSSELL
That might sound boring, but I
think the boring stuff is the stuff
I remember the most.
They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

NAME: RUSSELL
Look, there it is!

NAME: CARL
Hold on Russell, stand still!

NAME: CARL
Look at that bird go!

NAME: CARL
Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

NAME: RUSSELL
That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your
babies!

NAME: RUSSELL
Run Kevin! Run!

NAME: RUSSELL
Oh no!

NAME: CARL
Russell, give me your knife!

NAME: CARL
No!

NAME: RUSSELL
No!
Carl pulls his house away from the flames.

NAME: MUNTZ
Careful. We want her in good shape
for my return.

NAME: RUSSELL
Let her go! Stop!

NAME: RUSSELL
Kevin!
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes
the flames.

NAME: RUSSELL
You gave away Kevin.   You just gave
her away.

NAME: CARL
This is none of my concern.      I
didn't ask for any of this!

NAME: DUG
Master.   It's alright.

NAME: CARL
I am not your master! And if you
hadn't a shown up, none of this
would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
dog!

NAME: CARL
Now, whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls if it
kills me.

NAME: RUSSELL
I don't want this anymore.
Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone.

NAME: LOVE, ELLIE."
Carl smiles.

NAME: CARL
Russell?

NAME: CARL
Russell!

NAME: RUSSELL
I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
won't!

NAME: CARL
No, Russell! No!
Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
have lost too much helium.

NAME: CUT TO:
The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

NAME: CARL
Wahhoo!

NAME: CARL
Russell?

NAME: CARL
Dug!

NAME: DUG
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

NAME: CARL
Can you stay? Well, you're my dog
aren't you? And I'm your master!

NAME: DUG
You are my master?!
Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.

NAME: DUG
Oh boy.     Oh boy!

NAME: RUSSELL
Ooph!

NAME: RUSSELL
Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -
Growling dogs move toward him.

NAME: MUNTZ
And they wouldn't believe me. Just
wait till they get a look at you.

NAME: ALPHA
Master! The small mailman has
returned.

NAME: MUNTZ
What?

NAME: RUSSELL
Let me go!

NAME: MUNTZ
Where's your elderly friend?

NAME: RUSSELL
He's not my friend anymore.

NAME: MUNTZ
Well, if you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

NAME: RUSSELL
Where are you keeping Kevin!?

NAME: RUSSELL
Let me go!

NAME: BETA
Scream all you want, small mailman.

NAME: GAMMA
None of your mailman friends can
hear you.

NAME: RUSSELL
I'll unleash all my Wilderness
Explorer training!

NAME: MUNTZ
Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.
Guard that bird. If you see the
old man, you know what to do.

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey, where are you going?    I'm not
finished with you!

NAME: MUNTZ
Nice talking with you.

NAME: MUNTZ
Where are you, Fredricksen?

NAME: CARL
Russell!
Carl steers his house to the dirigible.

NAME: RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen!

NAME: CARL
Dug!   Bring `er over!
Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to
the dirigible ramp.

NAME: RUSSELL
You came back for Kevin!     Let's go
get her.

NAME: CARL
I'm getting Kevin.    You stay here!

NAME: RUSSELL
But I want to help!

NAME: CARL
I don't want your help.     I want you
safe!
Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.

NAME: CARL
How do we get past these dogs?

NAME: DUG
Uh... POINT!
Dug points to a grate in the wall.

NAME: CARL
Kevin!

NAME: CARL
Don't worry Kevin, we're on our
way!
Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck
into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.

NAME: ALPHA
Allow no one to be entering through
these doors. Guard well that bird,
my minions.

NAME: CARL
Who wants the ball?

NAME: DOGS
Me! I do! I want the ball!

NAME: CARL
Then go get it!
Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it.

NAME: DOGS
I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna
get the ball! I'm gonna get it!

NAME: GAMMA
I got it!!

NAME: GAMMA
Uh-oh.

NAME: CARL
I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out
of here.

NAME: DOG WALLA
Master! He's gone! The old man!
He's here! He's got the bird! The
bird's gone!

NAME: MUNTZ
What?    Calm down!   One at a time!

NAME: RUSSELL
I want to help!
He manages to get his arms free.

NAME: RUSSELL
Ha ha!

NAME: DOG WALLA
He's in Hall D! He's in Hall B!
It's the old man!

NAME: MUNTZ
Does anyone know where they are?!?!

NAME: RUSSELL
Whoooaaah!

NAME: MUNTZ
Grey leader! Take down the house!

NAME: BETA
Grey leader, checking in.

NAME: GAMMA
Grey 2, checking in.

NAME: OMEGA
Grey 3, checking in.
The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house.

NAME: BETA
Target sighted.
The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy
that fires poison darts.

NAME: CARL
Come on, Kevin.

NAME: DUG
Hi.

NAME: OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!
Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis
balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.

NAME: MUNTZ
Any last words, Fredricksen?   Come
on, spit it out!
Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.    He falls backwards.

NAME: CARL
Come on!

NAME: MUNTZ
Enough! I'm taking that bird back
with me alive or dead!
Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal
the final blow.

NAME: CARL
Come on, Kevin!

NAME: ALPHA
I will have many enjoyments for
what I am about to do, Dug.

NAME: MISC DOG
He wears the Cone of Shame!

NAME: ALPHA
What? Do not just continue
sitting! Attack!

NAME: ALPHA
No! No! Stop your laughing! Get
this off of me!

NAME: DUG
Listen you dog!     Sit!
Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too.

NAME: DOG WALLA
Yes, Alpha.

NAME: DUG
Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-

NAME: RUSSELL
I can't do it!

NAME: CARL
Russell!

NAME: RUSSELL
Huh?

NAME: RUSSELL
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

NAME: RUSSELL
Hey!
Squirrel!

NAME: GAMMA
Squirrel?

NAME: OMEGA
Where's the squirrel?!

NAME: GAMMA
I hate squirrels.

NAME: CARL
Dug!
Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.

NAME: DUG
Master!
The house bears down on them.    They run to meet it.

NAME: CARL
Russell!! Over here!!    Let's go!

NAME: RUSSELL
Mr. Fredricksen!

NAME: CARL
Come on, Kevin!
Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself...

NAME: CARL
No!

NAME: CARL
Russell!   Get out of there!
Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.

NAME: CARL
No!    Leave them alone!

NAME: CARL
Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't
let go of her!

NAME: CARL
Kevin!   Chocolate!

NAME: RUSSELL
That was cool!
Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird
holds on to the hose with her beak.
Carl LAUGHS, relieved.

NAME: CARL
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.

NAME: DUG
Oh I am ready to not be up high.
Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats
softly down into the clouds, and disappears.

NAME: RUSSELL
Sorry about your house, Mr.
Fredricksen.

NAME: CARL
You know, it's just a house.
Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship
floating off over the clouds.

NAME: CARL
Ow! Ow! Ow!

NAME: RUSSELL
Look at you. You're so soft.

NAME: RUSSELL
I wish I could keep one.

NAME: CARL
Huh, where's my cane?      I just had
it here...
Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane.

NAME: CARL
You know what? Keep `em.       A little
gift from me to you.
The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.

NAME: RUSSELL
Bye Kevin!
The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
last time before disappearing into the mist.

NAME: RUSSELL
Ready?
Carl gives a thumbs up.

NAME: CARL
Ready!

And death.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
Back then, the world was divided in
two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
But over time, we evolved, and
moved beyond our primitive savage
ways.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
Now, predator and prey live in
harmony.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

NAME: ASTRONAUT SHEEP
Yeah, I don't have to cower in a
herd anymore.

NAME: ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D)
Instead I can be an astronaut.

NAME: ACTUARY JAGUAR
I don't have to be a lonely hunter
any more.

NAME: ACTUARY
Today I can hunt for tax
exemptions. I'm gonna be an
actuary!

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
And I can make the world a better
place! I am going to be...

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
A police officer!

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Bunny cop. That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
It may seem impossible to small
minds--
I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
But just 211 miles away stands the
great city of Zootopia! Where our
ancestors first joined together in
peace, and declared that anyone can
be anything! Thank you and good
night!

NAME: STU HOPPS
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
Nope.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Well, we gave up on our dreams and
we settled, right Bon?

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We
settled hard.

NAME: STU HOPPS
See, that's the beauty of
complacency, Jude. If you don't try
anything new, you'll never fail.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
I like trying, actually.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
What your father means, hon, is
it's gonna be difficult--
impossible even-- for you to become
a police officer.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Right. There's never been a bunny
cop.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
No.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Bunnies don't do that.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Never.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Never.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be
the first one. Because I am gonna
make the world...
(parkours against a
vendor's stand)
A better place!

NAME: STU HOPPS
OR... um, heck, you wanna talk
about making the world a better
place--

NAME: STU HOPPS (CONT'D)
--no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Yes! Your dad, me, your 275
brothers and sisters-- we're
changing the world.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Yep.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
One carrot at a time...

NAME: STU HOPPS
Amen to that. Carrot farming is a
noble profession.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
You get it. I mean, it's great to
have dreams.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Yeah, just as long as you don't
believe in em too much.
(finally noticing Judy's
absence)
Where in the heck'd she go?

Gimme your tickets right now, or

sheep butt.

Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
You heard her. Cut it out.

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Nice costume, loser. What crazy
world are you living in where you
think a bunny could be a cop?

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
Kindly return my friends' tickets.

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Come and get `em.... But watch out,
`cause I'm a fox-- and like you
said in your dumb little stage
play, us predators used to eat
prey. And that killer instinct's
still in our Dunnahh.

NAME: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's
pronounced D-N-A.

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
You don't scare me, Gideon.

NAME: GIDEON GREY
You scared now?

NAME: TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID
Lookit her nose twitch. She is
scared!

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --

NAME: GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do
ya?

NAME: GIDEON GREY (CONT'D)
I want you to remember this moment--
the next time you think you will
ever be anything more than just a
stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.

NAME: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY
That looks bad.

NAME: SHARLA
Are you okay, Judy?

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
Here you go.

NAME: SHARLA
Wow! You got our tickets!

NAME: GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY
You're awesome, Judy!

NAME: SHARLA
Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talkin' `bout.

NAME: YOUNG JUDY
Well, he was right about one
thing...

NAME: YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D)
I don't know when to quit.

We're real proud of you, Judy.

NAME: STU HOPPS

Really, it's kind of a proud-scared
combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so
far a away... It's such a big city.

NAME: JUDY
Guys-- I've been working for this
my whole life.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
We know. And we're just a little
excited for you, but terrified.

NAME: JUDY
The only thing we have to fear is
fear itself.

NAME: STU HOPPS
And also bears. We have bears to
fear, too. To say nothing of lions,
and wolves...

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Wolves?

NAME: STU HOPPS
...weasels...

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
You play cribbage with a weasel.

NAME: STU HOPPS
And he cheats like there's no
tomorrow. You know what, pretty
much all predators-- and Zootopia's
full of `em.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Oh, Stu.

NAME: STU HOPPS
And foxes are the worst.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Actually, your father does have a
point there. It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon
Grey.

NAME: JUDY
When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a
jerk, who happened to be a fox. I
know plenty of bunnies who are
jerks.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case, we made you a
little care package to take with
you.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
And I put some snacks in there.

NAME: STU HOPPS
This is fox deterrent.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Yeah that's safe to have there.

NAME: STU HOPPS
This is fox repellent...

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Okay, the deterrent and the
repellent. That's all she needs.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Check this out!

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Oh for goodness sake. She has no
need for a fox taser, Stu.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Oh c'mon. When is there not a need
for a fox taser?

NAME: JUDY
Okay, look-- I will take this to
make you stop talking.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Terrific! Everyone wins!

NAME: TRAIN CONDUCTOR

C'mon! He bared his teeth first.

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
O-M goodness! They really did hire
a bunny. What?!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER (CONT'D)
I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be.

NAME: HOPPS
Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny
"cute," but when other animals do
it, it's a little...

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin
Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks
is just a flabby, donut-loving cop,
stereotyping you...?

NAME: HOPPS
It's okay-- oh, you've actually

Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to
make the world a better place?

NAME: BOGO
All right, all right. Everybody
sit.

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
I've got three items on the docket.
First... we need to acknowledge the
elephant in the room.
Francine, happy birthday.

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
Number two: There are some new
recruits with us I should
introduce. But I'm not going to,
because I don't care. Finally...

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
...We have 14 missing mammal cases.
All predators, from a giant polar
bear, to a teensy little otter. And
City Hall is right up my tail to
find them. This is priority number
one. Assignments!

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer,
Delgato-- your teams take Missing
Mammals from the Rainforest
District. Officers McHorn,
Rhinowitz, Wolfard, your teams take
Sahara Square. Officers Higgins,
Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And
finally, our first bunny, Officer
Hopps.

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
Parking Duty. Dismissed!

NAME: HOPPS
Parking duty?
Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Sir, you said there were 14 missing
mammal cases?

NAME: BOGO
So.

NAME: HOPPS
So I can handle one. You probably
forgot, but I was top of my class
at the academy.

NAME: BOGO
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

NAME: HOPPS
Sir, I'm not just some "token"
bunny.

NAME: BOGO
Well, then writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.

NAME: HOPPS
100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write
100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200
tickets!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Before noon!

NAME: HOPPS
Boom! 200 tickets before noon.

NAME: HOPPS
Where'd he go...

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
Listen, I don't know what you're
doing skulking around during
daylight hours, but I don't want
any trouble in here... So hit the
road.

NAME: NICK
I'm not looking for any trouble
either, sir. I simply want to buy a
Jumbo Pop for my little boy.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
You want the red or the blue, pal?

NAME: HOPPS
I'm such a...

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen,
buddy, what? There aren't any fox
ice cream joints in your part of
town?

NAME: NICK
Uh, no no, there are. There are.
It's just, my boy--
--this goofy little stinker-- he
loves all things elephant. Wants to
be one when he grows up.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am
I to crush his little dreams, huh?
Right?

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
Look, you probably can't read, fox
but the sign says...

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. (CONT'D)
NAME: WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE

belittling)
SERVICE TO ANYONE. So beat it.

NAME: ELEPHANT
You're holding up the line.

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, metermaid.

NAME: HOPPS
Actually...
I'm an officer. Just had a quick
question. Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucous
with their cookies and cream?

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
What are you talkin' about?

NAME: HOPPS
Well, I don't wanna cause you any
trouble, but I believe scooping ice
cream with an un-gloved trunk is a
Class 3 Health Code Violation...

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
...Which is kind of a big deal. Of
course-- I could let you off with a
warning if you were to glove those
trunks and, I don't know, finish
selling this nice dad and his son
a... what was it?

NAME: NICK
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

NAME: HOPPS
A Jumbo Pop.

NAME: JERRY JUMBEAUX, JR.
Fifteen dollars.

NAME: NICK
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't
have my wallet. I'd lose my head if
it weren't attached to my neck,
that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry
pal. Gotta be about the worst
birthday ever. Please don't be mad
at me.
Thanks, anyway.

NAME: HOPPS
Keep the change.

NAME: NICK
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind, really, can I pay you
back?

NAME: HOPPS
Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know,
it burns me up to see folks with
such backward attitudes toward
foxes. I just wanna say, you're a
great dad and just a... a real
articulate fella.

NAME: NICK
Ah, well, that is high praise. It's
rare that I find someone so non-
patronizing... Officer...

NAME: HOPPS
Hopps. Mr...

NAME: NICK
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

NAME: HOPPS
And you little guy, you want to be
an elephant when you grow up... you

that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss
bye-bye for daddy?

NAME: FINNICK
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite
your face off. Ciao.

NAME: HOPPS
Well. I stood up for you, and you
lied to me. You liar!

NAME: NICK
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar, he is.

NAME: HOPPS
Hey!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Alright, slick Nick, you're under
arrest.

NAME: NICK
Really, for what?

NAME: HOPPS
Gee I don't know, how `bout selling
food without a permit, transporting
undeclared commerce across borough
lines, false advertising...

NAME: NICK
Permit. Receipt of declared
commerce. And I didn't falsely
advertise anything. Take care.

NAME: HOPPS
You told that mouse the popsicle
sticks were redwood!

NAME: NICK
That's right. "Red wood." With a
space in the middle. Wood that is
red.
You can't touch me, Carrots, I been
doing this since I was born.

NAME: HOPPS
You're gonna wanna refrain from
calling me Carrots...

NAME: NICK
My bad. I just naturally assumed
you came from some little carrot-
choked podunk, no?

NAME: HOPPS
Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke
County, and I grew up in
Bunnyburrow.

NAME: NICK
Okay. Tell me if this story sounds
familiar:
Nave little hick with good grades
and big ideas decides, "Hey lookit
me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia--
where Predators and Prey live in
harmony and sing Kumbaya!" Only to
find-- whoopsie, we don't all get
along. And that dream of becoming a
big city cop? Double whoopsie!
She's a meter maid. And whoopsie
number threesie-- NO ONE cares
about her or her dreams. And soon
enough those dreams die and our
bunny sinks into emotional and
literal squalor living in a box
under a bridge. Til finally she has
no choice but to go back home with
that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become-- you're
from Bunnyburrow, is that what you
said?-- so how `bout a carrot
farmer... That sound about right?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Be careful now, it won't just be
your dreams getting crushed.

NAME: HOPPS
Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I
can or can't be! Especially not
some jerk who never had the guts to
try to be anything more than a
popsicle hustler!

NAME: NICK
Alright look, everyone comes to
Zootopia thinking they can be
anything they want. Well you can't.
You can only be what you are.
Sly fox.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Dumb bunny.

NAME: HOPPS
I am NOT a dumb bunny.

NAME: NICK
Right. And that's not wet cement.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
You'll never be a real cop. You're
a cute meter maid though. Maybe a
supervisor one day. Hang in
there...

NAME: HOPPS
Oh hey, it's my parents!

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!

NAME: STU HOPPS
Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was
your first day on the force?

NAME: HOPPS
It was real great.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

NAME: HOPPS
Mmm. Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice. And I feel like
I'm really making a difference--

NAME: STU HOPPS
Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes,
Bonnie! Look at that!

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you
a meter maid?

NAME: HOPPS
Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is
just a temporary thing--

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
It's the safest job on the force!

NAME: STU HOPPS
Ah, she's not a real cop! Our
prayers have been answered!

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Glorious day!

NAME: STU HOPPS
Meter maid, meter maid!

NAME: HOPPS
Dad! Dad--

NAME: STU HOPPS
Meter maid, meter maid!

NAME: HOPPS
DAD! You know what-- it's been a
really long day, I should really--

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
That's right. You get some rest!

NAME: STU HOPPS
Those meters aren't gonna maid
themselves.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Bye bye!

NAME: HOPPS
Buh-bye.

NAME: HOPPS
Tomorrow's another day...

NAME: MOOSE
I was 30 seconds over!

NAME: ANGRY GERBIL LADY
Ugh! Yeah you're a real hero, lady!

NAME: HIPPO CHILD
My mommy says she wishes you were
dead.

NAME: HOPPS
(less convinced with each
utterance)
I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I
am a real cop. I am a real cop...

NAME: FRANTIC PIG (CONT'D)
You! Bunny!

NAME: HOPPS
Sir, if you have a grievance, you
may contest your citation in
traffic court.

NAME: FRANTIC PIG
What're you talking about? My shop!
It was just robbed! Look, he's
getting away! Well are you a cop or
not?

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I
got this!

NAME: HOPPS
Stop! Stop in the name of the law!

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON (CONT'D)
Whoa. Coming through!

NAME: MCHORN
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-

NAME: HOPPS
I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in
pursuit!

NAME: HOPPS(CONT'D)
You! Freeze!

NAME: MCHORN
(arriving, but too big to
enter)
Hey! Metermaid! Wait for the real
cops!

NAME: HOPPS
Stop!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through!
`Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon...

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
Bon voyage, flat foot!

NAME: HOPPS
Hey! Stop right there!

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
Have a donut, coppah!

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard
print jeggings?
(sees the donut about to
kill her)
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!

NAME: HOPPS
I love your hair.

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
Aw... thank you.

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
Come to papa...

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Okay, you're gonna have to be
patient and wait in line just like
everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay?

NAME: HOPPS
I popped the weasel!

NAME: BOGO
Abandoning your post, inciting a
scurry, reckless endangerment of
rodents... but to be fair, you did
stop a master criminal from
stealing two dozen... moldy onions.

NAME: HOPPS
Hate to disagree with you, sir, but
those aren't onions. Those are a
crocus varietal called Midnicampum
Holicithias. They're a Class C
Botanical, sir. I grew up in a
family where plant husbandry was
kind of a thing.

NAME: BOGO
Shut your tiny mouth, now.

NAME: HOPPS
Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my
job.

NAME: BOGO
Your job is putting tickets on
parked cars.

NAME: BOGO
Not now.

NAME: BOGO
Not now!

NAME: HOPPS
Sir, I don't want to be a meter
maid... I wanna be a real cop.

NAME: BOGO
Do you think the Mayor asked what I
wanted when he assigned you to me?

NAME: HOPPS
But sir, if you--

NAME: BOGO
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song and
your insipid dreams magically come
true. So let it go!

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
Chief Bogo please-- five minutes of
your time. Please...

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop
her, she is super slippery. I gotta
go sit down.

NAME: BOGO
Ma'am, as I've told you, we are
doing everything we can...

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
My husband has been missing for ten
days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

NAME: BOGO
Yes, I know.

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
He's a florist. We have two
beautiful children. He would never
just disappear.

NAME: BOGO
Ma'am, our detectives are very
busy.

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
Please. There's got to be somebody
to find my Em.

NAME: BOGO
Mrs. Otterton--

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
Oh, thank you! Bless you, bless you
little bunny!
Take this. Find my Emmitt. Bring
him home to me and my babies.
Please?

NAME: BOGO
Mrs. Otterton? Please wait out
here.

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
Of course. Oh, thank you both so
much.

NAME: BOGO
One second.

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
You're fired.

NAME: HOPPS
What? Why?!

NAME: BOGO
Insubordination. Now, I'm going to
open this door and you're going to
tell that otter you're a former
meter maid with delusions of
grandeur who will not be taking the
case.

NAME: BELLWETHER
I just heard Officer Hopps is
taking the case!

NAME: BOGO
Assistant Mayor Bellwether...

NAME: BELLWETHER
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is
really starting to pay off! Mayor
Lionheart is just gonna be so
jazzed!

NAME: BOGO
No! No, let's not tell the mayor
just yet--

NAME: BELLWETHER
And I sent it, and it is done, so I
did do that. All right, well I'd
say the case is in good hands! Us
little guys really need to stick
together! Right?

NAME: HOPPS
Like glue!

NAME: BELLWETHER
Good one! Just call me if you ever
need anything, okay? You've always
got a friend at City Hall, Judy.
Alright, bye bye!

NAME: HOPPS
Thank you, ma'am.

NAME: BOGO
I will give you 48 hours.

NAME: BOGO
That's two days to find Emmitt
Otterton.

NAME: HOPPS
Okay.

NAME: BOGO
But, you strike out-- you resign.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, uh... okay... deal.

NAME: BOGO
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Here ya go! One missing otter!

NAME: HOPPS
That's it?!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Yikes! That is the smallest case
file I've ever seen! Leads: none,
witnesses: none-- and you're not in
the computer system yet, so
resources: none.
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one.

NAME: HOPPS
Okay.
"Last known sighting..."

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Can I just borrow--
Thank you.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Pawpsicle.

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
The murder weapon!

NAME: HOPPS
Get your pawpsicle...

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Yeah, `cause that... What does that
mean?

NAME: HOPPS
It means I... have a lead.

NAME: HOPPS
Hi! Hello? It's me again!

NAME: NICK
Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot.

NAME: HOPPS
Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer
Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.

NAME: NICK
What happened, meter maid? Did
someone steal a traffic cone? It
wasn't me.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the
baby, I gotta get to work.

NAME: HOPPS
This is important, sir. I think
your ten dollars worth of popsicles
can wait.

NAME: NICK
I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365
days a year, since I was 12, and
time is money, hop along.

NAME: HOPPS
Please, just look at the picture.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle
right? Do you know him?

NAME: NICK
I know everybody. And I also know
that somewhere there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal, so why
don't you get back to your box.

NAME: HOPPS
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

NAME: NICK
Did you just boot my stroller?

NAME: HOPPS
Nicholas Wilde, you are under
arrest.

NAME: NICK
For what? Howting your feewings?

NAME: HOPPS
Felony tax evasion.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days
a year... since you were 12, that's
two decades, so times twenty...

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
...which is one million four-
hundred sixty thousand-- I think, I
mean I am just a dumb bunny, but we
are good at multiplying-- anyway,
according to your tax forms...
...you reported let me see here:
zero. Unfortunately, lying on a
federal form is a punishable
offense. Five years jail time.

NAME: NICK
Well, it's my word against yours.

NAME: NICK (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER) (CONT'D)
"200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a
year, since I was 12."

NAME: HOPPS
Actually, it's your word against
yours. And if you want this pen,
you're going to help me find this
poor missing otter or the only
place you'll be selling popsicles
is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

NAME: FINNICK
She hustled you.
She hustled you good! You're a cop
now Nick, you're gonna need one of
these! Have fun working with the
fuzz!

NAME: HOPPS
Start talking.

NAME: NICK
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

NAME: HOPPS
Great, let's go.

NAME: NICK
It's not exactly a place for a cute
little bunny.

NAME: HOPPS
Don't call me cute.
Get in the car.

NAME: NICK
Okay. You're the boss.

NAME: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm.
Oooooooooooohmmmmmm.

NAME: HOPPS
Hi, hello.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Um, hello? Hello? HELLO?!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Hello! My name is--

NAME: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there, `cause
we're all good on Bunny Scout
Cookies.

NAME: HOPPS
Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton. Right here--
--who may have frequented this
establishment.

NAME: AH-CHOO!
Yeah, Ol' Emmitt! Haven't seen him
in a couple weeks. But hey, you
should talk to his yoga instructor,
I'd be happy to take you back.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, thank you so much, I'd
appreciate that more than you can
imagine. It would be such a big--
You are naked!

NAME: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
Huh? Oh for sure, we're a
naturalist club.

NAME: NICK
Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be
anything. These guys... they be
naked.

NAME: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
Nangi's just on the other side of
the pleasure pool.

NAME: NICK
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because, if so, there's no shame in
calling it quits.

NAME: HOPPS
Yes there is.

NAME: NICK
Boy, that's the spirit.

NAME: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK
Yeah, some mammals say the
naturalist life is weird, but you
know what I say is weird? Clothes
on animals! Here we go.

NAME: YAX THE HIPPIE YAK (CONT'D)
As you can see, Nangi's an
elephant, so she'll totally
remember everything. Hey Nangi,
these dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the Otter.

NAME: NANGI
Who?

NAME: YAX
Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like 6 years?

NAME: NANGI
I have no memory of this beaver.

NAME: JUDY
He's an otter actually.

NAME: YAX
He was here a couple Wednesdays
ago. `Member?

NAME: NANGI
Nope.

NAME: YAX
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable-
knit sweater vest, and new pair of
corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley
tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real
tight. Remember that Nangi?

NAME: NANGI
No.

NAME: YAX
Yeah, and we both walked him out
and he got into this big ol' white
car with a silver trim? Needed a
tune up. The third cylinder wasn't
firing. `Member that, Nangi?

NAME: NANGI
Nope.

NAME: HOPPS
You didn't happen to catch the
license plate number, did you?

NAME: YAX
Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03.

NAME: HOPPS
0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great
info, thank you.

NAME: YAX
Told ya Nangi has a mind like a
steel trap. I wish I had a memory
like an elephant.

NAME: NICK
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome
for the clue. And seeing as how any
moron can run a plate, I will take
that pen and bid you adieu.

NAME: HOPPS
The plate... I can't run a plate...
I'm not in the system yet.

NAME: NICK
Give me the pen please.

NAME: HOPPS
What was it you said? "Any moron
can run a plate?" Gosh... if only
there were a moron around who were
up to the task...

NAME: NICK
Rabbit, I did what you asked, you
can't keep me on the hook forever.

NAME: HOPPS
Not forever. Why, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case. So
can you run the plate or not?

NAME: NICK
Actually, I just remembered I have
a pal at the DMV...

NAME: NICK
Flash is the fastest guy in there,
you need something done, he's on
it.

NAME: HOPPS
I hope so, we are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.
Wait. They're all sloths?!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
You said this was going to be
quick!

NAME: NICK
What? Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I
thought in Zootopia anyone could be
anything.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see ya.

NAME: FLASH
Nice to...
see you...
too.

NAME: NICK
Hey Flash, I'd love ya to meet my
friend-- uh, darlin' I've forgotten
your name.

NAME: HOPPS
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are ya?

NAME: FLASH
I am... doing... just...

NAME: HOPPS
Fine?

NAME: FLASH
...as well... as... I can... be.
What...

NAME: NICK
Hang in there.

NAME: FLASH
...can I... do...

NAME: HOPPS
Well, I was hoping you could run a
plate--

NAME: FLASH
For you...

NAME: HOPPS
Well, I was hoping you could--

NAME: FLASH
...today.

NAME: HOPPS
Well, I was hoping you could run a
plate for us. We are in a really
big hurry.

NAME: FLASH
Sure.    What's the... plate...

NAME: FLASH
...Number?

NAME: FLASH
NAME: HOPPS
Mmhmm. 0, 3.

NAME: NICK
Hey Flash, wanna hear a joke?

NAME: HOPPS
No!

NAME: FLASH
Sure.

NAME: NICK
What do you call a three humped
camel?

NAME: FLASH
I don't... know...
What... do... you call... a...

NAME: HOPPS
Three humped camel.

NAME: FLASH
Three humped... camel?

NAME: NICK
Pregnant.

NAME: FLASH
Ha... ha... ha... ha...

NAME: HOPPS
Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny,
can we please just focus on the
task--

NAME: FLASH
Hey... Priscilla...

NAME: HOPPS
Oh no!

NAME: PRISCILLA
Yes... Flash?

NAME: FLASH
What... do...

NAME: HOPPS
No!

NAME: FLASH
You call... a...

NAME: HOPPS
A three humped camel? Pregnant!
Okay, great, we got it, please just-

NAME: FLASH
Three... humped...

NAME: HOPPS
Aggggggghhhhhhh--

NAME: FLASH
Here...

NAME: HOPPS
Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you!

NAME: FLASH
You... go.

NAME: HOPPS
29THD03-- it's registered to...
Tundratown Limo Service? A limo
took Otterton, and the limo's in
Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown!

NAME: NICK
Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I
owe ya.

NAME: HOPPS
Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour
and--

NAME: HOPPS
Closed. Great.

NAME: NICK
Mm. And I will betcha you don't
have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn
it. It's a bummer.

NAME: HOPPS
You wasted the day on purpose.

NAME: NICK
Madam, I have a fake badge. I would
never impede your pretend
investigation.

NAME: HOPPS
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see--
(showing picture of
Otterton)
See him? This otter is missing.

NAME: NICK
Well then they should have gotten a
real cop to find him.

NAME: HOPPS
What is your problem? Does seeing
me fail somehow make you feel
better about your own sad,
miserable life?

NAME: NICK
It does. One hundred percent.
Now... since you're sans warrant, I
guess we're done?

NAME: HOPPS
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

NAME: NICK
Hey!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
First off, you throw like a bunny,
second, you're a very sore loser.
See ya later, Officer Fluff, so sad
this is over, I wish I could've
helped more.

NAME: HOPPS
The thing is, you don't need a
warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty
low-life climbing the fence, so
you're helping plenty. Come on.

NAME: HOPPS
29THD03... this is it.

NAME: HOPPS
Polar bear fur.

NAME: NICK
NAME: HOPPS
What? What?!

NAME: NICK
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!
But on CD? Who still uses CDs?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Carrots...? If your otter was
here... he had a very bad day.

NAME: HOPPS
Those are... claw marks. You ever
seen anything like this?

NAME: NICK
No.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, wait. Look.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He
was definitely here. What do you
think happened?

NAME: NICK
Well, now wait a minute...
Polar bear fur... Rat Pack music...
fancy cup...
I know whose car this is. We gotta
go!

NAME: HOPPS
Why? Whose car is it?

NAME: NICK
The most feared crime boss in
Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big
and he does not like me, so we
gotta go!

NAME: HOPPS
I'm not leaving, this is a crime
scene.

NAME: NICK
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me
here, so we're leaving right now!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Raymond! And, is that Kevin?! Long
time no see. And speaking of no
see, how about you forget you saw
me? Huh? For old time's sake?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
That's a no.

NAME: HOPPS
What did you do that made Mr. Big
so mad at you?

NAME: NICK
I uh, I may have sold him a very
expensive wool rug... that was made
from the fur of a... skunk's butt.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

NAME: HOPPS
Is that Mr. Big?

NAME: NICK
No.

NAME: HOPPS
What about him? Is that him?

NAME: NICK
No.

NAME: HOPPS
That's gotta be him.

NAME: NICK
Stop talking stop talking stop
talking--

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple
misunder-

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
This is a simple misunderstanding.

NAME: MR. BIG
You come here unannounced... on the
day my daughter is to be married?

NAME: NICK
Well actually we were brought here
against our will, so...
Point is, I did not know it was
your car, and I certainly did not
know about your daughter's wedding.

NAME: MR. BIG
I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed
you into my home... we broke bread
together... Gram-mama made you her
cannoli. And how did you repay my
generosity? With a rug... made from
the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt
rug. You disrespected me. You
disrespected my gram-mama who I
buried in that skunk butt rug. I
told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are,
snooping around with this...
What are you, a performer? What's
with the costume?

NAME: HOPPS
Sir, I am a c--

NAME: NICK
Mime! She is a mime. This mime,
cannot speak. You can't speak if
you're a mime.

NAME: HOPPS
No. I am a cop. And I'm on the
Emmitt Otterton case, and my
evidence puts him in your car, so
intimidate me all you want, I'm
going to find out what you did to
that otter if it's the last thing I
do.

NAME: MR. BIG
Then I have only one request: say
hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em!

NAME: NICK
Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm
not saying nothing--

NAME: MR. BIG
And you never will--

NAME: NICK
Please! No no no! If you're mad at
me about the rug I've got more
rugs!

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance.
(sees them trying to kill
Nick)
What did we say? No icing anyone at
my wedding!

NAME: MR. BIG
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.
Ice `em.

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that
saved my life yesterday. From that
giant donut.

NAME: MR. BIG
This bunny?

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
Yeah. Hi!

NAME: HOPPS
Hi.
I love your dress.

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
Aw, thank you.

NAME: MR. BIG
Put `em down.
You have done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter. I
will take your kindness... and pay
it forward.

NAME: MR. BIG
Otterton is my florist. He's like a
part of the family. He had
something important he wanted to
discuss. That's why I sent that car
to pick him up. But he never
arrived.

NAME: HOPPS
Because he was attacked.

NAME: MR. BIG
No... he attacked.

NAME: HOPPS
Otterton?

NAME: MR. BIG
Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up
the car, scared my driver half to
death and disappeared into the
night.

NAME: HOPPS
He's a sweet little otter.

NAME: MR. BIG
My child, we may be evolved... but
deep down we are still animals.

NAME: HOPPS
Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We
just want to know what happened to
Emmitt Otterton.

NAME: NICK
Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?

NAME: HOPPS
What... happened?

NAME: MANCHAS
There was no warning, he just kept
yelling about the "night howlers."
Over and over, "the night
howlers..."

NAME: NICK
Oh. So you know about the night
howlers too? Good, good, good.
Because the night howlers are
exactly what we are here to talk
about.
Right?

NAME: HOPPS
Yep. So, uh, you just open the door
and tell us what you know and we
will tell you what we know. Okay?

NAME: MANCHAS
Okay.

NAME: HOPPS
Clever fox.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Mr. Manchas?

NAME: NICK
Buddy?

NAME: HOPPS
Are you... okay?

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Run. RUN!

NAME: NICK
What is wrong with him?!

NAME: HOPPS
I don't know!!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Jump!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Head down!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Are you familiar with Gazelle?
Greatest singer of our lifetime--
angel with horns-- okay, hold on,
keep watching. Who's that beside
her? Who is it?

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real! It's not. It's
just a new app.
(finally notices ringing
phone)
Hold on a second--

NAME: CLAWHAUSER!
NAME: HOPPS
Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a
10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and
Tu-junja!

NAME: NICK
It's Tujunga!

NAME: HOPPS
There! Head to the skytrams!

NAME: NICK
Get in! Carrots? Carrots!

NAME: HOPPS
Go!

NAME: NICK
No, no, no!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Buddy, one predator to another--                      *

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Now, I can tell you're a little
tense, so I'm just gonna give you a
little personal space--

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let
go!

NAME: HOPPS
I'm gonna let go!

NAME: NICK
No, you what? No, I said-- listen--
noooo!

NAME: HOPPS
One, two--

NAME: NICK
Carrots. You saved my life.

NAME: HOPPS
NAME: ZP...
Well. That's what we do at the
Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....

NAME: BOGO
Well, this should be good.

NAME: HOPPS
I thought this was just a missing
mammal case, but it's way bigger.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Mr. Otterton did not just
disappear. I believe he and this
jaguar, they... went savage, Sir.

NAME: BOGO
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't go savage.

NAME: HOPPS
I thought so too, `til I saw this:

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
What? He was right here...

NAME: BOGO
The "savage" jaguar.

NAME: HOPPS
Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost
killed us.

NAME: BOGO
Or maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.
Let's go.

NAME: HOPPS
Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one
who saw him!
Nick!

NAME: BOGO
You think I'm going to believe a
fox?

NAME: HOPPS
Well he was a key witness and I
enlisted--

NAME: BOGO
Two days to find the otter...

NAME: BOGO (CONT'D)
or you quit... that was the deal.
Badge.

NAME: HOPPS
But, Sir, we...

NAME: BOGO
Badge.

NAME: BOGO
What did you say, fox?

NAME: NICK
Sorry, what I said was, "no." She
will not be giving you that badge.
Look, you gave her a clown vest and
a three-wheel joke-mobile and two
days to solve a case you guys
haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah,
no wonder she needed to get help
from a fox, none of you guys were
gonna help her, were you?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Here's the thing Chief, you gave
her the 48 hours, so technically we
still have 10 left to find our Mr.
Otterton... and that's exactly what
we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse
us... we have a very big lead to
follow and a case to crack. Good
day.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Officer Hopps?

NAME: HOPPS
Thank you.

NAME: NICK
Never let `em see that they get to
you.

NAME: HOPPS
So, things do get to you...

NAME: NICK
No... I mean, not anymore. But I
was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

NAME: HOPPS
Har-har.

NAME: NICK
(retreating into the
memory)
No, it's true. I think was 8, or
maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was
join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

NAME: MEAN KID ANIMAL
Ready for initiation?

NAME: YOUNG NICK
Yeah! Pretty much born ready.

NAME: MEAN KID ANIMAL
Okay. Now raise your right hand and
deliver the oath.

NAME: YOUNG NICK
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be
brave, loyal, helpful, and
trustworthy.

NAME: MEAN KID ANIMAL
Even though you're a fox?

NAME: YOUNG NICK
What?

NAME: YOUNG NICK (CONT'D)
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?!
No! Please tell me, what did I do
wrong?!

NAME: YOUNG NICK (CONT'D)
What did I do?!

NAME: MEAN KID ANIMAL
If you thought we would ever trust
a fox without a muzzle, you're even
dumber than you look.

NAME: MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Aw, is he gonna cry?

NAME: NICK
I learned two things that day. One,
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

NAME: HOPPS
...And two?

NAME: NICK
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy,
there's no point in trying to be
anything else.

NAME: HOPPS
Nick, you are so much more than
that...

NAME: NICK
Boy, look at that traffic down
there.
How about we go out to Chuck in
Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are
things looking on the Jam Cams?

NAME: HOPPS
Nick, I'm glad you told me...

NAME: NICK
The Jam Cams...!

NAME: HOPPS
Seriously, it's okay...

NAME: NICK
No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic
cameras everywhere. All over the
canopy. Whatever happened to that
jaguar--

NAME: HOPPS
The traffic cams would have caught
it!

NAME: NICK
Bingo!

NAME: HOPPS
Pretty sneaky, Slick.

NAME: NICK
However. If you didn't have access
to the system before, I doubt Chief
Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into
it now.

NAME: HOPPS
No... But I have a friend at City
Hall who might.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Sir? If we could just review these
very important--
Sir?

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?!

NAME: LIONHEART
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just
take care of it!
(setting another binder
atop her stack)
Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm
going out.

NAME: BELLWETHER
No, no! But, sir, you do have a
meeting with Herds and Grazing...
sir, if I could just--

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Oh, mutton chops.

NAME: HOPPS
Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need
your help.

NAME: HOPPS
We just need to get into the
traffic cam database.

NAME: NICK
So fluffy!

NAME: HOPPS
Hey!

NAME: NICK
Sheep never let me this close.

NAME: HOPPS
You can't just touch a sheep's
wool...

NAME: NICK                          HOPPS (CONT'D)
It's like cotton candy.            Stop it!

NAME: BELLWETHER
Where to?

NAME: HOPPS
Rainforest District, Vine and
Tujunga.

NAME: BELLWETHER
There! Traffic cams for the whole
city. This is so exciting,
actually. Well, you know, I never
get to do anything this important.

NAME: HOPPS
But you're the Assistant Mayor of
Zootopia.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Oh, I'm more of a glorified
secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote...
But he did give me that nice mug.

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Feels good to be appreciated.

NAME: BELLWETHER
That's a fun little name he likes
to use. I called him Lionfart once.
He did not care for that, let me
tell you. It was not a good day for
me.
Yes, sir?

NAME: BELLWETHER
Oh, dear. I better go --
Let me know what you find. It was
really nice for me to be--

NAME: NICK
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

NAME: HOPPS
Shush. Okay, traffic cams...
Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Who are these guys?

NAME: NICK
Timberwolves. Look at these
dumdums.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna
howl.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
And there it is. What is it with
wolves and the howling? It's like--

NAME: HOPPS
Howlers! Night howlers! That's what
Manchas was afraid of... wolves!
The wolves are the night howlers.
If they took Manchas...

NAME: NICK
...I bet they took Otterton too.

NAME: HOPPS
All we gotta do is find out where
they went.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Wait. Where'd they go?

NAME: NICK
You know, if I wanted to avoid
surveillance because I was doing
something illegal-- which I never
have-- I would use the maintenance
tunnel 6B... which would put them
out...

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
...right there.

NAME: HOPPS
Well, look at you, Junior
Detective. You know, I think you'd
actually make a pretty good cop.

NAME: NICK
How dare you.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Acacia alley... Ficus underpass...
South Canyon...

NAME: HOPPS
They're heading out of town...
Where does that road go?

NAME: WOLF GUARD
Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a
howl.

NAME: GARY THE WOLF GUARD
I didn't start it.
Oooooooo!

NAME: WOLF GUARD
Oooooooooo!

NAME: HOPPS
Come on!

NAME: NICK
You are a clever bunny.

NAME: HOPPS
It looks like this was a hospital.

NAME: NICK
You know, after you, you're the
cop.

NAME: NICK
Okay. All clear.

NAME: HOPPS
All this equipment is brand new...

NAME: HOPPS
Claw marks...

NAME: NICK
Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I
mean, what kind of--

NAME: HOPPS
Mr. Manchas.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
It's him. We found our otter.
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer
Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to
find you. We're gonna get you out
of here now.

NAME: NICK
Or not. Guess he's in no rush to
get home to the Missus.

NAME: HOPPS
...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including
Manchas it's 14...
Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing
Mammal files... They're all here.
All the missing mammals are right
here.

NAME: BADGER DOCTOR
Mayor Lionheart, please, we're
doing everything we can.

NAME: LIONHEART
Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a
half animals here who've gone off
the rails crazy-- and you can't
tell me why. Now, I'd call that
awfully far from doing everything.

NAME: BADGER DOCTOR
Sir, it may be time to consider
their biology.

NAME: LIONHEART
What? What do you mean biology?

NAME: BADGER DOCTOR
The only animals going savage are
predators. We cannot keep it a
secret. We need to come forward.

NAME: LIONHEART
Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public.
And how do you think they're gonna
feel about their mayor, who is a
lion?! I'll be ruined!

NAME: BADGER DOCTOR
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

NAME: LIONHEART
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are
going to keep it that way.

NAME: LIONHEART (CONT'D)
Someone's here!

NAME: BADGER DOCTOR
Sir, you need to go, now!
Security! Sweep the area!

NAME: NICK
Great! We're dead. We're dead.
That's it. I'm dead. You're dead.
Everybody's dead.

NAME: HOPPS
Can you swim?

NAME: NICK
What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim.
Why?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?!

NAME: HOPPS
We gotta tell Bogo!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Chief Bogo!

NAME: BOGO
Not now!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Wait, is that Gazelle?

NAME: BOGO
(struggling to silence his
phone)
No!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
You have the app too?!
Oh, jeeeeez!

NAME: BOGO
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm
working on the missing mammal
cases?!

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Oh, yes of course! About that,
sir... Officer Hopps just called...
She found all of `em.

NAME: HOPPS
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything--

NAME: LIONHEART
You don't understand. I was trying
to protect the city.

NAME: HOPPS
You were just trying to protect
your job.

NAME: LIONHEART
No. Listen, we still don't know why
this is happening. It could destroy
Zootopia.

NAME: HOPPS
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court
of law...

NAME: BOGO
Ladies and Gentlemammals... 14
mammals went missing and all 14
have been found by our newest
recruit, who will speak to you in a
moment. But first, let me remind
you--

NAME: HOPPS
Rrrgh. I am so nervous...

NAME: NICK
Okay, press conference 101: You
wanna look smart?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Answer their question with your own
question and then answer that
question. Like this, "Excuse me.
Officer Hopps, what can you tell us
about the case?"
"Well, was this a tough case? Yes.
Yes it was." You see?

NAME: HOPPS
You should be there with me. We did
this together.

NAME: NICK
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

NAME: HOPPS
Funny you should say that, because
I've been thinking... it would be
nice to have a partner.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Here. In case you need something to
write with.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Officer Hopps, it's time.

NAME: BOGO
So now, I'll turn things over to
the officer who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.

NAME: PRESS
Officer Hopps! / Over here! / Here!

NAME: HOPPS
Yes?

NAME: REPORTER
What can you tell us about the
animals that went savage?

NAME: HOPPS
Well, the animals in question...
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes they are.

NAME: REPORTER 2
Okay, so what is the connection?

NAME: HOPPS
Well, all we know is that they are
all members of the predator family.

NAME: ANOTHER REPORTER
So, predators are the only ones
going savage?

NAME: HOPPS
That is accu-- Yes, that is
accurate. Yes...

NAME: REPORTER 3
Wow. Why is that happening?

NAME: HOPPS
We still don't know--

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Ah, it may have something to do
with biology.

NAME: HOPPS
A biological component. You know,
something in their DNA...

NAME: REPORTER 4
In their DNA? Can you elaborate on
that, please?

NAME: HOPPS
Yes. What I mean is, thousands of
years ago... um... predators
survived through their aggressive
hunting instincts. For whatever
reason, they seem to be reverting
back to their primitive, savage
ways.

NAME: HOPPS
It is possible. So we must be
vigilant. And we at the ZPD are
prepared and are here to protect
you...

NAME: PRESS
Will more mammals go savage? / What
is being done to protect us? / Have
you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

NAME: BELLWETHER
Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh,
that's all the time that we have.
No more questions...

NAME: HOPPS
Was I okay?

NAME: BELLWETHER
Oh, you did fine.

NAME: HOPPS
That went so fast! I didn't get a
chance to mention you or say
anything about how we--

NAME: NICK
Oh, I think you said plenty.

NAME: HOPPS
What do you mean?

NAME: NICK
Clearly, there's a biological
component? These predators may be
reverting back to their primitive,
savage ways. Are you serious?

NAME: HOPPS
I just stated the facts of the
case. I mean, it's not like a bunny
could go savage...

NAME: NICK
Right. But a fox could? Huh?

NAME: HOPPS
Nick, stop it. You're not like
them.

NAME: NICK
Oh, there's a them now?

NAME: HOPPS
You know what I mean. You're not
that kind of predator.

NAME: NICK
The kind that needs to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think you
need to carry around Fox Repellent?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we
met.
So let me ask you a question. Are
you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts? Do
you think I might go savage? Do you
think I might try to... EAT YOU?!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
...I knew it. Just when I thought
somebody actually believed in me...

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Probably best if you don't have a
predator as a partner.

NAME: HOPPS
No. Nick. Nick!

NAME: REPORTER 5
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

NAME: HOPPS
No. He's my friend.

NAME: REPORTER 6
We can't even trust our own
friends?

NAME: HOPPS
That is not what I said! Please!

NAME: REPORTERS
Are we safe? / Have any other foxes
gone savage?

NAME: FEMALE BOBCAT NEWS ANCHOR
More bad news in this city gripped
by fear.

NAME: FEMALE BOBCAT NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D)
A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling by a savage
polar bear. This-- the 27th such
attack-- comes just one week after
ZPD Officer Judy Hopps connected
the violence to traditionally
predatory animals.

NAME: MALE MOOSE NEWS ANCHOR
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized
by pop star, Gazelle, was marred by
protest.

NAME: PIG
Go back to the forest, predator!

NAME: LEOPARD
I'm from the savannah!

NAME: GAZELLE
Zootopia is a unique place. It's a
crazy, beautiful, diverse city
where we celebrate our differences.
(gestures to PROTESTERS in
background)
This is not the Zootopia I know.

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
That's not my Emmitt.

NAME: GAZELLE
We cannot let fear divide us.
Please-- give me back the Zootopia
I love...

NAME: BOGO
Come on Hopps. The new Mayor wants
to see us.

NAME: HOPPS
The Mayor? Why?

NAME: BOGO
It would seem you've arrived.

NAME: HOPPS
Clawhauser? What're you doing?

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
Um, they thought it would be better
if a predator such as myself wasn't
the first face you that you see
when you walk into the ZPD.

NAME: HOPPS
What?

NAME: CLAWHAUSER
They're gonna move me to Records.
It's downstairs. By the boiler.

NAME: BOGO
Hopps!

NAME: HOPPS
Um... I don't understand.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And
right now they're just really
scared. You're a hero to them. They
trust you. And so that's why Chief
Bogo and I want you to be the
public face of the ZPD.

NAME: HOPPS
I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came
here to make the world a better
place, but I think I broke it.

NAME: BOGO
Don't give yourself so much credit,
Hopps. The world has always been
broken. That's why we need good
cops-- like you.

NAME: HOPPS
With all due respect, sir, a good
cop is supposed to serve and
protect-- help the city. Not tear
it apart.
I don't deserve this badge.

NAME: BOGO
Hopps.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Judy, you've worked so hard to get
here. It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid. You can't quit...

NAME: HOPPS
Thank you for the opportunity.

NAME: HOPPS
A dozen carrots.

NAME: RABBIT MOM
Thanks!

NAME: HOPPS
Have a nice day.

NAME: RABBIT MOM
Come on.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude,
remember that one? How we doin?

NAME: HOPPS.
I'm fine.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
You are not fine. Your ears are
droopy.

NAME: HOPPS
Why did I think I could make a
difference?

NAME: STU HOPPS
Because you're a trier, that's why.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
You've always been a trier.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, I tried. And it made life so
much worse for so many innocent
predators.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Oh, not all of them, though. Speak
of the devil. Right on time.

NAME: HOPPS
Is that... Gideon Grey?

NAME: STU HOPPS
Yep. It sure is. We work with him
now.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it had you
not opened our minds.

NAME: STU HOPPS
That's right. I mean, Gid's turned
into one of the top pastry chefs in
the tri-burrows.

NAME: HOPPS
That's really cool, you guys.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

NAME: ADULT GIDEON GREY
Hey Judy-- I'd like to say I'm
sorry for the way I behaved in my
youth. I had a lotta self-doubt
that manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression. I
was a major jerk.

NAME: HOPPS
Well, I know a thing or two about
being a jerk...

NAME: ADULT GIDEON GREY
Anyhow-- I brought you all these
pies.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Hey kids! Don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias!

NAME: RABBIT KID
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

NAME: ADULT GIDEON GREY
Now there's a 4-dollar word, Mr. H.
My family always just called them
night howlers.

NAME: HOPPS
I'm sorry, what did you say?

NAME: STU HOPPS
Oh, Gid's talking about those
flowers, Judy. I use `em to keep
bugs off the produce. But I don't
like the little ones going near `em
on account of what happened to your
Uncle Terry.

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we
were kids and went completely nuts.

NAME: STU HOPPS
He bit the dickens out of your
mother.

NAME: HOPPS
A bunny can go savage...

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

NAME: STU HOPPS
Well sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that
savage.

NAME: HOPPS
Night howlers aren't wolves.
They're flowers. The flowers are
making the predators go savage.
That's it! That's what I've been
missing!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry!
Come on! Thank you, I love you bye!

NAME: STU HOPPS
You catch any of that, Bon?

NAME: BONNIE HOPPS
Not one bit.

NAME: GIDEON GREY
Well, that makes me feel a little
better. I thought she was talking
in tongues or something.

NAME: FINNICK
Who is it?

NAME: HOPPS
I need to find Nick. Please.

NAME: HOPPS
Nick? Nick!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Oh, Nick! Night howlers aren't
wolves. They're toxic flowers. I
think someone is targeting
predators on purpose and making
them go savage.

NAME: NICK
Wow. Isn't that interesting.

NAME: HOPPS
Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll
never forgive me. And I don't blame
you. I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant and irresponsible
and small-minded... But predators
shouldn't suffer because of my
mistakes. I have to fix this, but I
can't do it without you.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
And after we're done, you can hate
me, and that'll be fine, because I
was a horrible friend and I hurt
you... and you can walk away
knowing you were right all along, I
really am just a dumb bunny.

NAME: HOPPS (ON RECORDER) (CONT'D)
I really am just a dumb bunny. I
really am just a dumb bunny.

NAME: NICK
Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you
erase it... in 48 hours.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Alright, get in here.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so
emotional. There we go. Deep
breath.
Are you just trying to steal the
pen. Is that what this is?
You are standing on my tail,
though. Off, off, off.

NAME: HOPPS
I'm sorry.

NAME: NICK
I thought you guys only grew
carrots.
What's the plan?

NAME: HOPPS
We are gonna follow the night
howlers.

NAME: NICK
Okay. How?

NAME: HOPPS
Know this guy?

NAME: NICK
Uh-huh. I told you, I know
everybody.

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
Well, hello, step right up!
Anything you need... I got it. All
your favorite movies! I got movies
that haven't even been released
yet!

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON (CONT'D)
Hey, 15% off! 20! Make me an offer!
Come on!

NAME: NICK
Well, well, look who it is. The
duke of bootleg.

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't
you be melting down a popsicle or
something?
Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.

NAME: HOPPS
We both know those weren't moldy
onions I caught you stealing. What
were you gonna do with those night
howlers, Wessleton?

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And
I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't
nothing you can do to make me.

NAME: MR. BIG
Ice `em.

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
Aaagh! Agh!
Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?!
She's a cop!

NAME: MR. BIG
And the godmother to my future
granddaughter.

NAME: FRU FRU SHREW
I'm gonna name her Judy.

NAME: HOPPS
Aw.

NAME: MR. BIG
Ice this weasel.

NAME: DUKE WEASELTON
All right, all right, please! I'll
talk! I'll talk. I stole them night
howlers so I could sell `em. They
offered me what I couldn't
refuse... Money.

NAME: HOPPS
And to whom did you sell them?

NAME: HOPPS
Come on!

NAME: HOPPS
The weasel wasn't lying.

NAME: NICK
Yeah, looks like old Doug's
cornered the market on night
howlers...

NAME: DOUG
You got Doug here. What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

NAME: DOUG (CONT'D)
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.
I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny
little otter through the open
window of a moving car.

NAME: DOUG (CONT'D)
Yeah I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news. Ya
know, whichever comes first.

NAME: DOUG
Alright, Woolter and Jesse are
back, so I'm leaving now.
Out.

NAME: NICK
Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get
back here! What are you doing?!
He's gonna see you! What are you
looking at? Hey! Whatever you're
thinking, stop thinking it.
Carrots! Carrots!

NAME: DOUG
It better have the extra foam this
time--

NAME: NICK
What are you doing?! You just
trapped us in here!

NAME: HOPPS
We need to get this evidence to the

NAME: NICK
Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.

NAME: HOPPS
No. All of it!

NAME: NICK
Wait, what?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Great, you're a conductor now? Hey,
listen-- It would take a miracle to
get this rust-bucket going.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Well... Hallelujah!

NAME: DOUG
We kinda got a situation at the
lab...
Oh! It just got worse!

NAME: NICK
Mission accomplished. Would it be
premature for me to do a little
victory toot-toot?

NAME: HOPPS
All right. One toot-toot.

NAME: NICK
Well, I can cross that off the
bucket list.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Maybe that's just hail?

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Back off!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Incoming!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Carrots?!

NAME: HOPPS
Don't stop! Keep going!

NAME: JESSE
No! No! Please stop!

NAME: HOPPS
Do not stop this car!

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

NAME: NICK
There's another train coming!

NAME: HOPPS
Trust me! SPEED! UP!

NAME: WOOLTER
Stop the train! Hey!

NAME: HOPPS
Hey. Need some help?

NAME: NICK
Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast!
Hold on!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
I think this is our stop!

NAME: HOPPS
Okay... Maybe some of the evidence
survived.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Everything is gone. We've lost it
all.

NAME: NICK
Yeah. Oh, except for this.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, Nick! Yes!

NAME: NICK
Ow.

NAME: HOPPS
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through the Natural History
Museum!

NAME: HOPPS
Oh! There it is!

NAME: HOPPS
Mayor Bellwether!
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a
serum-- that's what's making them
go savage.

NAME: BELLWETHER
I am so proud of you, Judy. You did
just a super job.

NAME: HOPPS
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know where to find us?

NAME: BELLWETHER
I'll go ahead and I'll take that
case now.

NAME: HOPPS
You know what... I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD...

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)                          NICK
Run!                            Run!

NAME: BELLWETHER
Get them!

NAME: HOPPS
Ach!

NAME: NICK
Ah Carrots!

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
I got ya, come here, come here.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Okay, now just relax.

NAME: NICK (CONT'D)
Whoops... Blueberry?

NAME: HOPPS
Pass.

NAME: HOPPS
Take the case. Get it to Bogo.

NAME: NICK
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

NAME: HOPPS
I can't walk.

NAME: NICK
Just, we'll think of something.

NAME: BELLWETHER
We're on the same team, Judy!

NAME: BELLWETHER
Underestimated. Under-appreciated.
Aren't you sick of it? Predators.
They may be strong and loud, but
prey out-number predators 10 to
one.

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Think of it-- 90 percent of the
population, united against a common
enemy. We'll be unstoppable.

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Over there!

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Well, you should have stayed on the
carrot farm, huh? It really is too
bad; I really did like you.

NAME: HOPPS
What are you going to do? Kill me?

NAME: BELLWETHER
No! Of course not... he is.

NAME: HOPPS
No! Nick?!

NAME: BELLWETHER
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the natural history museum.
Officer Hopps is down! Please
hurry!

NAME: HOPPS
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

NAME: BELLWETHER (CONT'D)
Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero
Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."

NAME: HOPPS
So that's it, prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

NAME: BELLWETHER
Yeah, pretty much.

NAME: HOPPS
It won't work.

NAME: BELLWETHER
Fear always works. And I'll dart
every predator in Zootopia to keep
it that way.

NAME: HOPPS
Oh, Nick! No!

NAME: BELLWETHER
Bye-Bye, Bunny.

NAME: HOPPS
Blood, blood, blood! And death.

NAME: NICK
All right, you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it, I think
we got it. We got it up there,
thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it
all out beautifully.

NAME: BELLWETHER
What?

NAME: NICK
Yea, oh, are you looking for the
serum?
Well, it's right here.

NAME: HOPPS
What you've got in the weapon there-
- those are blueberries. From my
family's farm.

NAME: NICK
They are delicious.
You should try some.

NAME: BELLWETHER
I framed Lionheart, I can frame you
too! It's my word against yours!

NAME: HOPPS
Oooo, actually--

NAME: HOPPS
--It's your word against yours.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
Boom.

NAME: PREY ANCHOR
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,
claiming he was just trying to
protect the city.

NAME: LIONHEART
Did I falsely imprison those
animals? Well, yes. Yes I did. It
was a classic "doing the wrong
thing for the right reason" kind of
a deal.

NAME: PRED ANCHOR
In related news, doctors say the
night howler antidote is proving
effective in rehabilitating the
afflicted predators...

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON
Emmitt? Oh... Emmitt...

NAME: MRS. OTTERTON (CONT'D)
Thank you.

NAME: HOPPS
So, no matter what type of animal
you are, from the biggest elephant
to our first fox...

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
I implore you... try. Try to make
the world a better place.

NAME: HOPPS (CONT'D)
Look inside yourself, and recognize
that change starts with you. It
starts with me. It starts with all
of us.

NAME: BOGO
...Enough! Shut it! We have some
new recruits with us this morning,
including our first fox. Who cares.

NAME: NICK
Ha! You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards,
sir.

Shut your mouth, Wilde.

Just kidding! We have reports of a

So are all rabbits bad drivers or
is it just you?

NAME: HOPPS
Oops. Sorry.

NAME: NICK
Sly bunny.

NAME: HOPPS
Dumb fox.

NAME: NICK
You know you love me.

NAME: HOPPS
Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do.

Sir, you were going 115 miles per
hour. I hope you have a good
explanation.

Flash? Flash? Hundred yard dash?!

NAME: ROOKIE COP
Cooool.

NAME: ARTHUR
Evening, Constable!

NAME: OLDER COP 1
Hi, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
Are you familiar with the
expression `I can explain
everything'?

NAME: OLDER COP 1
Out of the car, please.

NAME: ARTHUR
Terribly sorry, but in the film
they used a different model to show
the old Batchap getting in and out.
This one has no doors, so I'd have
to squeeze out the back arsehole
first. Which nobody wants...
Apart from you, cheeky monkey!
It's a joke! Okay, okay.

NAME: OLDER COP 1
Okay, explain everything.

NAME: ARTHUR
Well. What with having spunked 1.6
million fat Alberts on this little
runaround, I thought why not take
it a step further and try to
actually collar a few ne-er do
wells? It worked for the
billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
Templemead? Will I have to do
traffic school?

NAME: OLDER COP 2
How much have you drunk, Arthur?

NAME: ARTHUR
To use the technical medical term -
megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
have a designated driver.

NAME: HOMELESS ROBIN
Where's my five thousand dollars?

NAME: ARTHUR
The Boy Homeless here neglected to
say he'd never driven.

Or that the only reason he's sober
is to be ready for the conspiracy
of leopards about to seize
Manhattan.

NAME: HOMELESS ROBIN
It's LIZARDS! English prick!

NAME: ARTHUR
I trust this will cover all repairs
to New York and any inconvenience
to your good selves?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
other chap.

NAME: JAY
Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!

NAME: ARTHUR
Goodness. Why?

NAME: JAY
Said I cut the bombita with pig
killer!

NAME: ARTHUR
Rude man. And who threw hot
Americano in whose face again?

NAME: JAY
I did in his. No half and half
neither. That shit burnt!

NAME: GARY
I burnt my sister's hair.

NAME: JAY
Cool...

I don't fit her definition of

of becoming a crack whore?

NAME: PROSTITUTE
Mother died when I was six.

Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.

My father raped me when I was
twelve.

NAME: ARTHUR
Sounds like you had six relatively
good years.

NAME: JAY
What do you do?

NAME: ARTHUR
I model riding boots, I spend
money, I sleep with women. But I
have weekends off and I am my own
boss.

Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G-

NAME: DEVERE
I don't think your mother will be
pleased, Arthur.

Really, Elverton - if a chap can't
help out a few chums, whatever
their station in life.

Each has given his or her word to
put the criminal life behind them.

I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep
easy tonight.

Don't point that shit at me, bitch!
I will FUCK YOU UP!

NAME: HOMELESS ROBIN
Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!

NAME: PRESS
Arthur! What will your mother say?
Didn't she send you here to get you
out of the British papers? Arthur!

NAME: ARTHUR
Anyone need a job? My last driver
resigned after I filled his limo
with squirrels. Preferably sober,
clean driving licence?

NAME: ARTHUR
Stand back!

NAME: ARTHUR
The what?

NAME: ARTHUR
Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix
this thing right now.
How much, sir?

NAME: FIRST MAN
Um. $800 please.

NAME: ARTHUR
Coming right up.
Fries with that?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Congratulations everyone! THE

you squeeze me in for a little
snack? Yeah, just me and a couple
of mates.

NAME: ARTHUR
Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie
gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a
motherlode of chips and your entire
wine cellar please.

NAME: ERICA
Arthur?

NAME: ERICA
Who are the women with you, Arthur?

NAME: ARTHUR
Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe
she works for Avis. Checks the cars
for dings, dead people in the
trunk, that sort of thing. And
this is Carmella. Anyway...

NAME: ERICA'S FATHER
What do you do, Carmella?

NAME: CARMELLA
Whatever you want. But no
penetration without a rubber.

NAME: ARTHUR
Carmella's joking. She's actually
a...queen. Of a very small country.

NAME: ERICA'S FATHER
Is she now?

NAME: ARTHUR
It's terribly small.

NAME: ERICA'S FATHER
I see.

NAME: ARTHUR
Rhode Island could beat the crap
out of it in a war.

NAME: ERICA'S FATHER
Yes, it's a small place.

NAME: ARTHUR
85 cents in a cab from one end of
the country to the other. I'm
talking small.

NAME: ERICA'S FATHER
I think I understand how small it
is.

NAME: ARTHUR
Just had the entire country
carpeted, this is not a big place.

NAME: ERICA'S FATHER
You need to grow up, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
That's easy for you to say, you
haven't got 50 pairs of short
trousers hanging in your closet.
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

NAME: ERICA
Maybe you should.

NAME: ARTHUR
Could I have all those lobsters to
go, please?

Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot

Morning, Hobson!

NAME: HOBSON
Morning, Arthur.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus
package failed to reignite the
economy.
De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?

NAME: ARTHUR
Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.

NAME: HOBSON
The African heritage festival
celebrated five months from now?

NAME: ARTHUR
(noticing Sofia's stopped
having sex with him)
Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry.
How impolite of me. Sofia, this is
Hobson, my nanny.

NAME: SOFIA
Nanny?

NAME: HOBSON
He's merely shaped like an adult.

NAME: SOFIA
Is she going to stay here?

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson, could you come back in a
minute and a half please?

NAME: HOBSON
Negative. You're seeing your mother
this morning.

NAME: ARTHUR
Nobody told me.

NAME: HOBSON
Actually I did, on the other side
of the vast moat of champagne known
as `last night'.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
I wouldn't recommend letting him
get used to your breasts, dear.
Addictive personality. He was at
mine until he was six.

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson! Really...

NAME: HOBSON
I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the
nipples to see him off...

NAME: SOFIA
I can't do this.

NAME: HOBSON
I support your decision 100%. Will
you be requiring a taxi, or just be
getting in a random passing car?

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
Say goodbye to your new friends,
Arthur. They have to go back to the
recession now.

NAME: ARTHUR
Cancel my mother please, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Not the death metal, please!

NAME: HOBSON
Aren't you a fan of Carcass?

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
`Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a
classic of its genre.

NAME: HOBSON
Good boy.

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm going for a shower.

NAME: HOBSON
I'll alert the media.

NAME: HOBSON
They brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her
name...Hobson!

NAME: ARTHUR
Female Tom Hanks!

NAME: HOBSON
She's early today...

NAME: ARTHUR
Can we invite her up and dress her
as Forrest Gump?

NAME: HOBSON
No.

NAME: ARTHUR
Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.

NAME: HOBSON
Do your armpits.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
Mr. Miller? My employer
inexplicably agreed to purchase
your...
`Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care

costs? Sorry, but that transaction
will take place over my dead body,
and I'm feeling rather well today.

Father Wolverine...

Wank Williams...That man has the
constitution of an ox.

NAME: HOBSON
That reminds me, clean your
genitals. Heaven knows what
wildlife that girl was harbouring
between her thighs.

NAME: ARTHUR
I give you `Sideways farting
spider'.

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur, you have to stop giving
money away!

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm a philanthropist.

NAME: HOBSON
With the emphasis on the `pissed'.
Really, what is it about unearned
wealth that brings out such idiocy
in those who have it and those who
want it? The way you're going,
you'll have spent your inheritance
before you've inherited it.

NAME: ARTHUR
`Eagle pointing at lesbian.'

NAME: HOBSON
Why did you fire Jessica?

NAME: ARTHUR
What kind of yoga teacher won't let
a pupil invent positions? She was
a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D.
`Upwards Pooping Astronaut'.

NAME: HOBSON
Interesting. It looks more like
`Rich twit hiding from mother.' May
I remind you, she finances your
preposterous existence...

NAME: ARTHUR
I know, I know. Never bite the hand
that fists me.

NAME: MARTY
Sorry, fellas.

NAME: ARTHUR
Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He
got laid off in Chicago...

NAME: HOBSON
But he doesn't know his way around
New York!

NAME: ARTHUR
So? I want interesting, fun people
around me, not drones who just get
the job done...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Marty! Stop the car!

NAME: NAOMI
...and inspired by the machine age
of the 1920s, this magnificent
structure was the world's tallest
building for 11 months before the
Empire State stole its thunder.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
The Chrysler got its name when the
builder went bust in the 1928
Cement Famine and had to melt down
his Chrysler to make the pointy bit
at the top. If you peer closely you
can still make out remnants of a
hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk
twice if you voted Hoover.'

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
That was a joke, folks. It was
built for the Chrysler corporation.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
The spire is a beauty, especially
on a winter's morning when the sun
hits it and it just seems to...

NAME: NAOMI
1047 feet madam, not allowing for
pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.

NAME: ARTHUR
Can I join your tour please?

NAME: NAOMI
Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the
free authentic street pretzel.
Sorry, my bosses make the prices.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Sorry. I can't take cards.
Ah, owe me it. I start on that
corner every day on the hour...

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't
your braille windshield work?

NAME: ARTHUR
Wow. What did you say?

NAME: NAOMI
Just generalised criticism of his
parents and genitals.
Everyone make it over alive?
Excellent. Next we enter Times
Square, world famous for New Year's
Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball
descends at eye-poppingly slow
speed for the inexplicable
entertainment of a million drunk
fools. Many people think the square
is actually a square, despite
blatant evidence otherwise.
Sir? What shape is Times Square?

NAME: ARTHUR
A circle?

NAME: GRUMPY MALE TOURIST
When do we get the pretzel?

NAME: NAOMI
Soon, sir. Soon.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Okay, next the very Laundromat once
used by George Gershwin, Donald
Trump...

NAME: NAOMI
...Mr Big from Sex and the City and
three of the 9-11 terrorists.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Oh, dad.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank
himself to death at the Chelsea
Hotel half an hour after losing a
sock in this very dryer.

NAME: NAOMI
Are you abusing the tour to stalk
me?

NAME: ARTHUR
Absolutely.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
These things are amazing. Have you
ever put all your father's clothes
on and just got inside one?

NAME: HOBSON
Where the blazes is that boy?
Arthur!

NAME: NAOMI
Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's
crown, the Empire State Building.
This iconic symbol of American
corporate might was adapted during
World War 2 in case of attack from
enemy forces. At three minutes'
notice the entire structure can
retract into the ground like a
tortoise's head.

NAME: TOURIST
That's not possible. I should know,
I'm a civil engineer.

NAME: NAOMI
You're not being very civil to me.

NAME: ARTHUR
The building doesn't retract; the
ground rises up.

NAME: NAOMI
Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank
you, sir.

NAME: ARTHUR
They were going to install giant
legs so if a plane was flying at
the tower it could run away. But
where's it going to run?

NAME: NAOMI
Manhattan's in the way.

NAME: ARTHUR
It'd have to jump in the Hudson.

NAME: NAOMI
Victory to the Nazis. Is that what
you want?

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Do I know you from somewhere?

NAME: ARTHUR
If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.

NAME: NAOMI
What are they?

NAME: ARTHUR
The gossip websites.

NAME: NAOMI
That the internet? Ah, my
computer's too old for all that.

NAME: ARTHUR
For the internet? Seriously?

NAME: NAOMI
Life's too short for all this
obsessive upgrading.

NAME: ARTHUR
You consider the internet an
upgrade? Wow.

NAME: NAOMI
So why do people gossip about you?

NAME: ARTHUR
Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.

NAME: HOBSON
You're late for your mother!

NAME: HOBSON)
The soup kitchen's just up and to
the left, honey.

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson, this is...
Naomi.

NAME: NAOMI
She's with you?

NAME: HOBSON
Delighted to meet you, Naomi.
Normally one has to go to a bowling
alley to meet a woman of your
stature.

NAME: NAOMI
Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.

NAME: HOBSON
You aren't the first woman who
walks the streets this young man
has asked.

NAME: NAOMI
Who's this? Joan Rivers' older
bitterer sister?

NAME: ARTHUR
My nanny.

NAME: NAOMI
Obviously. Seriously, who is she?

NAME: ARTHUR
My nanny. Well, she started as
that, but these days she's more of
an all-round enforcer and
bodyguard.

NAME: NAOMI
Sorry, I have to get out the cattle
prod and haul ass. Got another tour
starting in eight minutes.

NAME: ARTHUR
Can I call you?

NAME: NAOMI
I don't give my number to grown men
with nannies. But as you may not be
a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.

NAME: ARTHUR
But what if this is the one?

NAME: HOBSON
This is just like the Komodo
dragon. Everyone else is happy to
see one in the zoo and leave it
there. You had to own one. Thank
goodness that handbag manufacturer
was prepared to take the poor
lizard away.

NAME: HOBSON
He is, Arthur. Are you the only one
allowed to joke now?

NAME: ARTHUR
I don't like it here.

NAME: HOBSON
Of course you don't. People work
here.

NAME: ARTHUR
Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your
parents are you most like?
Abercrombie or Fitch?

NAME: GRANT
I have no connection with that
store. My family name is Von
Krausehoff. Take a seat please.

NAME: GRANT (CONT'D)
Vivienne?
White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.

NAME: HOBSON
Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take
long. Then we'll have ice cream.

NAME: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
Vivienne.

NAME: VIVIENNE
You know I prefer `mother'.

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm sorry. You look more like a
Vivienne.

NAME: VIVIENNE
So. How are you, Arthur?

NAME: ARTHUR
Quite busy. I have a riding boot
shoot for Petrie Dressage...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
What else...I'm meeting Ivanka
Trump for brunch to discuss the
environment. She's sending her
helicopter to avoid the traffic...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Crashed my Batmobile into the
bronze bull on Wall Street...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
...which caused a hole to swallow
up the New York Stock Exchange...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
..the world economy to collapse and
the planet to descend into looting
and cannibalism.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
What else? Um...tripped over in the
shower this morning. Head split
open, found a family of meerkats
hiding in there! Hated the thought
of the little lads being homeless
so I bricked up the remaining half
of my brain, popped them back in
and Hobson glued my skull back
together.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I'm thinking of buying a giant. I
think the market's right for it.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You really are a shoddy mother.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Did I hear you say you were meeting
Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's
nice. Right. Today we're going to
have a friendly chat. Then a
serious talk. And lastly make a
timetable. How does all that sound?

NAME: ARTHUR
Amazing. Do you have any vodka?

NAME: VIVIENNE
What happened, Arthur? You were
such a sweet baby.

NAME: ARTHUR
I still wake up in my own poo
occasionally.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Right, that's it for the chat. Time
to transition to our talk.

NAME: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
This insanity has to end, Arthur.
As the delightful coffee-coloured
gentleman who runs this country
said, `The time has come to set
aside childish things.'

NAME: ARTHUR
Can't Hobson set them aside for me?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet
are on the ground, she's of fine
stock...

NAME: VIVIENNE
And? You think I spent my marriage
to your father skipping through
meadows?

NAME: ARTHUR
Not after you ran him over in the
Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's
not funny.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Ditto your father. The aristocracy
doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur.
It's about stability. Continuity...

NAME: ARTHUR
...and sinking your fangs into
Susan's father's bank account.

NAME: VIVIENNE
The Johnson family's considerable
equity in a stormy financial period
is merely a side issue. Burt is a
pillar of the community.

NAME: ARTHUR
His baby formula was taken off the
market in six African countries!

NAME: VIVIENNE
A completely innocent error in
places where there's precious
little for children to live for
anyway. The families all got gift
baskets as compensation. That
little bump in the road aside, Burt
is a devout Christian.

NAME: ARTHUR
Yes, because they're never insane.
And where did he get Jesus?

NAME: ARTHUR
He strangled a fireman! Who
strangles a fireman?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur...

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met
someone else very lovely who, as
far as I know, isn't related to
anyone who would kill an unsung
hero in cold blood.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end
of our line. We need an heir.

NAME: ARTHUR
I nearly gave you an heir!

NAME: VIVIENNE
Oh, give me strength! A Bach-
Templemead having a child by a lap
dancer called `Mystery'?

NAME: ARTHUR
That was just her stage name! To
give her more mystery when
she...waved her fanny around. Her
real name was...what was it again?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Susan is 33 this year. Her egg
inventory has dropped by 23% since
you met her. You risk having no
sons, or worse, some pea-brained
hunchback who hugs everyone!

NAME: ARTHUR
Great! I like hugs! And some of
them are really good at math.
You know the `Frog and Toad' books?

NAME: VIVIENNE
No.

NAME: ARTHUR
Of course you don't. Hobson read
them to me while you were off
riding horses over stripey poles.
They're about fun and friendship,
not how many unspasticated tadpoles
I can squirt up a rich girl.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Your father would turn in his grave
to hear this nonsense...

NAME: ARTHUR
That I won't follow in his
footsteps and marry a woman I hate?
I think he might climb out of the
grave and dance on it.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Suit yourself.

NAME: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
My will, which I have updated to
designate Grant in reception as the
sole beneficiary.

NAME: ARTHUR
You wouldn't! You're my...

NAME: VIVIENNE
...Vivienne? Try me.

NAME: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
Shall we segue to the timetable
part of our meeting?

NAME: HOBSON
Ah. The ring your father gave your
mother, I recall.

NAME: ARTHUR
Did he knock her out with it, then
drive her to the church in the
trunk of his Bentley?

NAME: HOBSON
No. Your father was a gentleman.

NAME: ARTHUR
What's gentlemanly about dying
before I knew him? That's just
rude. Did he ever love my mother?

NAME: HOBSON
They had their days.

NAME: ARTHUR
Ah well. At least he doesn't have
to wake up every day to a woman
with a face like saran wrap
stretched over a gargoyle.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
What about Naomi?

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur. I say this with love:

NAME: ARTHUR
Uh-oh...

NAME: HOBSON
Even by modern male standards
you're a breathtakingly immature
little shit. Coupled with the kind
of money you have access to, that's
deadly. Susan may not have a four
hour stand up routine about the
Flatiron Building, but she's a
solid girl who will look after you.

NAME: ARTHUR
I have you for that.

NAME: HOBSON
Not forever.

NAME: ARTHUR
Yes forever. You're Hobson.

NAME: NAOMI
Hello?
Hello?

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm sorry, I've never really
understood that question. Are you
free tomorrow night?

NAME: NAOMI
Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht.

NAME: ARTHUR
Is that a euphemism for something
naughty?

NAME: NAOMI
No, it's a lie. I have a creative
writing class. Tonight?

NAME: ARTHUR
I have a contractual commitment.
Friday?

NAME: NAOMI
You got it.

NAME: ARTHUR
Paper.

NAME: NAOMI
Sorry?

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, I was talking to something
else. So. What do you want to do?

NAME: NAOMI
A movie?

NAME: ARTHUR
Movie? Come on, you've got to try
harder than that.

NAME: NAOMI
Pizza.

NAME: ARTHUR
What have you always wanted to do?

NAME: NAOMI
It's a first date, Arthur. Not our
honeymoon.

NAME: ARTHUR
Every date will be our honeymoon.

NAME: ARTHUR
What sort of food do you like?

NAME: NAOMI
Anything but guts and mushrooms.
Okay, enough questions.

NAME: ARTHUR
Oh come on. This all helps build up
a profile of you before I trick you
into my basement. I'd hate to not
have your favourite snacks ready.

NAME: NAOMI
Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done?
Just that I....

NAME: HOBSON
Time to get engaged, Arthur. The
Komodo dragon can wait.

NAME: ARTHUR
Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?

NAME: BUTLER
No, sir. It's 8.34.

NAME: ARTHUR
FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can
be a real cunt sometimes, don't you
think? I'll be right back. See you
in an hour and a half ago...

NAME: BUTLER
Would you care for anything while
you wait?

NAME: ARTHUR
A trampoline and a selection of
woodland creatures if that's not
too much trouble.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Ah!
Shhhhh...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Bollocks.
Sorry. Actually, you couldn't,
um....you know...
...turn this into a nice 1990
Romanee Conti, could you?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Cheers ears.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
`Genuine Sword of the First
Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Jesus Fucking Christ!
Sorry. It's not like you shouted
`Arthur Fucking Bach' when they
pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Feel the force, Luke.

NAME: BURT
Arthur!

NAME: ARTHUR
I, er, had a bit of food stuck in
my teeth and couldn't find a
toothpick.

NAME: BURT
Heck, this sword went through three
crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems.
Nothing you can do to harm it.

NAME: ARTHUR
You don't, um, have anything
stronger, do you?

NAME: BURT
Sparkling.

NAME: BURT (CONT'D)
`The drunkard and the glutton shalt
come to poverty: and drowsiness
shalt clothe a man with rags.'

NAME: ARTHUR
Surely a glass of sherry at
Christmas?

NAME: BURT
Peace be with you.

NAME: ARTHUR
And also with me.

NAME: BURT
Arthur. Can I be honest with you?

NAME: ARTHUR
You're the real Slim Shady? I knew
it!

NAME: BURT
My faith teaches me to hate the
sin, not the sinner. But with you,
I struggle with that belief.

NAME: ARTHUR
You could switch to Judaism.
Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I
put the fan on?

NAME: BURT
Anyway, Arthur. However I feel
about you, my daughter loves you.

NAME: ARTHUR
Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Let's knock our heads together and
find a way to stop her loving
me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on
the sex offenders register....No, I
am and she knows.
Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay!
I did once dabble actually, so I
can tell a plausible story.

NAME: BURT
You made love to a guy?

NAME: ARTHUR
One Moslem doesn't make a mosque,
Burt.

NAME: BURT
You made love to a Moslem?

NAME: ARTHUR
No, sir, it was Prince Alois of
Lichtenstein and he made love to
me. The fact that it took three
bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
full of Krug to loosen me up
confirmed my heterosexuality.

NAME: BURT
`If there is a man who lies with a
male, they shall surely be put to
death.'

NAME: ARTHUR
Crikey. Couldn't there just be some
kind of on-the-spot fine?

NAME: BURT
You will stop this talk and marry -
my - fucking...

NAME: ARTHUR
Oh bollocks.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
It's a miracle! He is risen!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hi Susan. Erica.

NAME: SUSAN
Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I
was talking to your mother. I hear
you have something to ask me!

NAME: ARTHUR
Shall we go?

NAME: ARTHUR
Do you have something with less
words please? The chef doesn't have
to re-cook it, just scrape off the
nouns and trim out all that
gibberish in the middle.

NAME: SUSAN
He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do
the skate in wood ear mushroom.

NAME: WAITER
Excellent decision. Sir?

NAME: ARTHUR
A bowl of champagne and a spoon.

NAME: SUSAN
Arthur, did you really have to be
so icky to Dominic?

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm sorry. I just can't handle the
whole specials act. It's not a
Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some
heated up dead things that aren't
on the main menu.

NAME: SUSAN
You know, I was grumbling to your
mother about how things are with us
sometimes. How I'm sure you're
trying to drive me away...

NAME: ARTHUR
Um hm.

NAME: SUSAN
But she was explaining that
relationships are like property
purchases; invest only in high-end
stock, avoid anyone 'up-and-
coming', then hold onto the
property through thick and thin to
deliver maximum return! Isn't that
darling?

NAME: ARTHUR
Is it possible to buy the house but
then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm
not suggesting pimping you.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Look. You after our first child is
born.

NAME: SUSAN
Arthur. Why can't you learn to
laugh at genuinely amusing things?

NAME: ARTHUR
Such as?

NAME: SUSAN
YouTube clips of babies giggling.
Dane Cook.

NAME: ARTHUR
Susan. Why are we together?

NAME: SUSAN
I love you, Arthur. And you love
me, whatever you think.

NAME: ARTHUR
We don't have the same sense of
humour. We don't like the same
films, food, music. You like
horses, I think they're arrogant
idiots...

NAME: SUSAN
Don't they say opposites attract?

NAME: ARTHUR
That depends on the opposites.
Racists and the Nation of Islam
don't secretly want to 69 each
other. Susan, you're beautiful.
You're bright. You're fucking
loaded. Is there really no one else
who could make you happy?

NAME: SUSAN
No.

NAME: ARTHUR
Never?

NAME: SUSAN
Well, I had a thing at college.
That was serious for a while. But
daddy...

NAME: ARTHUR
Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it
not to work out, then shot the
bloke behind a meat truck? Because
Jesus would consider that cheating.

NAME: SUSAN
Ask me, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
Susan. You're the only woman...at
this table.

NAME: SUSAN
You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody
who drinks like you can be happy.

NAME: ARTHUR
How do you know? What if the
drunker I get the better it is for
me? Not everyone who drinks is a
poet, Susan. Some of us drink
because we're not poets.

NAME: SUSAN
A real woman could stop you from
drinking.

NAME: ARTHUR
It'd have to be a real big woman.

NAME: SUSAN
Ask me, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Susan. Would you marry me? Take the
weekend if you want...

NAME: SUSAN
Yes, I'll marry you.

NAME: WAITER
Ladies and gentleman - the happy
couple!

NAME: SUSAN
Erica will be the planner.

NAME: ARTHUR
Erica? She hates me.

NAME: SUSAN
Who I love, she loves.

NAME: ARTHUR
Oh, come on. She always looks like
she wants to set fire to my face
then put it out with an Uzi.

NAME: ARTHUR
What's going on? I only just bloody
proposed!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
What have I done, Kitt? This
mistake's up there with Hitler
joining his school debating team...

NAME: HOBSON
And stop this self-pitying bibble.
You're going to be fabulously rich.

NAME: ARTHUR
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously
poor. Some poor people I see look
happy.

NAME: HOBSON
That's either because they're far
away or you've just given them
money. Arthur, poor people have to
work. They stand for hours in the
rain, waiting for buses full of
other poor people to take them to
things called `jobs' which they do
all year round to pay for holidays
away from those jobs.

NAME: ARTHUR
Don't patronise me. I have a job.

NAME: HOBSON
Lying drunk on a bale of hay in
riding boots being photographed by
another pampered prick won't
prepare you for the work I mean.
And I don't want to see you suffer.
Take your fish oil.

NAME: RALPH
When are we getting cable?

NAME: RALPH
Honey, that's some bullshit aerial
from the 99 cent Store!

NAME: NAOMI
It's a satellite dish!

NAME: RALPH
I read the box! It said `No
satellite fees to pay because does
not receive satellite signals!'
That's like saying `Hey - eat this
plate of broken glass! It won't
make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'

NAME: NAOMI
It's better than nothing.

NAME: RALPH
No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but
you're even cheaper than your mom.
And she bought food from yard
sales.

NAME: NAOMI
I miss her too, daddy. But now
she's gone and if I'm going to keep
you in grits and Oprah the rest of
your life, you live by my rules.

NAME: RALPH
But you live like you're preparing
for a war. And you earn a decent
salary.

NAME: NAOMI
So? I want to know I can look after
you.

NAME: RALPH
What's he do, this English bum?

NAME: NAOMI
Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.

NAME: RALPH
Yeah and I bet that girl said the
same about her date. Honey, stay
home. I don't want you ending up
like that poor girl.

NAME: NAOMI
A bad actress holding her breath?

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Stop watching CSI.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Or road awareness.

NAME: ARTHUR
Can you put this on please?

NAME: NAOMI
On a first date? Are you crazy?

NAME: ARTHUR
Trust me.

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur. We're in Battery Park at
night. I've met you once - in the
company of your nanny. You make a
disturbing number of jokes about
stalking and basements. My dad
already has you down as a mass
murderer. And you want me to put on
a blindfold?

NAME: ARTHUR
I give you my word - if I kill and
eat you, you'll never see me again.

NAME: NAOMI
Okay, I'm officially a little
worried.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You said you wanted a picnic.

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur, I don't know what to say.
It's beautiful.
Who did all this?

NAME: ARTHUR
The picnic fairies. Who liaised
with the flower fairies, the candle
fairies, the log fire fairies, the
hidden sound system fairies...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
...and the pizza fairies.

NAME: NAOMI
Did you take account of the heroin
fairies who hang here at night?

NAME: ARTHUR
It's nice to keep it simple like
this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
restaurants. All that embarrassing
crap with the specials.

NAME: NAOMI
Are you kidding? Where I normally
eat, the special's the one that
comes with a free toy.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
You're rich rich, aren't you?

NAME: ARTHUR
I get by.

NAME: NAOMI
`It doesn't remotely matter how
much or what you spend it on' rich?

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Craziest thing you ever bought?

NAME: ARTHUR
I once inadvertently financed a
terrorist cell who said they needed
100,000 to open a falafel stall.

NAME: NAOMI
Oh my G-d, you're serious.

NAME: ARTHUR
What's the craziest thing you ever
told a tour party?

NAME: NAOMI
I once said the Manhattan we were
in was actually a movie set built
for `You've got Mail', but that
after the film wrapped, everyone
moved to the set because there was
less crime.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
butter knife about two inches from
his hand but it might take him
eight months to dismember me with
it.
Gotta go, battery. Love you too.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Mom died last year. For eight
months dad ate nothing but Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI. So I persuaded him to move in
with me. Where he eats Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of

NAME: ARTHUR
Sounds like you're very good to
him.

NAME: NAOMI
What are you gonna do? All those
years your folks tucked you in, did
their best to stop you from eating
crap in front of the TV. And then
one day, you're the one saying `No,
honey, it's bad for you! Go to
bed.' Weird, huh?

NAME: ARTHUR
Yeah. I hate that.
Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
find that?

NAME: NAOMI
AT&T store in 1998.

NAME: ARTHUR
It's...You've had it twelve years?

NAME: NAOMI
It's a fine phone. Battery life of
eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
right out of conversations.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
I can't believe these mofos who
gotta keep up with the latest
bullshit. CDs come along, so out
with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
out with the CDs. I just kept the
vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
incredibly hip once every 20
years....

NAME: ARTHUR
I couldn't decide between picnic in
the park and dinner with a view. So
it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
ace?

NAME: NAOMI
No it is not ace, you crazy English
bastard! This is dangerous!

NAME: ARTHUR
Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put
these on.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
So what got you into the walking
tours?

NAME: NAOMI
You're seriously making date small
talk while this is going on?

NAME: ARTHUR
Be still. Breathe deep.
`When you can be calm in the midst
of activity, this is the true state
of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.

NAME: NAOMI
`Lower this freak show to the
ground and get me a cab': Naomi
Snart.

NAME: ARTHUR
Taste this truffle.

NAME: NAOMI
What the hell. Gotta go sometime,
right? At least it won't be years
of pain like mom. Just a few
seconds of screaming and falling
with a truffle in my mouth.

NAME: ARTHUR
So anyway. The tours...

NAME: ARTHUR
What did you write?

NAME: NAOMI
A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
childrens' publisher. Sunshine
Press'. The rejection letter was
the meanest thing I ever read.

NAME: ARTHUR
Kids can be so cruel...

NAME: ARTHUR
I told you, don't worry. These
crane people know what they're
doing!

NAME: NAOMI
Not that kind of problem.

NAME: JUNKIE
Phone. And the watch. Hurry.

NAME: ARTHUR
Um. Out of interest, how did you
get up here?

NAME: JUNKIE
What you talkin' about, dog?

NAME: NAOMI
Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed
by `Robbed in the sky'!

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
This isn't funny, you lunatic.

NAME: ARTHUR
OWWW! You don't understand! We're
180 feet up in the sky!

NAME: ARTHUR
No, we're not high! Well we are,
but only in the literal sense.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hurry!

NAME: NAOMI
I can't find it. Over here?

NAME: ARTHUR
No! That's the bouquet of world
hams!

NAME: ARTHUR
I had fun tonight.

NAME: NAOMI
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but so did I.

NAME: ERICA
Summarising Phase Alpha: formal
wear for bridal attendants, groom's
attendants, mens' formal wear, St
John the Divine all confirmed...

NAME: TAILOR
I'm sorry?

NAME: ARTHUR
In case I'm passed out drunk rather
than medically dead?

NAME: ERICA
Don't worry, Thomas. This whole
thing's just a joke to Arthur.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Take this away.
Progress on the reception?

NAME: ERICA
Black inked at the Emery Roth Room
at the Ritz-Carlton.

NAME: ERICA (CONT'D)
A first pass at the guest list.
Bride's family and friends:

NAME: ERICA (CONT'D)
Groom's family and friends:

NAME: ERICA (CONT'D)
We can arrange to screen off the
area behind your guests, Arthur. To
make it seem less desperate.

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too
colourful and this hangover's a 7.6
on the Richter..the Sickter...

NAME: ERICA
Cakes, caterers, floral
arrangements, photographer...

NAME: HOBSON
Will there be anything else, sir?

NAME: ARTHUR
No, thanks.

NAME: VIVIENNE
No. You can leave.

NAME: ARTHUR
Why all this crap now? What's the
rush anyway?

NAME: BURT
The wedding is in a month, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
A month? I was thinking more sort
of ten, fifteen years. Just to
really enjoy the anticipation of
the big day.

NAME: ERICA
Where are you going?

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower,
Operation Ball and Chain will have
to wait.

NAME: ARTHUR
Here we are.

NAME: NAOMI
We're not going to end up in the
Hudson again, are we?

NAME: ARTHUR
I can promise you won't get wet.

NAME: NAOMI
Are you okay?

NAME: ARTHUR
Yeah, fine. Actually...

NAME: NAOMI
Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go
somewhere really romantic?

NAME: ARTHUR
Everything is 99 cents?

NAME: NAOMI
Yip. A whole penny less than those
bourgeois assholes at the Dollar
Store.

NAME: ARTHUR
`Warning: This product contains
chromium, which may be linked to
chronic bronchitis and reproductive
hazards."

NAME: NAOMI
That one was on the news. Everyone
else recalled them, the pussies.
Not my 99 Cent!

NAME: ARTHUR
Maybe China's trying to wipe out
the west's children one by one.

NAME: NAOMI
Oh, I love this place.

NAME: ARTHUR
Why?

NAME: NAOMI
Well, I'd like you to believe it's
because I'm a poor girl reduced to
buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in-
a-can to Right Said Fred because I
don't know where my next paycheck
is coming from. But the truth is -
bargains get me hot. Got it from
ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?

NAME: ARTHUR
Yes please.

NAME: NAOMI
Looking west, the ladies' hygiene
products. Note that the more
natural-sounding the name, e.g.
this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine
Spray, the more lethal chemicals it
contains. Watch out for the
products cunningly labelled to make
the dumber consumer think they're
getting the real thing: 'Special
J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt
Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup...

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
And ah, the music: Dated sounds for
lonely people to buy cheap shit to.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
I once watched a woman shoplift an
8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her
panty hose to 'Everything I do, I
do it for you'.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Why are you staring at me?

NAME: ARTHUR
Just fascinated.

NAME: NAOMI
You're good at fascinated.

NAME: ARTHUR
You're good at fascinating.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Are you okay? Let me help you.

NAME: OLD WOMAN
Not that one.

NAME: ARTHUR
This one?

NAME: OLD WOMAN
No. There's less beans in it.

NAME: ARTHUR
This one?

NAME: OLD WOMAN
No.

NAME: ARTHUR
This one?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
No. I think I hear a mouse inside.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No
rodents. Packed.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Quick, before someone gets it.

NAME: ARTHUR
Look. Us in a year's time.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
If you got ill, I'd care for you.

NAME: NAOMI
I'll get ill.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get
out when they start playing Phil
Collins. Want to see how to get a
quarter from a shopping cart?

NAME: ERICA
Tiger Woods has confirmed!

NAME: ARTHUR
I didn't know you knew him.

NAME: SUSAN
I don't.

NAME: ARTHUR
Why is he coming?

NAME: SUSAN
He agreed to daddy's fee. This is
going to be the happiest day of my
life!

NAME: SUSAN (CONT'D)
Why is she here all the time?

NAME: ARTHUR
If you can bring Erica, I can bring
Hobson.

NAME: SUSAN
She's my wedding planner.

NAME: ARTHUR
She's my Hobson.

NAME: ARTHUR
Reminiscent of a French castle
perched 500 feet above New York,
the penthouse was known from early
days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.

NAME: NAOMI
A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta
have a second ballroom.

NAME: ARTHUR
Where George Gershwin and the
Astors danced to Shep Fields and
his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred
Austere and Stingy Rogers.

NAME: ARTHUR
Behind the telephone box fish tank.
See you on the balcony.

NAME: NAOMI
Hobson?

NAME: HOBSON
He's not like other men, you know.

NAME: NAOMI
I think I realised that as I
plunged into the Hudson with a
junkie. But I like him. He's fun.

NAME: HOBSON
I know he is. That's the problem.

NAME: NAOMI
What does that mean?

NAME: HOBSON
I'm sure Arthur will explain.

NAME: ARTHUR
Your kids' book. What was it about?

NAME: NAOMI
`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an
asthmatic boy detective.

NAME: ARTHUR
Be serious.

NAME: NAOMI
Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose
Heart Escaped'. It was about this
kid who wakes up to find his heart
has climbed out and is shinning
down the drainpipe to freedom.

NAME: ARTHUR
I love it.

NAME: NAOMI
Rainbow Press said it was too
disturbing. But it wasn't literal -
there wasn't a kid lying there with
a gaping hole in his chest. It was
just this cute little heart
bouncing up and down shouting `You
can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm
paraphrasing.

NAME: ARTHUR
Did he catch the heart?

NAME: NAOMI
Never got that far.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
You like the hooch, don't you?

NAME: ARTHUR
Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
There's this bit in a book Hobson
used to read me as a kid that says
it all: `We must stop eating
cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he
ate another.'

NAME: NAOMI
Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and
Toad!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
So Frog took the box outside. He
shouted in a loud voice, `Hey
birds, here are cookies!' Birds
came from everywhere. They picked
up all the cookies in their beaks
and flew away. `

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Now we have no more cookies to eat'
`Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going
home now to bake a cake.'
Classic addict.

NAME: NAOMI
That was beautiful. It's like you
read it yesterday.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
They ate wet sandwiches without
iced tea. They were two close
friends sitting alone together.

NAME: ARTHUR
I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She
isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my
toad.

NAME: HOBSON
You're quite sure about this?

NAME: ARTHUR
Yes.

NAME: HOBSON
Oh, bollocks.

NAME: RALPH
I don't know, honey. What's this
teabag even doing here? Couldn't he
make it in Lord of the Rings land?

NAME: NAOMI
Not that it matters, but he's a
billionaire.

NAME: RALPH
You have my full permission to
marry him.

NAME: GRANT
Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!

NAME: ARTHUR
I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning
to ride you around the course next.
Her last boyfriend broke his ankle
jumping that ditch. Had to be
destroyed on the spot.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur. What's so urgent that you
had to come all the way out here?

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm in love. With a woman who isn't
exactly who you'd describe as
Susan. She's called Naomi.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur, we've been through this!

NAME: ARTHUR
Won't you at least meet her?

NAME: VIVIENNE
What family is she from?

NAME: ARTHUR
The Snarts of Detroit.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Never heard of them.

NAME: ARTHUR
No, because they're normal. She's a
walking tour guide, her dad's a
retired car worker.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Susan will generate quality sons,
not oil-soaked car monkeys.

NAME: ARTHUR
Unbelievable! Why don't you just
keep me here, pay a servant to wank
me into a bottle once a day...

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur...

NAME: ARTHUR
...then inject it all into a field
of heiresses and see who farts out
a thoroughbred first?

NAME: VIVIENNE
We need an heir!

NAME: ARTHUR
Fine! You can have one with Stevey
Steroids here! Surely even your
uterus has had a face lift by now.

NAME: ARTHUR
None of your business, J Crew.

NAME: GRANT
You are so ungrateful to your
mother. She adores you!

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur. Come back here.

NAME: ARTHUR
You can shove your inheritance up
your horse's arse!

NAME: VIVIENNE
Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your
heart. But do be aware I consider
what you've squandered so far an
advance on your inheritance. That's
about $17 million.

NAME: ARTHUR
Why would you do that? You'd never
get it back.

NAME: VIVIENNE
No. But you'd spend the rest of
your life in court. There's a
simple solution to all this. Marry
Susan. And cheat with the nobody
from Queens.

NAME: NAOMI
Have you been at the cookies?

NAME: ARTHUR
I ate the whole jar.

NAME: NAOMI
Oh, man. What? What?

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm engaged. To another Susan.
Woman. Engaged to another woman.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

NAME: NAOMI
What are you talking about? This is
bullshit. Who do you think you are?
Is this some rich guy thing?

NAME: ARTHUR
I was going to tell you! I just...

NAME: NAOMI
Yeah, yeah, you just.

NAME: ARTHUR
Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it
to get to this! I planned to just
be your friend but then I started
to fall for you and I thought `I
can't marry Susan, I might fall for
Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to
marry Susan or I'll be poor so I
won't fall for Naomi' But then I
did fall for you! Because you're
brainy and funny and gorgeous and
too smart to do walking tours.
You're too smart, Snart. Smart
Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.
Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne,
and I said `I can't marry Susan, I
love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I
don't know any more.

NAME: NAOMI
You're frog.

NAME: ARTHUR
Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if
you don't marry Susan, I'll make
you pay all the inheritance money
back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.
Okay she didn't laugh but she might
as well have, the evil cow. Because
it's like all the money ever and
they'll put not just me but both of
us in prison and your dad, like in
Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and
Oliver and....

NAME: NAOMI
Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of
your personality earlier we
wouldn't be having this
conversation.

NAME: ARTHUR
Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?

NAME: NAOMI
Why?

NAME: ARTHUR
'cause it'll reduce the proportion
of my life I'll spend feeling
utterly miserable.

NAME: NAOMI
Bye, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
Bea Arthur? What's she got to do
with all this?

NAME: NAOMI
It's going to be okay. I'll get you
a beer, yeah?

NAME: RALPH
I just have to be alone for a
minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear
it...

NAME: RUDE MALE TOURIST
Hey. I got a question.

NAME: NAOMI
Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants
to come home with me and butt in
with questions while I'm watching
Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'
Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,
long day. What's your question?

NAME: RUDE MALE TOURIST
How can I just let you walk away,
just let you leave without a trace?

NAME: FEMALE TOURIST
When I stand here taking every
breath with you, ooh...

NAME: MALE TOURIST 2
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.

NAME: NAOMI
What is going on?

NAME: OLD FEMALE TOURIST
How can you just walk away from me,
when all I can do is watch you
leave?

NAME: TEENAGE BOY TOURIST
'cause we've shared the laughter
and the pain...

NAME: NEWSSTAND GUY
And even shared the tears.

NAME: NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.

NAME: ARTHUR
So take a look at me now, 'cause
there's just an empty space.
And there's nothing left here to
remind me, just the memory of your
face.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Take a look at me now, `cause
there's just an empty space, And
you coming back to me is against
all odds and that's what I've got
to face...Just take a look at me
now.

NAME: NAOMI
Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.
he's getting married. But I guess
he didn't choreograph that bit for
you.

NAME: ARTHUR
But..but this took ages to
rehearse. I had the frog outfit
specially made. These aren't actual
tourists.

NAME: NAOMI
I gathered that, Arthur. Are you
capable of doing anything without
it being a grand gesture?

NAME: ARTHUR
What do you mean?

NAME: NAOMI
It's like Hobson said. You're not
like other men. If you were normal,
if the money and the booze didn't
cloud everything, you'd deal with
the fact that you're engaged,
rather than just looking for ways
to win me back. But it was a lovely
routine, really. Fantastic outfit.

NAME: ARTHUR
I just wanted to see you.

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a
haircut! Hobson?

NAME: MARTY
It says here you shouldn't forget
to clean your junk. I guess that's
what...'genitahlio-ah' is.

NAME: ARTHUR
Marty? What are you doing there?

NAME: MARTY
Hobson left me in charge. She's
gone to bed. She had a headache.

NAME: ARTHUR
She's had quite a few headaches
lately.

NAME: MARTY
She blacked out.

NAME: HOBSON
Put my bears back on, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR
Not until you answer my question.

NAME: HOBSON
I'm travelling down a white tunnel.
To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why
is it so hot? Who's the red
gentleman with the big pitchfork?

NAME: ARTHUR
Will you cut it out?

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur. There are three books. This
is important. Take them back to the
library...

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson, please. Don't die any more.
It's getting very boring.

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur. Old women, like bears, get
sore heads. Are you okay? You look
a little lost.

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi doesn't want to see me.

NAME: HOBSON
A terrible shame she had to go. A
little tart like that could have
saved you a fortune in prostitutes.

NAME: ARTHUR
Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk
about Naomi that way again. What
gives you the right to be such a
snob? You're just...you're just...
Mary Poppins with a menopause!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hobson, I've never raised my voice
to you. I'm sorry.

NAME: HOBSON
I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur,
you may be growing up.

NAME: ARTHUR
Do you want anything?

NAME: HOBSON
I want to be younger.

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, it's your job to be older.
Hobson. If you're feeling better
tomorrow, will you accompany me
somewhere?

NAME: HOBSON
Of course, Arthur.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I can't have this getting out. I'm
in the public eye.

NAME: HOBSON
Yes, it would be disastrous to harm
such a dignified profile.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
It's going to be okay, Arthur.

NAME: MEGAN
I was waking up four, five, six
mornings a week in different mens'
beds...

NAME: MEGAN (CONT'D)
I wanted to die. To be nobody.

NAME: JAMES
I steal from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's pedal car so I
could score junk...

NAME: ARTHUR
Jesus....

NAME: JAMES
I accidentally backed my car over
my mother outside Walgreens...

NAME: ARTHUR
Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know
about anyone else, but this isn't
exactly killing my thirst.

NAME: LEADER
Well why did you come...What's your
name?

NAME: ARTHUR
Gandalf.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, you're not going to
convince me my life isn't fun.
And no offence but if I ran over my
mother, I'd be out celebrating.
Which is what I plan to do right
now. Come on, Hobson. Marty.

NAME: HOBSON
...and because I have done nothing
with the astonishing opportunities
handed to me, apart from pissing
away my inheritance and drinking
enough to kill a rhino.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
But imagine being me! I once ended
up in bed with the daughters of
three of the Rolling Stones. But a)
I don't remember a thing about it,
b) apparently I was sick on two of
the women before c) losing control
of my bladder on the third. All
such fun...until the strangers I
pay to be my friends have gone, the
fog parts and there's a hole so
big, you could pour all the
champagne in the world into it and
never fill it up. But I've got so
much potential, a good heart, I'm a
good person, even if I've
completely wasted my short,
precious life because I somehow
convinced myself that happiness is
a Komodo dragon, a case of booze
and the memory of having once
stripped naked to Beethoven for a
coachload of German tourists who I
met outside the Rainforest Cafe.

NAME: ARTHUR
It's always the quiet ones.

NAME: ARTHUR
Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go
every time I crave a drink?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Susan? Look, I know the wedding
date is set. But fancy bringing it
forward? I just want to get it over
with. In a good way. Think about
it, yeah?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
It's the agony of possibility,
Hobson. It just hurts too much to
know I could still be with Naomi if
I had the guts.

NAME: HOBSON
Just promise you'll never ask me to
sleep with Susan for you.

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur, if that's...
Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.
Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty
hard on it..Love to...Love
to...What time?

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
I'll call in dead to work. Bye.

NAME: HOBSON
Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi
here?

NAME: RALPH
You must be the nanny.

NAME: HOBSON
I must be.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
Please stop this, I can't inhale
and am in danger of treading on one
of your knuckles.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
If you and your undershirt would
walk two paces back I could enter
this dwelling.

NAME: NAOMI
Well, well.

NAME: RALPH
Ever since I met Arthur I liked
him. We have to make sure these two
wonderful kids stay together...

NAME: HOBSON
Try not to talk. It's not your
words but the breath which bears
them. Perhaps you could repair to
the East Wing and make me a cup of
tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.

NAME: RALPH
Sure, sure.

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur is having a pre-wedding
party tonight. You should come.

NAME: NAOMI
Oh, should I? Are all the other
girls he passed up going too?

NAME: HOBSON
Don't you want to show Arthur how
well you're doing?

NAME: NAOMI
Tell him thanks, but I have a
deadline.

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's
far too decent to be involved in
something so tawdry. You could
bring your father. A magical
experience before he's too big to
leave this apartment.

NAME: HOBSON
My dear, if there's one thing old
women can tell, it's young men in
love. And the food promises to be
breathtakingly free.

NAME: NAOMI
Are you alright?

NAME: HOBSON
Better than you, dear.

NAME: NAOMI
You really look out for Arthur,
don't you?

NAME: HOBSON
Yes. And it is a job that I
recommend highly.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
You really look out for this
gentleman, from what I've heard.

NAME: NAOMI
Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill
pet shelter won't take him.

NAME: HOBSON
Thank you. Would you go the
bathroom and commence washing? You
only have three hours and it could
be quite a project.

NAME: NAOMI
I appreciate what you're trying to
do but I'm not going to that party.

NAME: HOBSON
Suit yourself.

NAME: NAOMI
Have you seen a doctor?

NAME: HOBSON
Yes. And he has seen me.

NAME: NAOMI
I think Arthur has a very good
friend. May I kiss you on the
cheek?

NAME: HOBSON
Is it something you feel strongly
about?

NAME: NAOMI
Yes.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
Dad! Call 911.

NAME: VOCALIST
Thanks. We're going to move things
up tempo now with `The Only Thing
That Looks Good On Me Is You.'

NAME: VIVIENNE
Splendid affair, Susan.

NAME: SUSAN
Don't thank me, thank Erica.

NAME: NAOMI
With all due respect, Hobson,
you're talking out of your frumpy
English ass. Arthur needs to know!

NAME: HOBSON
You are not to pull him out of that
party on my behalf.
Hello? Naomi!

NAME: RALPH
You're gonna get through this,
babe. Then who knows what the
future may hold?

NAME: DOOR MAN
Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?

NAME: NAOMI
Snart plus one.

NAME: PASSING WOMAN
Nice dress. Vera Wang?

NAME: NAOMI
Ross Dress For Less. You know where
Arthur is?

NAME: BURT
When Arthur proposed to my
daughter, I was overjoyous. The
Bach-Templemeads are my kind of
people: classy. Respectable. Well
spoken. People like in Shakespeare
in Love, who esprouse the same
values I have always upheld both in
my business and spiritual life. But
tonight isn't about me or America's
leading independent formula brand.

NAME: ARTHUR
Thank you, Burt! I've actually
prepared a little surprise song
with my friends here.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Why does cash suddenly appear,
every time you are near?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Just like me, it longs to be, close
to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the
sky, all of which, I can buy...
I'll sing a proper song.
You say potayto and I say potahto,
You say tomayto and I say tomahto,
potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto,
Let's call the whole thing off! You
say AA, and I say `no way', you say
`Red Bull' and I say `Go away,
Rehab, No way, Red Bull...

NAME: JUSTIN
We meet again!

NAME: NAOMI
Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?

NAME: JUSTIN
The ballroom. I'll take you to him.

NAME: JUSTIN (CONT'D)
I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.

NAME: JUSTIN (CONT'D)
Isn't she beautiful?

NAME: NAOMI
Of course she is. Why would Arthur
marry a pig?

NAME: JUSTIN
What business is your family in?

NAME: NAOMI
Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a
fortune built on small pets.

NAME: JUSTIN
I'm sorry?

NAME: NAOMI
Hamsters, mice, doglets...

NAME: JUSTIN
Doglets?

NAME: NAOMI
Tiny dogs. The technology's not
perfect. Seeing a horse the size of
a can of soup fall dead before your
eyes - that shit stays with you.

NAME: NAOMI
Are you sure he's this way?

NAME: JUSTIN
Absolutely.

NAME: NAOMI
Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?

NAME: WOMAN
That way. The ballroom.

NAME: NAOMI
Bye, Justin.

NAME: DOOR MAN
Excuse me, madam. You're not an
authorized guest.

NAME: NAOMI
I know that. I'm here to give
Arthur some very important news.

NAME: DOOR MAN
Of course you are.
Shall we discuss this outside?

NAME: ARTHUR
It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur, can I talk to you?

NAME: MAN IN A WHITE COAT
We ran tests. It was just a dizzy
spell. We'll be sending her home
tonight.

NAME: ARTHUR
But what about the other blackouts?

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that
party.

NAME: ARTHUR
She's fine. They're sending her
home. Do you want a drink?

NAME: NAOMI
No, thanks, Arthur. I should go.

NAME: ARTHUR
But you came all this way. There's
ridiculously fancy food, there's...

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur. Please. Can you just call
me a cab?

NAME: ARTHUR
You're a cab.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Shit. Hobson usually...

NAME: NAOMI
Orders cabs to take the girls away?

NAME: ARTHUR
Thank you for coming all this way.
I'm sorry for all the stupid
presents and calls and gestures.

NAME: NAOMI
It's okay.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
She was a looker from the get-go.

NAME: ARTHUR
What were you like as a kid?

NAME: NAOMI
Nuts. I thought the moon followed
me. I would walk and think the moon
went any place that I did. I
thought it meant something special
would happen. So I've been waiting.
What an ass.

NAME: ARTHUR
Dance?

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur. We've been through this.
Call that cab please.

NAME: MANDY MILLER
To Bombay, a travelling circus
came, they brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her name...

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson used to sing it to me.
One dark night, she slipped her
iron chain. Off she ran to
Hindustan and was never seen again.
Nellie the Elephant packed her
bags, And said goodbye to the
circus, Off she went with a
trumpety trump, Trump trump
trump...

NAME: VIVIENNE
Is this the tour guide?

NAME: ARTHUR
She's a writer.

NAME: NAOMI
Is this the Vivienne?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Crowded field, writing.

NAME: ARTHUR
Maybe someone will see her
potential.

NAME: VIVIENNE
We all know who's seen her
potential.

NAME: NAOMI
Meaning?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Oh, of course, you don't know, do
you?

NAME: ARTHUR
Vivienne, please. Don't...

NAME: NAOMI
What is going on here?

NAME: VIVIENNE
My son became fond of you. You're
not the first. Or the last, I
imagine. Anyway I was scanning his
monthly expenses - which always
makes for entertaining reading, all
those gifts for all those girls -
and found he'd bought an entire
publishing company called...what
was it now? Rainbow Press.

NAME: NAOMI
You bought Rainbow press? So you
could tell them to publish my book?

NAME: VIVIENNE
He knows people, dear. I'm sure you
do too, though the people you know
tend not to own books, let alone
publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll
see you back at the party? Susan's
a little worried.

NAME: ARTHUR
NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I
would ever see you again. I was
just trying to give you some...

NAME: ARTHUR
I do express love! I love you!

NAME: NAOMI
Don't say that!

NAME: ARTHUR
You just told me to! And stop going
on about me being rich! You think
it's easy being trapped by money?

NAME: NAOMI
Hello, Amnesty? Come quick!
Arthur's being held against his
will in Guantamoney Bay!

NAME: ARTHUR
Abu Greed?

NAME: NAOMI
Stop riffing with me! How dare you
do what you did. I didn't need your
money to feel good about myself!

NAME: ARTHUR
No. Being cheap gives you that.

NAME: NAOMI
Huh?

NAME: ARTHUR
At least I'm prepared to have fun.
To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at
me with my antique food, aren't I
cool?' And...and...your phone's
RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old
doorbell and vibrator, I bet you
can only get calls from 1994 on it!

NAME: SUSAN
Hello? I heard shouting.

NAME: NAOMI
I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came
to complain about the conditions.

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi, please...

NAME: NAOMI
Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you
thought putting half and half in
the staff kitchen was an
improvement.
But some people prefer Coffee Mate!
You were disrespectful. I quit!

NAME: SUSAN
Because you changed the creamer?
Arthur, Marty called from the
hospital.

NAME: ARTHUR
It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke
to her doctor.

NAME: SUSAN
Apparently you didn't.

NAME: HOBSON
It's just a headache!

NAME: ARTHUR
Stop saying that! You bribed a
hospital orderly to tell me you
were okay!

NAME: HOBSON
Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors
know?

NAME: ARTHUR
Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing
costly, health-giving presents!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'..
`A compilation of the band's most
stomach-churning music videos and
deathly live performances...'

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Put this on, please.

NAME: HOBSON
I don't want to put it on.

NAME: ARTHUR
Put it on. Or I'll fire you.
Okay, or I won't fire you.

NAME: MARTY
She sounds like Darth Invader!

NAME: HOBSON
Why, Arthur?

NAME: VOICEOVER (CONT'D)
...is determined to catch the
salmon, despite the treacherous
rapids...

NAME: DOCTOR
Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a
moment?

NAME: ARTHUR
Home? That's great news. Isn't it?

NAME: ARTHUR
How did this get here?

NAME: HOBSON
I have no idea.

NAME: ARTHUR
You might have a brain tumour but
you're not a complete veggie burger
just yet. Has Naomi been here?

NAME: HOBSON
She dropped by once or twice.
Frightful needy trollop.

NAME: ARTHUR
I thought she gave up writing.

NAME: HOBSON
Just trying to spare her outright
humiliation while I'm still here.

NAME: ARTHUR
Don't wear yourself out. You're not
going anywhere soon.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
World's most advanced heart rate
monitor. The tiniest problem will
alert your own private platoon of
paramedics camped out downstairs...

NAME: HOBSON
Arthur. I've loved caring for you
so much. But you'll never grow up
with me around. So either I retire.
Or I die. Option 1 involves too
much paperwork and blather with
having to find somewhere else to
live. And no offence to you, dear
boy...

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
...but I think we've exhausted the
bear-based entertainment. Which
leaves option 2.

NAME: HOBSON (CONT'D)
You're a good son, Arthur. You can
do anything with your life that you
want. Just like I did.

NAME: ARTHUR
But you spent half of it looking
after a spoilt drunk twat.

NAME: HOBSON
Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my
use-by date.

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this
one. I need you to care for me.
Now take your fish oil.

NAME: ARTHUR
Hobson?

NAME: HOBSON!
Why the fuck has the stupid thing
not gone off?

NAME: ARTHUR
Would Frog ever get up again? Or
would he just sit in his tank,
crying and soiling himself until he
died of dehydration because he
didn't even have the energy to eat
a wet sandwich.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hobson! Why are you in there when I
need you?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Arrrrgghhh!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Sorry.

NAME: MARTY
How's the tea?

NAME: ARTHUR
Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.

NAME: MARTY
Want to talk about the Cubs game?

NAME: ARTHUR
Nahhh. Can I be alone please?

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get
this, because your voicemail
probably consists of a 4000 year
old woman who writes the message
down in hieroglyphics then loses it
down the back of her incontinence
loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson
died and I've fallen apart...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur! You haven't answered the
phone for eight days. Susan's
beside herself. What's going on?

NAME: ARTHUR
What do you think's going on?
Hobson died.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Oh, that.

NAME: ARTHUR
You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Well, yes. A faithful, humble
companion who...

NAME: ARTHUR
Um, I think I'd like you to leave,
if that's okay. Now?

NAME: VIVIENNE
Remember who pays for this
apartment, Arthur. For everything!

NAME: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
You had damn well better be at that
wedding, boy.

NAME: ARTHUR
Don't worry. If I'm going to drink
myself to death I'll need
resources. Bye Vivienne...

NAME: VIVIENNE
It's mother!

NAME: ARTHUR
My mother's dead.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hello? I'm sorry?

NAME: AHERNE
The last will and testament of Jane
Hobson.
`I leave my life savings to the
Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare
County, California.'

NAME: ARTHUR
That'll explain the strong smell of
bear shit. Sorry.

NAME: AHERNE
To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave
this.

NAME: AHERNE (CONT'D)
To operate kettle, press red
button. Milk in refrigerator;
that's the big box with the pretty
light that comes on when you open
the door.
Arthur. You're going to be okay.
Now it's your turn to look after
someone. All my deepest, fondest
love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling
down at you - or more likely, up at
you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx.

NAME: BURT
I just want you to know, if he
doesn't show up for this wedding, I
can't know what I'll do.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned
himself up. He's stopped drinking,
he's anxious to get a real job.
He's become a responsible citizen.

NAME: NAOMI
Due to a tragic error in the
architect's drawing, the original
Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886
was just seven inches tall. 100,000
New Yorkers rioted, having come
expecting to see something more
impressive than a garden gnome
holding up an ice cream...

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
You're on a bus? With a microphone?

NAME: NAOMI
Girl's gotta have a dream.

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi. Can you take the next 60
years off?

NAME: NAOMI
Are you okay? You're a mess. You
look like you...now.

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry. I accidentally swallowed
three bottles of hand sanitizer.
Fascinating story...Okay.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Drinking was the only way I could
get the courage to come here and
say this: I don't need the money. I
love the money. But I don't lie
awake all night wondering how I'll
live without ever seeing it again.
I just wonder what it's like to go
24 hours without a steak tartare.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
The American Express Centurion card

$250,000 a year to keep it, which I
blow in a quiet week.

I'm so sorry about Hobson.

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.

NAME: NAOMI
It's okay. So how did Susan take it
that you're not marrying her?

NAME: ARTHUR
She didn't.

NAME: NAOMI
You haven't told her?

NAME: ARTHUR
What's it to you? She's your arch-
enemy.

NAME: NAOMI
Are you six? She isn't my enemy.
She's the woman you proposed to!

NAME: ARTHUR
I couldn't tell her! Today's the
biggest day of her life!

NAME: NAOMI
The wedding's today? When?

NAME: ARTHUR
12. Which is...
Where's my watch gone?

NAME: NAOMI
It's eight minutes to.

NAME: ARTHUR
It's too late, then.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I don't know her number! It's in my
phone's address book in that gloop.

NAME: NAOMI
Church?

NAME: ARTHUR
St. John the Divine. Can we please
just get me some clothes...

NAME: NAOMI
St John..Fourth largest church in
the world...111th and Amsterdam.
It's about four miles. Better
hurry.

NAME: ARTHUR
You want me to go there? Like this?

NAME: NAOMI
What's the alternative? Jilt Susan
at the altar? Can I expect the same
treatment when you dump me?

NAME: ARTHUR
No! I love you!

NAME: NAOMI
C'mon, folks...

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi! Susan's dad will...

NAME: NAOMI
Arthur. Prove you're not the same
pampered little boy who can have
what he wants then toss it aside
when he's bored. Then we'll talk.

NAME: ARTHUR
Naomi! I don't even know the way!

NAME: NAOMI
5th...right on Broadway...left at
Times...Right on 7th...back on
Broadway....right on Amsterdam. The
church is the big stone pointy
thing full of rich people.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Um, can anyone spare...
How much to St. John the Divine
please?

NAME: DRIVER
About 15 bucks...

NAME: ARTHUR
Can anyone spare $15 please?

NAME: PASSERBY
Yes.

NAME: ARTHUR
Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother
you, but...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Crikey. Thanks.

NAME: NAOMI
...originally a rough
neighbourhood. Some say it was
called 42nd Street because it
wasn't safe to spend more than
forty seconds on it.

NAME: MALE TOURIST
Excuse me.

NAME: NAOMI
If you burst into song, you're off
this bus.

NAME: MALE TOURIST
Huh? I want to see St. John the
Divine.

NAME: NAOMI
Sorry, sir, that's not on our route
today. Anyway...

NAME: FEMALE TOURIST
I want to know if Arthur's gonna
make it.

NAME: OTHER FEMALE TOURIST (CONT'D)
You should be there for him.

NAME: ALL OTHER TOURISTS
So do I! St. John the Divine, St.
John the Divine, St. John the...

NAME: NAOMI
Okay!

NAME: ARTHUR
Ah! I'm trying to get to...

NAME: MANAGER
Hey!

NAME: ARTHUR
I'm not him.
Look ma! No holes.

NAME: SUSAN
Arthur? What's going on?

NAME: ARTHUR
Susan. I can't...I can't...

NAME: SUSAN
What?

NAME: ARTHUR
The girl at the party? The one who
talked all that rubbish about
Coffee Mate? I love her.

NAME: SUSAN
Shut up! We're getting married!

NAME: ARTHUR
But I don't love you!

NAME: SUSAN
And you think I love you?

NAME: ARTHUR
Well, yes. What's not to...

NAME: SUSAN
I never have.

NAME: ARTHUR
Susan, you're upset, you hate me.
It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to
go, or your dad's going to do
whatever he did to your boyfriend
from college.

NAME: SUSAN
Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her
parents to send her away..

NAME: ARTHUR
HER? You're..a...

NAME: SUSAN
Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed
that daddy is homophobic. He swore
he'd disown me if it happened
again.

NAME: ARTHUR
But...why do you want to marry...

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Hang on. Am I your beard?

NAME: SUSAN
Why else do you think I'd spend
more than 30 seconds in your
company? You're the perfect cover.

NAME: SUSAN
No.

NAME: ARTHUR
Wow. Wow. Well. Uh...
Thanks for your honesty. I don't
feel so bad about calling this off.

NAME: SUSAN
Arthur, please. You can drink as
much as you like, sneak off to
Naomi. We keep the money. We live
our lives. Everyone wins.

NAME: ARTHUR
I may be a weak, pathetic drunk.
But I won't marry a lesbian Dane
Cook fan.

NAME: ARTHUR
Good evening, St. John the Divine!
Anyone in from St. Patrick's?
Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan
Mosque? AA?

NAME: ARTHUR
...and the first turned to the
second horse and said `That dog
just spoke'.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
The joke being that it's
inconsistent that the horses can
speak but the dog can't.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
The wedding's off. The bride has
had second thoughts. I can't say I
blame her. Would you marry me?

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Great. I'm glad we had this talk.
I'll let you get on with the
wedding....

NAME: SUSAN
Daddy, no! Stop it!

NAME: VIVIENNE
Burt! Get off my son!

NAME: SUSAN
NAME: BURT
You wouldn't hurt me.

NAME: SUSAN
Wouldn't I? You crushed me.

NAME: BURT
I just wanted you to be happy.

NAME: SUSAN
Bullshit. You wanted to stop me
being a lesbian!

NAME: BURT
Shut up! Shut up you dirty little
dyke harlot!

NAME: ERICA
You want some more, bitch? Huh?

NAME: SUSAN
Erica, that's enough, honey.

NAME: ARTHUR
Why didn't you tell me? We could
have worked something out.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
I'm joking.

NAME: ARTHUR
OW! Stop it! Why are you doing
that?

NAME: NAOMI
Because I hate an infection! Keep
still.

NAME: ARTHUR
No, you keep still.

NAME: NAOMI
What are we going to do, Arthur?

NAME: ARTHUR
I'll get a job. I'll model cheap
riding boots for people with no
horses. You can write books about
boys whose lungs have run away.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Stop this!

NAME: VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
A Bach-Templemead has never been
poor and we're not about to try
that experiment with you, Arthur.
That said, you've shown strength of
character for once, instead of
blubbing on about frogs and
friendship. The inheritance is
yours. All I ask is, with Hobson
gone, you finally start treating me
like a mother.

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.

NAME: VIVIENNE
I beg your pardon?

NAME: ARTHUR
You've never earned that title. I
wouldn't fake it with Susan. I
won't with you.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur. I will withdraw this offer
forever. Don't doubt me, boy.

NAME: ARTHUR
I don't.

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
Take care, Viv.

NAME: VIVIENNE
Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If
you walk out of that door...

NAME: ARTHUR
Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any
more. Fancy joining us for a bowl
of Special J?

NAME: ARTHUR
Operational heat controls in a
shower are a basic human right!

NAME: ARTHUR (CONT'D)
What the hell's in this shampoo?
Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea
tree oil...

NAME: RALPH
Package for you. With any luck an
apartment for you and Lurch.

NAME: ARTHUR
I thought you liked me.

NAME: RALPH
I may have been seduced by money.
It happens.

NAME: ARTHUR
`Can I be your friend at least?
Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch
sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is
yours. It always was.'

NAME: RALPH
On balance, I'd go for it.

NAME: MARTY
Money good.

NAME: NAOMI
You were never happy rich, honey.
It's only been a month. Be strong.
Remember: however hard life gets,
love will always find a way.

NAME: NAOMI (CONT'D)
What? Can't a girl make a joke?

NAME: ARTHUR
Brought her for moral support. But
I'll do the talking this time.

NAME: NARRATOR
Thebes. City of the Living. Crown
jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

NAME: NARRATOR
Home of Imhotep, High Priest of
Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

NAME: NARRATOR
Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's
Mistress. No other man was allowed
to touch her.

NAME: NARRATOR
But for our love, we were willing to
risk life itself.

NAME: PHARAOH
What are you doing here?

NAME: PHARAOH
Imhotep?... My priest.

NAME: PRIESTS
Pharaoh's bodyguards!

NAME: ANCK-SU-NAMUN
You must go. Save yourself. Only you
can resurrect me.

NAME: ANCK-SU-NAMUN
My body is no longer his temple!

NAME: NARRATOR/IMHOTEP
For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's
body was to be cursed. And it was I,
the High Priest, whose duty it was
to curse it.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Her body was mummified, her vital
organs removed and placed in sacred
canopic jars.

NAME: IMHOTEP
The Book of The Living contained
sacred incantations that would send
the evil dead on a journey into the
dark underworld.

NAME: IMHOTEP
The slaves were killed...

NAME: IMHOTEP
...and the soldiers who killed them
were also slain, so that no unholy
person should ever know the exact
location of the burial site.

NAME: IMHOTEP
But there was another book, The Book
Of The Dead, which was never to be
opened, never to be read, for it
contained the incantations that could
bring a dead body back to life a
most unholy thing.

NAME: IMHOTEP
It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of
the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis,
so that no such sacrilege might ever
disgrace Egypt.

NAME: IMHOTEP
But for my love of Anck-su-namun I
was willing to defy the gods.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Anck-su-namun's vital organs were
still fresh, so a human sacrifice
would not need be made.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Anck-su-namun soul had come back
from the dead! Now all that was
needed, was to return her organs to
their rightful place within her body.

NAME: IMHOTEP
My Priests were condemned to be
mummified alive.

NAME: IMHOTEP
As for me, I was condemned to endure
the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient
curses. One so horrible, it had never
before been bestowed.

NAME: IMHOTEP
By eating the sacred scarabs, I would
be cursed to stay alive forever. And
by eating me, they were cursed just
the same.

NAME: IMHOTEP
I was to remain sealed inside my
sarcophagus, the undead for all of
eternity.

NAME: IMHOTEP
They would never allow me to be
released. For I would arise a walking
disease, a plague upon mankind, an
unholy flesh-eater, with the strength
of ages, power over the sands, and
the glory of invincibility.

NAME: IMHOTEP
And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
su-namun from her place in hell,
together, we would be an unstoppable
infection upon this world. The
Apocalypse. The End.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I knew this was gonna be a lousy
day.

NAME: BENI
Personally, I would like to surrender.
Why can we not just surrender?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

NAME: BENI
Then let's run away. Right now. While
we can still make it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Now gimme your revolver, you'll never
use it anyway.

NAME: BENI
Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody
ever does that anymore.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Now go find me a big stick.

NAME: BENI
In the desert? What for?

NAME: O'CONNELL
So I can tie it to your back, you
appear to be without a spine.

NAME: O'CONNELL
How'd a guy like you end up in the
Legion anyways?

NAME: BENI
I got caught robbing a synagogue.
Lots of good stuff in them holy
places; churches, temples, mosques,
and who's guarding them?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Altar boys?

NAME: BENI
Exactly! I speak seven languages,
including Hebrew, so my specialty
was synagogues. How about you? Kill
somebody?

NAME: O'CONNELL
No, but I'm considering it.

NAME: BENI
What then? Robbery? Extortion?
Kidnapping!

NAME: O'CONNELL
None of the above, thank you.

NAME: BENI
Then what the hell are you doing
here!?

NAME: O'CONNELL
I was just looking for a good time.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Oh shit. Steady!

NAME: STEADY!
What the hell am I sayin'?

NAME: STEADY!!
What the hell am I doin'?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Son-of-a-bitch.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Hey! Beni! Wait up!

NAME: O'CONNELL
What are ya doing?! Wait up!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU

NAME: O'CONNELL
I'm gonna get you for this!

NAME: EVELYN
Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up
here?

NAME: EVELYN
Oops.

NAME: CURATOR
Look at this! Sons of the Messiah!
Give me frogs, flies, locusts,
anything but this! Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

NAME: EVELYN
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

NAME: CURATOR
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it
was an accident. You are a
catastrophe! Why do I put up with
you?

NAME: EVELYN
You put up with me, because I can
read and write ancient Egyptian,
decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic,
and I'm the only person within a
thousand miles who knows how to
properly code and catalogue this
library.

NAME: CURATOR
Who needs smart women? I put up with
you because your mother and father
were our finest patrons, Allah rest
their souls. Now straighten up this
mess!

NAME: EVELYN
Hello?

NAME: EVELYN
Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

NAME: EVELYN
You...! YOU...!

NAME: JONATHAN
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please
call me something original.

NAME: EVELYN
Have you no respect for the dead?

NAME: JONATHAN
Right now, I only wish to join them.

NAME: EVELYN
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather
than later, before you ruin my career
the way you've ruined yours.

NAME: JONATHAN
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll
have you know, that at this moment
my career is on a high note.

NAME: EVELYN
High note? Ha! For five years you've
been scrounging around Egypt, and
what have you to show for it? Nothing.

NAME: JONATHAN
Oh yes I do! I have something right
here!

NAME: EVELYN
Oh no, not another worthless trinket,
Jonathan, if I bring one more piece
of junk to the Curator to try and
sell for you.

NAME: EVELYN
Where did you get this?

NAME: JONATHAN
On a dig, down in Thebes.

NAME: JONATHAN
My whole life I've never found
anything, Evy. Tell me I've found
something.

NAME: EVELYN
Jonathan?

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes?

NAME: EVELYN
I think you found something.

NAME: EVELYN
See the cartouche there, it's the
official royal seal of Seti the First,
I'm sure of it.

NAME: CURATOR
Perhaps.

NAME: JONATHAN
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti
the First? And was he rich?

NAME: EVELYN
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old
Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest
Pharaoh of them all.

NAME: JONATHAN
Alright, good, that's good. I like
this fellow, like him very much.

NAME: EVELYN
I've already dated it, this map is
almost four thousand years old. And
the hieratics over here...
It's Hamunaptra.

NAME: CURATOR
My dear girl, don't be ridiculous,
we are scholars, not treasure hunters.
Hamunaptra is a myth.

NAME: JONATHAN
Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the
early Pharaohs were said to have
hidden the wealth of Egypt.

NAME: JONATHAN
Right, right, in a big underground
treasure chamber. Everybody knows
the story. The entire necropolis was
rigged to sink into the sand. On
Pharaoh's command, a flick of the
switch! And the whole place could
disappear beneath the dunes.

NAME: EVELYN
All we know is that the city
mysteriously vanished around 2,134

NAME: CURATOR
As the Americans would say: it's all
fairy tales and hokum.

NAME: JONATHAN
You burned it! You burned off the
part with the lost city!

NAME: CURATOR
It's for the best, I'm sure. Many
men have wasted their lives in the
foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no
one has ever found it, most have
never returned.

NAME: JONATHAN
You killed my map.

NAME: CURATOR
I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm
surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to
be so fooled.

NAME: EVELYN
You told me you found it on a dig
down in Thebes!

NAME: JONATHAN
I was mistaken.

NAME: EVELYN
You lied to me!

NAME: JONATHAN
I lie to everybody, what makes you
so special?

NAME: EVELYN
I'm your sister.

NAME: JONATHAN
That just makes you more gullible.

NAME: EVELYN
You stole it from a drunk at the
local Casbah?!

NAME: JONATHAN
Picked his pocket, actually.

NAME: EVELYN
And what is he in prison for?

NAME: WARDEN
I did not know, so when I heard you
were coming, I asked him that myself.

NAME: EVELYN
And what did he say?

NAME: WARDEN
He said... he was just looking for a
good time.

NAME: EVELYN
But he's just a filthy criminal?

NAME: JONATHAN
Way to go, Evy.

NAME: O'CONNELL
So who's the broad?

NAME: EVELYN
Broad?!

NAME: JONATHAN
She's my sister, actually.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a
total loss.

NAME: WARDEN
I'll be back in a moment.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I tremble with anticipation.

NAME: EVELYN
We uh,... found... your puzzle box,
and we've come to ask you about it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
No.

NAME: EVELYN
No?

NAME: O'CONNELL
No... You came to ask me about
Hamunaptra.

NAME: EVELYN
How do you know the box pertains to
Hamunaptra?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Because that's where I found it. I
was there.

NAME: JONATHAN
How do we know that's not a load of
pig swallow?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Hey,... don't I know you?

NAME: JONATHAN
Um, well, you see...

NAME: EVELYN
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

NAME: O'CONNELL
I just decked your brother

NAME: EVELYN
Yes, well...
I know my brother.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah, I was there.

NAME: EVELYN
You swear?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Every damn day.

NAME: EVELYN
No, I mean --

NAME: O'CONNELL
-- I know what you mean. I was there,
alright. Seti's place. The City Of
The Dead.

NAME: EVELYN
What did you find? What did you see?

NAME: O'CONNELL
I found sand. I saw death.

NAME: EVELYN
Could you tell me how to get there?
The exact location?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Want to know?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Really want to know?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Then get me the hell outta here.

NAME: EVELYN
Where are they taking him?

NAME: WARDEN
To be hanged.

NAME: WARDEN
Apparently, he had a very good time.

NAME: WARDEN
No women allowed.

NAME: EVELYN
I am an English woman.

NAME: EVELYN
I will give you one hundred pounds
to spare his life.

NAME: WARDEN
I would pay one hundred pounds just
to see him hang.

NAME: EVELYN
Two hundred pounds.

NAME: WARDEN
Proceed!

NAME: EVELYN
Three hundred pounds!

NAME: HANGMAN
Any last requests, pig?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

NAME: WARDEN
And what else?

NAME: WARDEN
His neck did not break! Good! Now we
watch him strangle to death.

NAME: EVELYN
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

NAME: WARDEN
You lie.

NAME: EVELYN
I would never!

NAME: WARDEN
Are you saying this filthy godless
son of a pig knows where to find The
City Of The Dead? Truly?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes and if you cut him down, we will
give you ten percent.

NAME: WARDEN
Fifty percent.

NAME: EVELYN
Twenty.

NAME: WARDEN
Forty.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--

NAME: EVELYN
Twenty-five percent, and not one
single farthing more.

NAME: CURATOR
She must die.

NAME: HOOK
She is like all the others. She will
die in the desert.

NAME: CURATOR
No! She has seen too much. She knows
too much.

NAME: CURATOR
Not only does she have a map, but
she has the key.

NAME: HOOK
The key!? She has the lost key!?

NAME: CURATOR
Yes. No one has ever had so much,
been so close. We must stop her, or
it will be the end of us all.

NAME: HOOK
Then we will kill her, we will kill
her and all those with her.

NAME: CURATOR
And burn the map and retrieve the
key.

NAME: HOOK
It will be done. But what of the
American expedition? They leave
tomorrow as well.

NAME: CURATOR
Forget the bumbling Americans, they
will be like all the others. Without
the map to guide them, how can they
possibly find Hamunaptra?

NAME: BENI
It is three days down the Nile, then
two days by camel, sahibs.

NAME: DANIELS
For all the money we're paying you,
something better god-damned well be
under that sand.

NAME: HENDERSON
"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya
gotta keep sayin, to yourself,
"Hamunaptra."

NAME: EVELYN
Do you really think he'll show up?

NAME: JONATHAN
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he
may be a cowboy, but his word is his
word.

NAME: EVELYN
Personally, I think he's filthy,
rude and a complete scoundrel. I
don't like him one bit.

NAME: EVELYN
Oh... um,... hello.

NAME: JONATHAN
Smashing day for the start of an
adventure, eh, O'Connell?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah, sure, smashing.

NAME: BURNS
You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

NAME: BENI
Along with the scorched bones of my
entire garrison, sahib.

NAME: BENI
A thousand pardons, my good sahibs
but there is much work to be done.

NAME: EVELYN
Mister O'Connell, can you look me in
the eye, and guarantee me this is
not some sort of flimflam? Because
if it is, I'm warning you --

NAME: O'CONNELL
All I can tell you, miss, is that my
Colonel found that map in an ancient
fortress, and the whole damn garrison
believed in it so much, that without
orders, we marched halfway across
Libya and into Egypt to find that
city. Like I told ya, all I saw was
sand. Everybody else was wiped out
by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your
bags.

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude,
a complete scoundrel, nothing to
like there at all.

NAME: WARDEN
A bright good morning to all.

NAME: EVELYN
What are you doing here?

NAME: WARDEN
I have come to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

NAME: JONATHAN
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we
could use another good player.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I only gamble with my life, never my
money.

NAME: DANIELS
Never? What if I were to wager five
hundred dollars says we get to
Hamunaptra before you?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yer on.

NAME: BURNS
What makes you so confident, sir?

NAME: O'CONNELL
What makes you?

NAME: HENDERSON
We got us a man who's actually been
there.

NAME: JONATHAN
I say, what a coincidence, why --

NAME: JONATHAN
-- whose deal is it? Is it my deal?
I thought I just dealt?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

NAME: EVELYN
The only thing that scares me, Mister
O'Connell, are your manners.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

NAME: EVELYN
If you call that a kiss.

NAME: EVELYN
Did I miss something? Are we going
into battle?

NAME: O'CONNELL
The last time I was at that place
everybody I was with died.

NAME: O'CONNELL
There's something out there, you
know, something under that sand.

NAME: EVELYN
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain
artifact, a book, actually, my brother
thinks there's treasure. What do you
think is out there?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,
they call it, "the doorway to hell."

NAME: EVELYN
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to
the underworld", actually.

NAME: EVELYN
I don't believe in fairy tales and
hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do
believe that one of the most famous
books in history is buried out there,
The Book Of The Living. It's what
first interested me in Egypt as a
child. It's why I came here, sort of
a life's pursuit.

NAME: O'CONNELL
And the fact that they say it's made
out of pure gold, makes no nevermind
to you, right?

NAME: EVELYN
You know your history.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I know my treasure.

NAME: EVELYN
By the way,... why did you kiss me?

NAME: O'CONNELL
I was about to be hanged, seemed
like a good idea at the time.

NAME: O'CONNELL
What?... Wha'd I say?

NAME: BENI
My very good friend! What a surprise.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Why if it ain't my little buddy,
Beni. I oughta kill you.

NAME: BENI
You never were any good with the
ladies, O'Connell.

NAME: O'CONNELL
So you're the one leading the
Americans, I shoulda figured. So
what's the scam? You get 'em out in
the middle of the desert then leave
'em to rot?

NAME: BENI
Unfortunately no, these Americans
are smart, they pay me only half
now, half when I get them back to
Cairo, so I must go all the way.

NAME: BENI
You never believed in Hamunaptra,
O'Connell. Why are you going back?
The devil himself lives out there.

NAME: O'CONNELL
The girl saved my life, figured it
was the least I could do, keep her
out of trouble.

NAME: BENI
You always did have more balls than
brains.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Let's make us even, shall we?

NAME: BENI
Even?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Sounds familiar.

NAME: HOOK
Where is the map?

NAME: HOOK
And the key? Where is the key?

NAME: HOOK
Then I'll find it myself.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Friend of yours?

NAME: EVELYN
The map! We need the map!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Relax! I'm the map!
It's all up here.

NAME: EVELYN
Oh that's comforting.

NAME: O'CONNELL
C'mon, there's still one more of
those guys around here somewhere.

NAME: JONATHAN
Hey that's mine --

NAME: O'CONNELL
Can you swim?

NAME: EVELYN
Well of course I can swim, if the
occasion calls for it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Trust me.

NAME: O'CONNELL
The occasion calls for it.

NAME: JONATHAN
Americans.

NAME: JONATHAN
I say! Good show!

NAME: JONATHAN
And did I panic?

NAME: JONATHAN
I think not.

NAME: BENI
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I
got all the horses!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on
the wrong side of the river!

NAME: JONATHAN
I can't believe the price of these
fleabags.

NAME: O'CONNELL
We coulda had 'em for free, all we
had to do was give 'em your sister.

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Awfully.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Then again...

NAME: JONATHAN
Never did like camels. Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.
Disgusting.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah, disgusting.

NAME: EVELYN
Well I think they're cute.

NAME: JONATHAN
And you snore!

NAME: WARDEN
I do not snore!

NAME: JONATHAN
All night you snored!

NAME: WARDEN
I have never snored!

NAME: O'CONNELL
We're almost there.

NAME: EVELYN
Are you sure?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Pretty sure.

NAME: JONATHAN
What in bloody hell is this?

NAME: WARDEN
Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

NAME: BENI
Good morning, my friend!

NAME: DANIELS
Well, what the hell we doin'?

NAME: BENI
Patience, my good sahib, patience.

NAME: HENDERSON
First one to the city, O'Connell!
Five hundred! Cash bucks!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Get ready.

NAME: EVELYN
For what?

NAME: O'CONNELL
We're about to be shown the way.

NAME: JONATHAN
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't
we be going?

NAME: EVELYN
After all, you rode us night and day
to win that bet.

NAME: BENI
Fools.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Evelyn! Slow down!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Never mind.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

NAME: DANIELS
Where'd all these camels come from?

NAME: BENI
They belong to the dead. They will
wait years for their masters to return
before leaving.

NAME: JONATHAN
That thing gives me the creeps.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Be nice. That thing saved my life.

NAME: EVELYN
That "thing" gets me excited.

NAME: O'CONNELL
The things that get you excited.

NAME: EVELYN
According to Bembridge Scholars,
inside the statue of Anubis was a
secret compartment, perhaps containing
The Book Of The Living.

NAME: O'CONNELL
What are those mirrors for?

NAME: EVELYN
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

NAME: EVELYN
Do you realize, we are standing inside
a room that no one has entered in
over four thousand years.

NAME: WARDEN
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You're welcome to my share of the
spider webs.

NAME: JONATHAN
And it stinks to high heaven in here.

NAME: EVELYN
Cretins.

NAME: DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT
RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's
chamber.

NAME: O'CONNELL
That is a neat trick.

NAME: EVELYN
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Preparation for what?

NAME: EVELYN
For entering the afterlife.

NAME: JONATHAN
Mummies, my good son, this is where
they made the mummies.

NAME: HENDERSON
Ya scared the bejeezus out of us,
O'Connell.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Likewise.

NAME: DANIELS
This here is our statue,... friend.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Don't see your name on it,... pal.

NAME: BENI
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are
no-so-good.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I've had worse.

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes, me too.

NAME: EVELYN
Let's be nice, children, if we're
going to play together, we must learn
to share.

NAME: EVELYN
According to my calculations, we
should be right under the statue.
We'll come up right between his legs.
Oh my.

NAME: JONATHAN
And when those dirty Yanks go to
sleep --
No offense.

NAME: O'CONNELL
None taken.

NAME: JONATHAN
We'll sneak up and steal that book
right out from under them.

NAME: O'CONNELL
And you're sure you can find the
secret compartment?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't
already found it.

NAME: JONATHAN
I say, what's our smelly little friend
got himself up to?

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
Seti was no fool.

NAME: HENDERSON
Yeah, sure...

NAME: HENDERSON
We'll let him open it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Lemme get this straight, they stuck
a sharp, red hot poker up your nose,
cut your brain into small pieces,
then ripped it all out through your
nostrils?

NAME: JONATHAN
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

NAME: EVELYN
It's called mummification. You're
dead when they do this

NAME: JONATHAN
Still...

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

NAME: EVELYN
You two are worse than a couple of
schoolboys.

NAME: -- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS
THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

NAME: EVELYN
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks
like a sarcophagus.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Why would they bury somebody in the
ceiling?

NAME: EVELYN
They didn't, they buried him at the
foot of Anubis. He was either someone
of great importance. Or he did
something very naughty.

NAME: JONATHAN
Well?... Who is it?

NAME: EVELYN
'He that shall not be named.'

NAME: O'CONNELL
There's some sort of lock here. You
say these thing's are made of granite
with a steel interior?

NAME: EVELYN
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

NAME: JONATHAN
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting
out.

NAME: O'CONNELL
No kiddin', without a key, it'll
take us a month to crack this thing,

NAME: EVELYN
A key! That's it! That's what he was
talking about.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Who was talking about what?

NAME: EVELYN
The man on the barge. The one with
the hook, he was looking for a key.

NAME: JONATHAN
Hey that's mine!

NAME: EVELYN
What do you suppose killed him?

NAME: JONATHAN
Did you ever see him eat?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Seems the Americans had a little
misadventure of their own today,
three of their diggers were killed.

NAME: EVELYN
How?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.
Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

NAME: JONATHAN
Maybe this place really is cursed.

NAME: EVELYN
You two!

NAME: O'CONNELL
You don't believe in curses, huh?

NAME: EVELYN
No. I believe if I can see it and I
can touch it, then it's real. That's
what I believe.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I believe in being prepared.

NAME: JONATHAN
Seagrams!

NAME: JONATHAN
Well, he may have been a stinky
fellow,... but he had good taste.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Stay here!

NAME: JONATHAN
Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man
just say -- !

NAME: O'CONNELL
Goin' somewhere?

NAME: BENI
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I
wanted to be with my friend!

NAME: O'CONNELL
C'mon, friend.

NAME: BENI
Why do you like to fight so much?

NAME: O'CONNELL
'Cause I look good doin, it.

NAME: JONATHAN
Let 'em have it, boys!

NAME: JONATHAN
I say, bloody good show.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You alright?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes,... fine,... thank you.

NAME: DANIELS
See! That proves it! Old Seti's
fortune's gotta be under this sand!

NAME: HENDERSON
For them to protect it like this,
you just know there's got to be
treasure down there.

NAME: O'CONNELL
These men are a desert people. They
value water, not gold.

NAME: EVELYN
Where's Jonathan?

NAME: EVELYN
Unlike my brother, sir, I know when
to say no.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I
don't get. You're a whole new brew.

NAME: EVELYN
I know, you're wondering, what's a
place like me doing in a girl like
this?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Something like that.

NAME: EVELYN
Egypt is in my blood. My father was
a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so
much that he married an Egyptian. My
mother! Who was quite an adventurer
herself

NAME: O'CONNELL
Okay, I get your father, I get your
mother and I get your brother, but
what are you doing here?

NAME: EVELYN
I may not be an explorer, or an
adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or
a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But
I'm proud of what I am.

NAME: O'CONNELL
And what is that?

NAME: EVELYN
...I am a librarian!

NAME: EVELYN
I'm going to kiss you, Mister
O'Connell.

NAME: O'CONNELL
No you're not.

NAME: EVELYN
I'm not?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Not unless you call me Rick.

NAME: EVELYN
Why would I do that?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Because that's my name.

NAME: EVELYN
I can't believe I allowed the two of
you to get me drunk.

NAME: JONATHAN
Don't blame me, I don't even remember
being there.

NAME: EVELYN
Well neither do I, thank you.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You don't?

NAME: EVELYN
No... Why?... Should I?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the
best time you ever had.

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
There is a curse upon this chest.

NAME: DANIELS
Curse my ass.

NAME: HENDERSON
Yeah, who cares.

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
In these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times, is
as strong today, as it was then.

NAME: HENDERSON
Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
"Death will come on swift wings to
whomever opens this chest".

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
It says, there is one, the undead,
who if brought back to life, is bound
by sacred law to consummate this
curse.

NAME: HENDERSON
Yeah, well, let's just make sure we
don't bring anybody back from the
dead then, huh?

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
He will kill all who open this
chest,... and assimilate their organs
and fluids.

NAME: DANIELS
Assimilate their organs and fluids?
Ya mean eat 'em?

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
And in so doing he will regenerate.
And no longer be the undead, but a
plague upon this earth.

NAME: HENDERSON
Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

NAME: EVELYN
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this
ever since I was a little girl.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You dream about dead guys?

NAME: EVELYN
Look, all the sacred spells have
been chiseled off. The hieratics and
hieroglyphs that protect the deceased
on his journey into the afterlife,
they've been removed. This man was
cursed,... doomed.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Tough break.

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see
who's inside, shall we?

NAME: BENI
The curse,... beware the curse!

NAME: DANIELS
Stupid superstitious bastard.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Is he supposed to look like that?

NAME: EVELYN
No. I've never seen a mummy look
like this. He's, he's still...

NAME: JONATHAN
Juicy?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes. He's more than four thousand
years old and still decomposing.

NAME: O'CONNELL
And look at this.

NAME: EVELYN
Oh my god, he was buried alive.

NAME: EVELYN
And he left a message.

NAME: EVELYN
It says: 'Death is only the
beginning.'

NAME: O'CONNELL
Where's my gun?

NAME: JONATHAN
What are you going to do? Shoot him?

NAME: O'CONNELL
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
I have heard told of this book, but
I never truly believed it existed.
This, good gentlemen, is a most
priceless treasure.

NAME: HENDERSON
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass
spittoon!

NAME: DANIELS
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta
pure gold!

NAME: JONATHAN
What is this stuff? It smells like
our late friend, the Warden.

NAME: JONATHAN
You did not!?... We're not!?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and
taste worse, but that's the best the
desert has to offer.

NAME: HENDERSON
Say O'Connell, whadaya think these
honey's'll fetch back home?

NAME: BURNS
We hear you gentlemen found yerselves
a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

NAME: DANIELS
Ya know if ya dry him out, you can
sell him for firewood.

NAME: EVELYN
Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them
inside our friend's coffin. They can
stay alive for years living off the
flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

NAME: EVELYN
Famished.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Are you saying somebody threw these
things in with our guy, and they
slowly ate him alive?

NAME: EVELYN
Very slowly.

NAME: JONATHAN
He certainly was not a popular fellow
when they planted him.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Must of got a little too frisky with
the Pharaoh's daughter.

NAME: EVELYN
According to my readings, our friend
suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of
all ancient Egyptian curses, one
reserved for only the most evil
blasphemers. In all of my research,
I've never read of this curse actually
having been performed.

NAME: O'CONNELL
That bad huh?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes, they never used it because they
feared it so. It's written, that if
a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever
arise, he would bring with him the
ten plagues of Egypt.

NAME: O'CONNELL
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten
plagues.

NAME: BENI
Like what that Moses guy did to that
Pharaoh guy?

NAME: EVELYN
That's one way of putting it.

NAME: JONATHAN
Let's see, there was frogs, flies,
locusts...

NAME: BURNS
Hail and fire.

NAME: HENDERSON
The sun turning black.

NAME: DANIELS
Water turning to blood.

NAME: JONATHAN
And my personal favorite: people
covered in boils and sores.

NAME: EVELYN
Fried gizzard anyone?

NAME: O'CONNELL
You sure you outta be playin, around
with that?

NAME: EVELYN
It's just a book, no harm ever came
from a book.

NAME: EVELYN
Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

NAME: EGYPTOLOGIST
What have we done?

NAME: JONATHAN
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!
Billions of grasshoppers!

NAME: O'CONNELL
That's one of the plagues, right?
The grasshopper plague!

NAME: EVELYN
This is not a plague. It's
generational. Every so many years
the locusts of Egypt have a population
explosion and they all take flight.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Okay,... and what about frogs?

NAME: BURNS
Daniels! Henderson!

NAME: BURNS
Daniels?... is that you?

NAME: BURNS
Henderson?

NAME: EVELYN
Oh thank goodness, you're one of the
Americans, aren't you?

NAME: IMHOTEP
Anck-su-namun?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Damn-it! Must be a trap door around
here or somethin'.

NAME: EVELYN
Help me,... please,... help me.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Would you quit playin, around! Let's
get outta here already!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Ahhhhhhhh!!

NAME: ARDETH RAY
I told you to leave or die, you
refused, and now you may have killed
us all. For you have unleashed the
creature that we have feared for
more than four thousand years.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Relax, I got him.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
No mortal weapons can kill this
creature. He is not of this world.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Are we talkin, about the same
creature? The walking corpse? Really
big mouth? Really bad breath?

NAME: BENI
May the good Lord protect and watch
over me as a shepherd watches over
his flock. And may Satan in all his
forms be vanquished forever.

NAME: IMHOTEP
The language of the slaves.

NAME: IMHOTEP
I may have use for you. And the
rewards will be great.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Where are the other sacred jars?

NAME: DANIELS
You bastards!

NAME: HENDERSON
What did you do to him!?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
We saved him! Saved him before the
creature could finish his work. Now
leave, all of you, quickly, before
he finishes you all.

NAME: JONATHAN
You're not going to kill us?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
We must now hunt him down, and try
and find a way to kill him, before
he consumes the earth. Allah be with
us.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I told ya, I already got him!

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Know this, the creature will be coming
for you. He must consummate the curse.
And until he does, he will never
eat, he will never sleep, and he
will never stop.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I thought you didn't believe in this
stuff!?

NAME: EVELYN
Having an encounter with a four
thousand year old walking-talking
corpse tends to convert one.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Forget it, we're out the door down
the hall and gone.

NAME: EVELYN
No, we are not.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Oh yes we are.

NAME: EVELYN
No we are not. We woke him up, and
we must try and stop him.

NAME: O'CONNELL
We?! What we?! You didn't read that
book. I told you not to play around
with that thing.

NAME: EVELYN
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the
book, I woke him up and I intend to
stop him.

NAME: O'CONNELL
How!? You heard the man, no mortal
weapons can kill this guy.

NAME: EVELYN
Then we'll have to find some immortal
ones.

NAME: O'CONNELL
There goes that belief again. Not
me, I am outta here!

NAME: EVELYN
According to that Book, once this
creature has been reborn, his curse
will spread, and as he grows in
strength, so will his curse grow,
infecting the people until the whole
of the earth is destroyed.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

NAME: EVELYN
It's everybody's problem!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Look lady, I appreciate you saving
my life and all, but when I signed
on, I agreed to take you out there
and bring you back, and I did, now
were even, end of job, end of story,
contract terminated.

NAME: EVELYN
That's what I am to you? A contract?

NAME: O'CONNELL
You can either tag along with me, or
you can stay here and play around
with Mister Maggot.

NAME: EVELYN
I'm staying.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did
you slink off to?

NAME: BENI
You left me! You left me in the desert
to rot.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
So who's this guy?

NAME: BENI
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest
of Osiris.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

NAME: BENI
The Prince does not like to be touched
by other humans. A Silly eastern
superstition, I'm afraid.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Yeah, well, we all got our little
problems today don't we?

NAME: BENI
He has come to help Mister Burns.
Somehow I feel responsible.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Don't gimme that, you never had any
scruples.

NAME: BENI
Do you know where I can steal some?

NAME: O'CONNELL
See ya around, Padre.

NAME: WINSTON
I'm the last of the Royal Force still
stationed here, you know? All the
other laddies died in the air and
were buried in the sand.

NAME: WINSTON
Ever since the end of the Great War,
there hasn't been a single challenge
worthy of a man like me.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I've heard it before, Winston.

NAME: WINSTON
I just wish I would've chucked it
with the other laddies, gone down in
a flame of glory, instead of sitting
around here, rotting from boredom
and booze!

NAME: BURNS
The drawer there, spectacles.
As you see, I won't be needing them.

NAME: BENI
Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks
you for your spectacles, -- and for
your eyes,... and for your tongue.

NAME: BENI
But I am afraid more is needed, the
Prince says he must finish the job,
consummate the curse which you and
your friends have brought down upon
yourselves.

NAME: HENDERSON
Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,...
like...

NAME: O'CONNELL
Blood.

NAME: JONATHAN
"And the rivers and waters of Egypt
went red and were as blood."

NAME: O'CONNELL
He's here.

NAME: JONATHAN
Who's here!?

NAME: O'CONNELL
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

NAME: O'CONNELL
We got problems.

NAME: O'CONNELL
He's here! I saw him! That thing is
here!

NAME: EVELYN
The creature!? Are you sure!?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Pretty sure!

NAME: O'CONNELL
We are in serious trouble.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Back off, creep.

NAME: IMHOTEP
You saved me from the undead. For
this, I shall make you immortal.

NAME: HENDERSON
The curse. The curse.

NAME: EVELYN
There's only one person I know who
can possibly give us some answers.

NAME: CURATOR
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

NAME: EVELYN
What is he doing here?

NAME: CURATOR
Do you truly wish to know? Or would
you prefer to just shoot us?

NAME: O'CONNELL
I just saw my fist vanish into some
guy's head.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I'm willin, to go on a little faith,
here.

NAME: CURATOR
You will not believe it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Try me.

NAME: CURATOR
We are part of an ancient secret
society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and
we have a sacred mission, passed
down through thirty-nine generations.
For over four thousand years we have
guarded The City Of The Dead. we are
sworn at manhood to do any and all
in our power to stop the High Priest
Imhotep from being reborn into this
world.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
And because of you, we have failed.

NAME: EVELYN
And you think this justifies killing
innocent people!?

NAME: CURATOR
To have stopped this creature? Yes!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's
afraid of cats, what's that about?

NAME: CURATOR
According to the ancients, cat's are
the guardians at the gates of the
underworld. Imhotep will fear them
until he is fully regenerated, and
then he will fear nothing.

NAME: DANIELS
Right! And ya know how he gets fully
regenerated?! By killing everybody
who opened that chest and sucking us
dry! That's how!

NAME: CURATOR
Yes, the creature must first try and
regenerate, and then he will attempt
to resurrect the one he has loved
for more than four thousand years.

NAME: EVELYN
Anck-su-namun.

NAME: EVELYN
In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
su-namun. And then in Mister Burns'
quarters he tried to kiss me.

NAME: CURATOR
It is because it was you who read
from the Book. He has chosen you to
be the human sacrifice needed to
regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

NAME: JONATHAN
This is not good. Not good at all.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Tonight is the full moon. The moon
of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

NAME: JONATHAN
"...and he stretched forth his hands
towards the heavens, and there was
darkness throughout the land of
Egypt."

NAME: EVELYN
We must stop him from regenerating.

NAME: EVELYN
Who opened that chest?

NAME: HENDERSON
Well, there was me and Daniels here
and then poor Burns of course, oh
yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

NAME: O'CONNELL
What about my buddy, Beni?

NAME: DANIELS
Naw, he scrammed outta there,

NAME: EVELYN
We must find the Egyptologist and
bring him back here to the safety of
the fort, before the creature can
get to him.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you
two come with me.

NAME: HENDERSON
The hell with that! I'm not goin'
nowhere! We're safe here.

NAME: DANIELS
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for
nothin'.

NAME: EVELYN
Who put you in charge? You can't
just leave me behind like some old
suitcase. I'm the one responsible
for this mess and I intend to be the
one to clean it up.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Keep an eye on her. If you leave her
door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon,
Jonathan.

NAME: JONATHAN
Me?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Where's your new friend?

NAME: BENI
What friend? You're my only friend.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Then you got no excuse for living.
What the hell you doin, being buddies
with this creep, Beni? What's in it
for you?

NAME: BENI
It is better to be the right hand of
the Devil,... than in his path. As
long as I serve him, I am immune.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Immune from what?

NAME: BENI
You shall see.

NAME: O'CONNELL
What are you looking for? Lie, and
I'll slit your throat.

NAME: BENI
The book! The black book they found
at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back.
Said to me it would be worth it's
weight in diamonds.

NAME: O'CONNELL
What does he want the book for?

NAME: BENI
Something about bringing his dead
girly-friend back to life. He needs
the book...
And your sister.

NAME: JONATHAN
That looked rather painful.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Ya know, ever since I met you, my
luck has been for crap.

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes, I know, I do that to people.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Damn-it! That's two down and only
two to go.

NAME: JONATHAN
And then he'll be coming after Evy.

NAME: SOLDIER
Ten o'clock! All is well!

NAME: DANIELS
The hell with this. I'm goin,
downstairs to get me a drink. You
want somethin'?

NAME: HENDERSON
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a
shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Get your hands off my girl, pal.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Nice lips.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I figured you might be here, so I
brought a friend.

NAME: EVELYN
You called me your girl?

NAME: O'CONNELL
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um,
you know, figure a speech.

NAME: EVELYN
I think you were jealous

NAME: O'CONNELL
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see
that guy's face?

NAME: DANIELS
Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do
somethin'! we gotta do somethin,
NOW! Before it's too late!

NAME: EVELYN
Last month I came across an
inscription that mentioned The Book
Of The Dead.

NAME: DANIELS
That book we found at Hamunaptra?

NAME: EVELYN
Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked
about bringing people back from the
dead. A notion I was unwilling to
believe.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Believe it, sister. That's what
brought our buddy back to life.

NAME: JONATHAN
And now he's going to use it to bring
his girlfriend back

NAME: ARDETH RAY
And if he succeeds, the two of them
together will bring about the
apocalypse.

NAME: THE CURATOR
The plagues we have seen so far, are
merely Imhotep flexing his muscles.
Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's
resurrection will he be truly
invincible.

NAME: EVELYN
I'm thinking that if the black Book
Of The Dead can bring people back to
life --

NAME: CURATOR
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of
The Living can return them to the
underworld.

NAME: EVELYN
Exactly --

NAME: O'CONNELL
So your sayin', if we find the book
made outta gold --

NAME: CURATOR
-- And read the sacred incantations
contained inside it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You think it'll send this guy back
to hell?

NAME: CURATOR
Correct, And that's when --

NAME: ARDETH RAY
It has begun. The beginning of the
end.

NAME: EVELYN
Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

NAME: EVELYN
Got it!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Got what?

NAME: EVELYN
Since the black Book of The Dead was
found inside the statue of Anubis,
then according to this, the golden
Book of The Living should be inside...

NAME: O'CONNELL
What?

NAME: JONATHAN
What?

NAME: EVELYN
The golden Book Of The Living, is
inside the statue of Horus.

NAME: CURATOR
Which would be located not far to
the east of the Anubis statue.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Don't tell me we gotta go back out
there?

NAME: CURATOR
If we want to kill the creature,
yes.

NAME: JONATHAN
Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

NAME: BENI
Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

NAME: O'CONNELL
You're gonna get yours, pal!

NAME: O'CONNELL
C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

NAME: EVELYN
He's gorgeous.

NAME: THE CURATOR
He has consummated the curse, now
all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun
from the dead, then it will be the
end of us, and the beginning for
them.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Koontash dai na.

NAME: BENI
Take his hand and he will spare the
others.

NAME: EVELYN
Any bright ideas?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Sorry, fresh out.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Don't do it, Evelyn.

NAME: EVELYN
I have no choice.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

NAME: BENI
Come with me my princess. It is time
to make you mine, forever.

NAME: EVELYN
All eternity, idiot.

NAME: EVELYN
You better think of something, because
if he turns me into a mummy, you're
the first one I'm coming after.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Got guts, lady.

NAME: EVELYN
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep
them.

NAME: JONATHAN
Hey that's mine -- !

NAME: O'CONNELL
Evelyn!

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Be calm. There is still time. We can
stop him yet.

NAME: IMHOTEP
Pared oos.

NAME: BENI
Kill them.

NAME: CURATOR
Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

NAME: O'CONNELL
We gotta get her back.

NAME: JONATHAN
I'm with you, old man. No one touches
my sister like that and gets away
with it.

NAME: O'CONNELL
You know where he's taking her?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the
ritual.

NAME: JONATHAN
And what ritual would that be?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
su-namun back to life.

NAME: JONATHAN
And how does one do that?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
By reading the Book Of The Dead.

NAME: JONATHAN
Oh yes, of course.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
And then killing your sister.

NAME: JONATHAN
Excuse me?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Imhotep is now able to cross the
desert with great haste.

NAME: JONATHAN
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't
quite clear on that last part.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
If he arrives before us, it will be
too late.

NAME: JONATHAN
Did you say 'kill' my sister?

NAME: O'CONNELL
I know how to beat him to it.

NAME: WINSTON
So what's your little problem got to
do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

NAME: O'CONNELL
Not a god-damned thing.

NAME: WINSTON
Is it dangerous?

NAME: O'CONNELL
You probably won't live through it.

NAME: WINSTON
By Jove, do you really think so?

NAME: JONATHAN
Everybody else we've bumped into has
died, why not you?

NAME: WINSTON
So what's the challenge then?

NAME: O'CONNELL
To save the damsel in distress, kill
the bad guy and steal his treasure.

NAME: WINSTON
Winston Havlock at your service,
sir!

NAME: EVELYN
What just happened?

NAME: BENI
All I remember is him turning into a
blast of sand,... and then I remember
nothing.

NAME: WINSTON
Hang on, men!

NAME: WINSTON
We're going down!

NAME: WINSTON
Here I come, laddies!

NAME: EVELYN
Stop it! You'll kill them!

NAME: JONATHAN
Excuse me... A little help would be
useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH

NAME: O'CONNELL
Okay, now what the hell does this
Horus guy look like?

NAME: JONATHAN
He's a big fellow with pointy ears
and a face like a falcon.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Got it.

NAME: BENI
Keep moving.

NAME: EVELYN
You know, nasty little fellows such
as yourself, always get their
comeuppance.

NAME: BENI
Yeah?

NAME: EVELYN
Oh yes, always.

NAME: JONATHAN
I say, look at that.

NAME: JONATHAN
Say, gents! You should come have a
look at this.

NAME: O'CONNELL
From now on, don't touch anything.
Not a damn thing. Keep your hands
off the furniture, got it?

NAME: BENI
Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

NAME: EVELYN
Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but
that it's already taken.

NAME: BENI
He wants your heart and your brain,
your liver, your kidneys...

NAME: BENI
...and how do you say? Those slimy
things, in your stomach?

NAME: EVELYN
Intestines.

NAME: BENI
Yeah! Them.

NAME: EVELYN
You only want me for my organs?!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Who the hell are these guys?

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Priests. Imhotep's priests.

NAME: O'CONNELL
I never killed a priest before.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
They are evil, cursed, they matter
not.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Well, okay then.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Oh come on, gimme a break here.

NAME: IMHOTEP
(ancient Egyptian --
subtitled)
Kill them! Kill them all! And bring
me the Book Of The Living!

NAME: ARDETH RAY
My turn.

NAME: O'CONNELL
This whole place is comin, alive!

NAME: ARDETH RAY
I'm out.

NAME: JONATHAN
There he is!

NAME: JONATHAN
Hello Horus old boy.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Allow me.

NAME: O'CONNELL
These guys just don't quit.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Keep digging!

NAME: AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL
THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in
the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

NAME: ARDETH RAY
Save the girl! Kill the creature!

NAME: O'CONNELL
That's the last one, we better get
lucky.

NAME: IMHOTEP
With your death, my love and I will
be invincible!

NAME: JONATHAN
I found it, Evy! I found it

NAME: EVELYN
Shut-up and get me off of here!

NAME: EVELYN
Open the book, Jonathan! Open the
book! That's the only way to kill
him!

NAME: JONATHAN
I can't open it! It's locked or
something!

NAME: JONATHAN
We need the key!

NAME: JONATHAN
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

NAME: EVELYN
Read the inscription on the cover!

NAME: JONATHAN
Keetash-something, naraba-something.

NAME: JONATHAN
Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

NAME: JONATHAN
Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

NAME: JONATHAN
Oh boy.

NAME: O'CONNELL
This just keeps gettin, better and
better.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

NAME: JONATHAN
You have got to be joking?

NAME: EVELYN
Finish the inscription, idiot!

NAME: JONATHAN
Oh.

NAME: JONATHAN
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now
what is this last symbol here?

NAME: EVELYN
What's it look like!?

NAME: JONATHAN
It's an Anck symbol, with two little
squiggly lines above it, and a bird,
a stork! on either side.

NAME: EVELYN
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

NAME: JONATHAN
Yes,... I see.

NAME: JONATHAN
Hootash im Ahmenophus!

NAME: O'CONNELL
Okay pal, let's see how tough you
are without your right arm.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Alright,... so he's left handed.

NAME: JONATHAN
I got it!

NAME: EVELYN
Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos!

NAME: EVELYN
Death is only the beginning.

NAME: O'CONNELL
C'mon!

NAME: BENI
Go away.

NAME: JONATHAN
Well,... I guess we go home empty
handed.

NAME: O'CONNELL
Wouldn't say that.

NAME: CHRIS
There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
comedians.

NAME: KUMAIL
You complain about the crowd like all
the time.

NAME: CHRIS
Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.

NAME: KUMAIL
So like ninety percent of the time,
they're really bad?

NAME: CHRIS
Will you just watch and give me notes
tonight? If we both give each other
notes, I think it would be helpful.

NAME: KUMAIL
Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
into the bit.

NAME: CHRIS
Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
it's hard on the end.

NAME: MARY
That was truly horrible.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey, that was great.

NAME: MARY
No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
thought I was gonna puke.

NAME: CHRIS
Who?

NAME: MARY
Bob Dalavan.

NAME: CHRIS
Who's Bob Dalaban?

NAME: CJ
Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.

NAME: DODD
No one's on stage?

NAME: MARY
No!

NAME: KUMAIL
He might have been doing cocaine.

NAME: CJ
Was he doing cocaine recreationally?

NAME: MARY
A true cokehead.

NAME: CHRIS
Confidence. Poise. Smile.

NAME: KUMAIL
He's like if a serial killer fucked an
inspirational speaker.

NAME: CJ
He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
sucks.

NAME: CHRIS
Just bought a laser printer. Printed
out like six lasers so far.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
tonight. Could I do ten?

NAME: DODD
No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
you get five minutes. You know the
deal.

NAME: KUMAIL
C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.

NAME: DODD
No.

NAME: KUMAIL
What are you gonna do in there?

NAME: DODD
I'm making up next week's schedule.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay. Cool.

NAME: CJ
I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
trying to mansplain to her that, you
know, we are on one little rock orbiting
a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
You are cosmically over reacting to this.
Honestly you are being super selfish.
You're right, but you're selfish.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
reports so I looked up what cheese is and
cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
the heroin, it's very powerful. You
already have heroin.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Is Pakistan in the house?!

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
You're not from Pakistan. I would have
noticed you.

NAME: CHRIS
He just gave you Montreal? Like you
don't have to showcase or audition or
anything?

NAME: CJ
It was too easy. Like I wanted to
struggle. I wanted a story to be able
to tell on talk shows and instead,
like, you guys don't know how hard it
is not to struggle. It's a struggle
succeeding effortlessly.

NAME: MARY
Did he say anything about me?

NAME: CJ
Sure.

NAME: CHRIS
What about me?

NAME: CJ
Both of you. He said, those guys
performed...

NAME: MARY
I truly hate you, actually.

NAME: CHRIS
We all hate you.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hi.

NAME: EMILY
Hi.

NAME: KUMAIL
Um, my name is Kumail.

NAME: EMILY
Yeah. We know.

NAME: JESSIE
We saw you perform.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
the way, I have to tell you that when
you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
so rude.

NAME: EMILY
I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
you. It was supportive.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay, that's a common misconception.
Yelling anything at a comedian is
considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
have to be negative.

NAME: EMILY
So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
bed," that would be a heckle?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

NAME: JESSIE
Wow. Goodbye!

NAME: EMILY
Don't go! You scared my friend off now.

NAME: KUMAIL
What's your name?

NAME: EMILY
Emily.

NAME: KUMAIL
I want to show you something, Emily.
This is your name in Urdu.

NAME: EMILY
Whoa. Does this move work?

NAME: KUMAIL
I've had some minor success with it.

NAME: EMILY
Bullshit.

NAME: KUMAIL
So you came to a comedy show with your
friends?

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, we're all grad students at U of

NAME: KUMAIL
What are you studying at grad school?

NAME: EMILY
I study psychology. I'm going to be a
therapist.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
ask people, "how did that make you
feel?"

NAME: EMILY
Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
work with a group of guys convicted of
domestic violence.

NAME: KUMAIL
Jesus.

NAME: EMILY
Cheers to that.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
you becoming a therapist.

NAME: EMILY
Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
start there and then we'll go to the
rest of it.

NAME: KUMAIL
So my roommate Chris is probably on the
couch. He's going to try and start a
conversation. So no matter what- do not
engage. Okay? Let's go.

NAME: CHRIS
Hi!

NAME: CHRIS (CONT'D)
Good for him.

NAME: KUMAIL
Do you want to watch a movie?

NAME: EMILY
Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
Or...

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
what, go for that area. I cleaned that
earlier this year.

NAME: EMILY
Should I take my shoes off or is this a
shoes on bed?

NAME: KUMAIL
No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
rules.

NAME: EMILY
Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
mattress.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
inflatable mattress?

NAME: EMILY
I did think it might be an actual
mattress.

NAME: KUMAIL
Well air mattresses are actual
mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
air based comfort items.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Night of The Living Dead?

NAME: EMILY
Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
And the good guys, um...

NAME: CHRIS
Text Lauren. You up girl?

NAME: SIRI
What do you want to say to Warren?

NAME: CHRIS
Ah, no. Fuck.

NAME: SIRI
What do you want to say to-

NAME: CHRIS
You up? Period. Send.

NAME: SIRI
That may be beyond my abilities at the
moment.

NAME: CHRIS
Fuck.

NAME: EMILY
What are these scars?

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.

NAME: EMILY
I thought only old people had those.

NAME: KUMAIL
Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
fighting some battles you guys have
already won.

NAME: EMILY
What were you like in high school? Were
you like, super funny? Were you really
smart?

NAME: KUMAIL
I was very shy. They called me
chashmullee.

NAME: EMILY
What is that?

NAME: KUMAIL
It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
show you a picture.

NAME: EMILY
Of you in high school? Oh my god!

NAME: KUMAIL
Boom.

NAME: EMILY
No.

NAME: KUMAIL
And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
now.

NAME: EMILY
What inspired this hair cut?

NAME: KUMAIL
Hugh Grant.

NAME: EMILY
Oh no. And you're so serious.

NAME: KUMAIL
I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
he said he doesn't smile because it
makes his face look fat. So I didn't
smile in pictures for many years. What
were you like in high school? Were you
voted... Most Sexy?

NAME: EMILY
No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."

NAME: KUMAIL
That's good.

NAME: EMILY
No. It's really not good. I had acne,
and I was a Goth and I had this
terrible perm. The kids called me
Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
I do know why, it's because they
thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
think I'm done with this subject. In
fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

NAME: KUMAIL
Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.

NAME: EMILY
No. No. I'm really not that kind of
girl. I only have sex once on a first
date. Plus a hand job.

NAME: KUMAIL
Well I haven't had that yet!

NAME: EMILY
You don't get that because you made fun
of me.

NAME: KUMAIL
What is happening right now? What are you
doing?

NAME: EMILY
I'm changing under this blanket.

NAME: KUMAIL
I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
were just having sex?

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, but you were in the throes of
passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
call an Uber and go home.

NAME: KUMAIL
Your driver will be ready as soon as he
puts on his pants.

NAME: EMILY
Were you available for rides while we
were fucking?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
times.

NAME: KUMAIL
So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
sometime and we can grab a drink?

NAME: EMILY
I'm not really - I know this sounds
like a line - but I'm not really dating
right now. I have a lot of school and
work and just a lot on my plate.

NAME: KUMAIL
That's perfect because I'm not really
dating right now either. I actually
have a pretty strict two-day rule where
I can't see someone more than two days
in a row. So since we hung out for two
days, if I were to see you again, which
I won't because you're not dating, I'm
not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
you until Monday.

NAME: EMILY
We haven't hung out for two days. We've
hung out for about five hours. Just to
like, be totally clear.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
days.

NAME: EMILY
You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
really takes you off the table.

NAME: KUMAIL
That works out, because I am a hard
core time nerd.

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, I can tell.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
stuff.

NAME: EMILY
So wait, just to establish, what did we
just decide?

NAME: KUMAIL
We decided we aren't ever going to see
each other again.

NAME: EMILY
Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't want to touch your jeans.

NAME: AZMAT
They're like sweatpants. You should be
stylish like your father. It's not very
difficult. Just observe me.

NAME: NAVEED
Get some Daddy Style.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
like Naveed's, just a small one.

NAME: AZMAT
Maybe like mine, small and stylish.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
you don't enroll for LSAT now?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
I like that you bring it up as though
you've never brought it up before.

NAME: NAVEED
How's the stand-up coming Bhai?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's going fine.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Since when are you someone to stand-up?
You know who I think should stand up is
Malala. She has something to say.

NAME: NAVEED
Ma-la-la.

NAME: KUMAIL
She does open mics and she crushes. Lot
of ethnic material, which I think is a
crutch, and that one story gets a lot of
play, but -

NAME: FATIMA
You should be on that show Saturday Night
Live!

NAME: KUMAIL
That's a great idea. I should e-mail
them, I don't know why I hadn't thought
of that.

NAME: AZMAT
You know, I hacked into your Cousin
Rehan's Facebook account-

NAME: KUMAIL
You hacked into it?

NAME: AZMAT
Yeah, they were not accepting my friend
request so I had to hack into it and I
discovered he and that white woman he is
living with are having a baby -

NAME: KUMAIL
They're married.

NAME: AZMAT
Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into
Tumblr and I discovered that they named
him Dav. Can you imagine?

NAME: KUMAIL
Dave. It's probably Dave.

NAME: ALL
Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Very, very, very sad. No one is going to
visit that baby. That baby, mark my
words, will grow up without a family.

NAME: FATIMA
It's like he's dead. Or worse.

NAME: SHARMEEN
It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we
can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is
downstairs.

NAME: NAVEED
Hurry up yaar. Ice cream.

NAME: AZMAT
My mother used to make best kulfi. Your
grandmother.

NAME: KUMAIL
I think ice cream is better than kulfi.

NAME: AZMAT
No, no-

NAME: SHARMEEN
Oh. I wonder who that could be?

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm guessing it's a young, single
Pakistani woman who just happened to be
driving by our house, which is in a cul-
de-sac and I'm also guessing that the
phrase "dropped in" will be said in the
next ten seconds.

NAME: AZMAT/NAVEED/FATIMA
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven -

NAME: SHARMEEN
Everyone. This is Zubeida. She just
dropped in.

NAME: ZUBEIDA
Salaam.

NAME: ALL
Wa alaikum salaam.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Please, sit.

NAME: ZUBEIDA
Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X-
Files. Because that's your favorite
show, huh?

NAME: KUMAIL
Thank you so much.

NAME: ZUBEIDA
The truth is out there!

NAME: KUMAIL
It's from the show. Thank you.

NAME: SHARMEEN
I hope you come back.

NAME: SHARMEEN (CONT'D)
Kumi, there's not going to be a magic
spark, okay? You have to work at it. You
have to stay open.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were
better at it, you know?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I mean you've had so much practice and
you're still not that good at it!

NAME: SHARMEEN
Ha. Ha. Ha.

NAME: KUMAIL
You brought your A-game with Naveed, but
then with me, you're kind of just phoning
it in a little bit.

NAME: SHARMEN
Again with the comedy, the comedy. All
the time with the comedy. Be serious!

NAME: KUMAIL
I am serious! That's why I want to help
you get better!

NAME: EMILY
So, are you ever going to let me sit in
the front seat?

NAME: KUMAIL
No, I'm a professional. And you're paying
for this ride.

NAME: EMILY
I don't want to pay for this ride! It's
surging right now.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in
the number.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a
string of failures. So, it turns to its
most bankable star, Vincent Price.

NAME: EMILY
Is this your compatibility test? Like,
the way people are with Vonnegut or The
Big Lebowski?

NAME: KUMAIL
No! Just watch the movie. And take it
seriously.

NAME: EMILY
I'm going to love it. I love it when men
test me on my taste.

NAME: KUMAIL
I just want to share this movie with you,
so I don't know why you're reading into-

NAME: EMILY
How many women have you shown this movie
to?

NAME: KUMAIL
Zero.

NAME: EMILY
How many women have you shown a B Horror
movie to on like, a third date.

NAME: KUMAIL
This is not a B horror movie.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes
cause when the menu comes up, there's
some spoilers in the menu.

NAME: EMILY
I'm ready, I'm ready!

NAME: KUMAIL
Ok, I'll hit play.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Watch!

NAME: EMILY
I'm watching!

NAME: KUMAIL
Shhhhhh! Watch this part.

NAME: EMILY
Stop watching me!

NAME: KUMAIL
No! Are you tired? We can watch it later.

NAME: EMILY
I just have that weird yawning thing that
happens, when you're watching a really
boring film.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in.
The plot kicks in really soon.

NAME: EMILY
That was fun. Thanks for the ride home,
but we gotta stop doing this.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah.

NAME: EMILY
I know I've said that before, but I
really do mean it. I can't be doing this
right now.

NAME: KUMAIL
I know. Totally. One hundred percent. I
agree with you.

NAME: EMILY
So don't call me again.

NAME: KUMAIL
I won't. I promise.

NAME: EMILY
Good luck on all your future endeavors.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an
awkward hug before we part forever?

NAME: EMILY
Ok.

NAME: KUMAIL
Ok.

NAME: EMILY
Goodbye.

NAME: KUMAIL
Goodbye.

NAME: EMILY
You just promised never to call me
again.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's really cold out here. It's so
cold.

NAME: EMILY
You make a pretty good point.

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
It's a lot warmer in here.

NAME: KUMAIL
It is warmer in here.

NAME: EMILY
You know, it's really nice upstairs.

NAME: KUMAIL
Is it?

NAME: CJ
Emily, has Kumail told you that in
addition to being an Uber driver he
also has a one-man show?

NAME: EMILY
No, he did not tell me that.   Do you
really?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's really nothing. It's just
something I'm fiddling around with.

NAME: EMILY
How is a one man show different from
stand-up?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's really not.

NAME: MARY
There's lots of wigs and costume
changes.

NAME: CJ
There's a lot of acting in it.

NAME: MARY
And then like at the end of it, you've
got this very awkward conversation where
you go, "I really liked it."

NAME: KUMAIL
But I thought you really liked it!

NAME: MARY
I really liked it.

NAME: EMILY
I can't wait to see the show.

NAME: KUMAIL
You will never see the show...

NAME: CJ
You have to see the show.

NAME: MARY
You have to see it.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's not ready.

NAME: CJ
You will love the acting.

NAME: KUMAIL
They're fucking with you.   It's not
really like that.

NAME: EMILY
Are they fucking with me or you? It
seems like they're fucking with you.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm twelve years old. This...this is
home. Feels like I never left. Do you
smell that? That's my mom cooking the
Murgh Roghen Joash.

NAME: CJ
Fuck.

NAME: KUMAIL
Do you hear that? That's my father
watching cricket on the telly. Do you
feel that? That's the weight of
Pakistan's history.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Pakistan was formed when it separated
from its biggest rival, India, on
August 14th 1947.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Six runs!

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Silly Mid On, Short Mid Wicket,
Midwicket, Deep Mid Wicket, Mid On, Long
On, Long Off...

NAME: JESSIE
I have to leave as soon as the show's
over. I can't stay.

NAME: KUMAIL
So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you
know you're getting a Yorker soon.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports
are cotton and...

NAME: AUDIENCE
Concrete.

NAME: CJ
Kill me.

NAME: KUMAIL
Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas.
Except instead of the traditional
Christmas ham, we serve Mitthai, which
my khansama Chris will serve to you
right now. Khansama is Urdu for
servant.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
If you'd like to make it at home, the
main ingredients are condensed milk,
sugar, and love. At least, that was my
mom's recipe.

NAME: CJ
Hey, you look like a children's toy from
Malaysia.

NAME: KUMAIL
Now all rise for the Pakistani national
anthem.

NAME: EMILY
Hey!

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey!    So? What did you think?

NAME: EMILY
Um, I thought it was great.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah?

NAME: EMILY
I never knew that Pakistan had the
world's largest irrigation system.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. Something like 14 million
hectares are being irrigated. As soon
as I read that I was like "oh, that's
going in the show."

NAME: CJ
Hey, that was... You were in the zone,
man. That was the best one we've seen.

NAME: MARY
Yeah, that was so honest and good.

NAME: CJ
And you know what I realized halfway
through? You're from Pakistan! Good to
see you Emily!

NAME: EMILY
Bye guys!

NAME: CJ
Keep up the-

NAME: KUMAIL
They seem to like it.

NAME: EMILY
They're so nice.

NAME: KUMAIL
So, really what did you think?   You know,
it's a work in progress...

NAME: EMILY
I really liked it. I learned a lot.
About Pakistan, and cricket. All those
positions. But I just wish that I
learned more about you. Does that make
any sense?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey.

NAME: EMILY
Oh, hi!

NAME: KUMAIL
It's 3 AM.

NAME: EMILY
Is that diner around the corner open?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old
lemon meringue pie?

NAME: EMILY
You're so funny! Actually, no, I
just...I really need to get a cup of
coffee.

NAME: KUMAIL
I can make you coffee.

NAME: EMILY
I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste.

NAME: KUMAIL
All right, I'll come with you.

NAME: EMILY
No, no! Why would you do that?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna
let you go on your own.

NAME: EMILY
Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's
the most misogynist thing I've ever
heard.

NAME: KUMAIL
Why are you being so weird?

NAME: EMILY
Fuck you, I'm not being weird.

NAME: KUMAIL
You're being so weird.

NAME: EMILY
Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're
being so weird!

NAME: KUMAIL
How am I weird? I want to sleep while
it's sleep time.

NAME: EMILY
This is normal. Girls go to get coffee
in the middle of the night. Have you
never had a girlfriend before? This is
what it's like.

NAME: KUMAIL
Are you okay?

NAME: EMILY
Everything is not okay. Everything is
not okay.

NAME: KUMAIL
You can tell me anything, you know that
right? You can tell me anything.

NAME: EMILY
I have to take a shit, okay? I have to
take a huge fucking dookie. I can't
take a poo in your bathroom because you
don't have any matches and you don't
have any air freshener. What kind of
person doesn't have any matches or air
freshener in the bathroom? The walls
are so thin! And Chris is right out
there.

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
Please stop laughing! Please, please.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay, I have an idea.

NAME: KUMAIL
How are you?

NAME: EMILY
I do not want to talk about it.

NAME: NAVEED
Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about
shifting weight and torque.

NAME: NAVEED (CONT'D)
Oh Christ!

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Hey he's pretty good. Just do what
he's doing.

NAME: NAVEED
Mine.

NAME: KUMAIL
Come on.

NAME: NAVEED
Mine, mine.

NAME: KUMAIL
These cookies are really good.

NAME: NAVEED
They're biscuits! Listen to yourself.
You hardly sound Pakistani. "Cookies"?
You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
You're such a burger.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm not a burger.

NAME: NAVEED
Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually
a British term.

NAME: NAVEED
Well thank you for that information
that no one gives a shit about and you
should listen to mom and grow a beard.

NAME: KUMAIL
It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's
all patchy.

NAME: NAVEED
Try being a man and conditioning like I
do.

NAME: KUMAIL
What's the whole thing with Muslims
growing beards anyway? It's such an
arbitrary thing. Like who decided that?
Oh, we have to have beards.

NAME: NAVEED
Yeah. There are a billion of us and you
are the only one with the truth. Is
that right? The sun is just shining
down on you right now. It's just
parting like "ahh".

NAME: KUMAIL
You know, I have to tell you something,
Bhai.

NAME: NAVEED
Here we go. Yeah?

NAME: KUMAIL
I've been dating this girl.

NAME: NAVEED
Acha.

NAME: NAVEED
I thought you were going to say you were
involved in a hit and run or you got
caught forging some checks. But a WHITE
GIRL? Such a cliche.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's okay! We hate terrorists!

NAME: NAVEED
Listen. I understand. You're in
America. You wanna mow a few lawns and
see what it's like. But eventually you
have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I
hung out with other girls. But then I
married Fatima. We hardly spoke two
words to each other the first few
months! But now, Kumi, she's like my
best friend. You have to break up with
her immediately.

NAME: KUMAIL
If I find someone who's as good for me
as Fatima is for you, Mom would
understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't
love me less?

NAME: NAVEED
She would definitely love you less.
Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the
word when guys stop returning girls'
calls?

NAME: KUMAIL
Ghosting?

NAME: NAVEED
Yes.
You have to end it now or Mom will
fucking ghost you.

NAME: NAVEED (CONT'D)
Now come on.

NAME: EMILY
I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd
say it's very fruit forward.

NAME: KUMAIL
Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice
that's gone bad. How do you know so
much about wine?

NAME: EMILY
Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my
first marriage and I drank a lot and
one way to cover drinking is to know a
lot about wine.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm sorry wait, what did you say?

NAME: EMILY
That knowing a lot about wine sort of
covers for drinking a lot.

NAME: KUMAIL
No, the huge piece of information
you're trying to blow right past.

NAME: EMILY
Yeah. I was married.

NAME: KUMAIL
You were married?

NAME: EMILY
I was. I was married. Do you want to
talk about something else?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, cause I don't really have any
questions other than...when did you get
married? When did you get divorced?
What's his name? How tall is he? Did
you love him? I guess I have a couple
of questions.

NAME: EMILY
NAME: IT'S NOT OKAY THIS IS YOUR LIFE". I
Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in
college. Everyone I knew was getting
married super young, so we did. And one
day I was at a restaurant and I saw
this couple making out and I thought "I
don't think about my husband like that,
but I guess that's okay" and then
another part of my brain was like "NO
feel like this is freaking you out.
Does this freak you out?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's not freaking me out.

NAME: EMILY
I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I
know it's only been a few months.

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
But I just wanted to tell you that I am
completely overwhelmed by you. It's the
last thing I was expecting.

NAME: KUMAIL
This is also the last thing I was
expecting and I also feel completely
overwhelmed by you.

NAME: EMILY
That's a weird thing to say.

NAME: KUMAIL
Why? I just said what you said. Exactly
what you said.

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said
it.   It's okay.

NAME: EMILY
So listen, my parents are coming to
town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come
for lunch?

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule,
right? You'll come to Mary's party
Friday night and then you'll probably
spend the night. So I won't be able to
see you until Monday, so...

NAME: EMILY
Okay. Well, I would love to meet your
parents. They live in the city, right?

NAME: KUMAIL
Well, they live in the suburbs. You
know, I don't really see them very
much.

NAME: EMILY
Have they asked about me? What do they
think? Do they want to meet me? My
parents want to meet you.

NAME: KUMAIL
Of course, of course. They're dying to
meet you.

NAME: EMILY
Ow... oh my god..

NAME: KUMAIL
Are you okay? What happened?

NAME: EMILY
Totally fine.

NAME: KUMAIL
Do you need assistance?

NAME: EMILY
I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took
this stupid hip hop dance class last
weekend.

NAME: KUMAIL
You should get it looked at. Do you want
ice?

NAME: EMILY
Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally
fine.

NAME: KUMAIL
Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry
you? I can carry you the rest of the day?

NAME: EMILY
Kumail, seriously, stop.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey, I liked your friends.     That Craig
guy or was it Greg?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I can never tell with those names. I'm
glad I like him cause I don't want to
have to come up with excuses to avoid
him, you know. Like, oh no, I have
kite surfing tonight.

NAME: KUMAIL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
Did you know in the UK it's pronounced
"Crayg". Which is good because that's
actually how it's written, right? He's
a "Crate" guy.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I was going to tell you about that.

NAME: EMILY
Are you like judging Pakistan's Next
Top Model or something? Seriously, who
are these women?

NAME: KUMAIL
You know how we have arranged marriage
in my culture? These are those women.

NAME: EMILY
These are women in Pakistan who want to
marry you?

NAME: KUMAIL
They're not in Pakistan.

NAME: EMILY
You've met these women?

NAME: KUMAIL
Just with my parents. We haven't like -

NAME: EMILY
You're not serious about this, are you?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's my mom's thing, I just go along with
it.

NAME: EMILY
So what does your mom think about you and
me, then?

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
She doesn't know about me, does she?

NAME: KUMAIL
No.

NAME: EMILY
Fucking five months   of red flags. Oh my
god, I'm so stupid.   You ducking my
parents. Oh my god,   the two day rule!
Seriously, red flag   after red flag.
Such a liar!

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
You lie to me. You lie to your parents.
And those are just the people you like!
Is there someone that you're not lying
to? I'd love to meet them, cause then I
could tell them what a fucking liar you
are!

NAME: KUMAIL
You didn't tell me about your being
divorced until recently. You were
hiding fucking something too!

NAME: EMILY
My divorce does not mean our future is
impossible. It actually means the
direct opposite. I'm not hiding
anything from you. Okay? I'm an open
fucking book. You wanna know what's in
my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and
stamps.

NAME: KUMAIL
Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you
supposed to be good at handling these
types of things.

NAME: EMILY
Where are my fucking shoes?

NAME: KUMAIL
Aren't you supposed to be handling this
better than you are right now?

NAME: EMILY
I'm expressing myself!

NAME: KUMAIL
You know what we call "arranged
marriage" in my culture, Emily?
Marriage! Okay? We just call it
marriage. There's another type of
marriage that's called "love marriage"
and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married
an Irish woman and he was kicked out of
the family! And nobody is allowed to
talk to him.

NAME: EMILY
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

NAME: KUMAIL
Because I didn't think you'd fucking
understand and I was fucking right!

NAME: EMILY
You don't think I could fathom your life
in any fucking way?

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm fighting a fourteen hundred year
old culture! You were ugly in high
school! There's a big fucking
difference!
I'm sorry. I can't lose my family.

NAME: EMILY
Can you imagine a world where we end up
together?

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't know.

NAME: EMILY
I have to go. Don't fucking call me.

NAME: YAZMIN
Multi-grain, pumpernickel, pita bread,
hot dog buns, croutons..I can't eat any
of it.

NAME: SAM
I don't want kids. People say, Sam,
you're gonna love it. You're gonna have a
kid and he's gonna be your best friend.
A best friend that pukes on you and shits
everywhere, and is constantly screaming.
I already have friends like that. People
say, Sam...

NAME: CJ
I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a
good person, I'm not saying she's not.
All I'm saying is this is the universe
telling you: seize your moment. Be a
little selfish and pursue your career.
Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on
Thursday. If you book the Montreal
Comedy Festival, it would change things
for you. You don't wanna get stuck in
Chicago, right? You don't wanna be like
Sam Highsmith. He's been doing the
"people say Sam" bit since '03.

NAME: SAM
People say, Sam...

NAME: CJ
Is that what you want?

NAME: KUMAIL
It's amazing. It's the same material.

NAME: SAM
What do people say?

NAME: AUDIENCE
Sam!

NAME: SAM
People say what?

NAME: AUDIENCE
Sam!

NAME: SAM
I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much!

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him
how I actually feel about it.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Great set, dude!

NAME: SAM
Crushing it!

NAME: KUMAIL
Love the new stuff!

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

NAME: CJ
We're weak.

NAME: KHADIJA
I wouldn't really call it an obsession
but... I'm pretty good at magic.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Can you make his belly disappear?

NAME: AZMAT
No, I'm too happy with my belly.

NAME: KHADIJA
Does anyone have a dollar?

NAME: AZMAT
I will give you something.

NAME: KHADIJA
20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't
you think he'd look cool with sunglasses?

NAME: KHADIJA (CONT'D)
We sprinkle the magic dust on.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, you can't do it without the magic
dust.

NAME: KHADIJA
Yeah, I need it. All right...

NAME: KHADIJA (CONT'D)
Ok. Watching carefully -

NAME: FATIMA
That is amazing! And he does look
better with glasses!

NAME: KUMAIL
How did you do that?

NAME: KHADIJA
Oh no, a magician never reveals her
tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr.
Nanjiani.

NAME: AZMAT
Do you think I could use this twenty
dollar bill to buy something?

NAME: KHADIJA
It looks better now, right?

NAME: KUMAIL
I was watching this monster movie with my
friend and he turned to me and was like,
"what would you do in that situation?"
I'm never going to be one of the last
guys alive. I'm going to be the first guy
to die. I die so the other characters get
to find out something weird is going on.
I go off alone to find the cat.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I never even find out that there were
monsters. To me, the plot of the movie
was "we're at a research facility and the
cat's missing." The end.

NAME: KUMAIL
Denise. This is your name in Urdu.

NAME: DENISE
Wow, that is so cool.

NAME: BOB DALAVAN
Kumail? Hey, Bob Dalavan.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, I know you.

NAME: BOB DALAVAN
You had some very interesting premises in
your set tonight.

NAME: KUMAIL
Thanks.

NAME: BOB DALAVAN
I just wanted you to know that you made
the finals for the Montreal Showcase.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh my god. Thank you.

NAME: BOB DALAVAN
You too, Mary. Congrats.

NAME: MARY
Oh, ok!

NAME: BOB DALAVAN
So we'll see you guys up there. We'll
be in touch.

NAME: CHRIS
What about C-Dog?

NAME: BOB DALAVAN
Who's that?

NAME: CHRIS
Um, me. What about me?

NAME: DALAVAN
You know, funny stuff, okay?

NAME: DENISE
Do you wanna go somewhere?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, let's go somewhere.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hello?

NAME: JESSIE
Kumail. It's Jessie.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey.     Who?

NAME: JESSIE
Jessie. I'm in school with Emily.
Listen, Emily is in the hospital.

NAME: KUMAIL
What?

NAME: KUMAIL
Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um,
Emily Gardner? She was checked in...

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey.

NAME: EMILY
What are you doing here?

NAME: KUMAIL
Jessie called me and wanted me to make
sure you were okay. So how are you
doing?

NAME: EMILY
Fine. Totally fine. Never been better.
A thousand percent fine. Just like
fainted a little at work. I didn't have
breakfast this morning.

NAME: KUMAIL
Breakfast is the most important meal of
the day. You know that.

NAME: NURSE BETTE
Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready
soon. Okay?

NAME: EMILY
Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home
and sleep in my own bed.

NAME: NURSE BETTE
Sir, can you step outside a moment,
please? If you want to stay you have to
go to the security desk to get a pass.

NAME: KUMAIL
Where is the security desk?

NAME: NURSE BETTE
It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked
in. At the security desk.

NAME: KUMAIL
The security desk is at the security
desk. Got it.

NAME: KUMAIL
Can I get you something? Water. Juice.
Coffee?

NAME: DR. WRIGHT
May I speak with you for a second?

NAME: KUMAIL
I'll be right back.

NAME: DR. WRIGHT
There is a massive infection in her
lungs. All her vitals are elevated.
Does she have HIV?

NAME: KUMAIL
What? No. I mean she--

NAME: DR. WRIGHT
Are you her husband?

NAME: KUMAIL
No--

NAME: DR. WRIGHT
We need to intubate her immediately. I
need a family member to sign this. So
I'm going to ask you again. Are you her
husband?

NAME: KUMAIL
What does "intubate" mean?

NAME: DR. WRIGHT
We have to put her on a respirator and
to do that we need to put her in a
medically induced coma.

NAME: KUMAIL
Coma.

NAME: DR. WRIGHT
Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on
the infection. And it needs to happen
right now. So, I'm going to ask you one
last time, are you her husband?

NAME: EMILY
What's going on?! Where are you taking
me?

NAME: NURSE JUDY
You should call her family.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm sorry.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail,
Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be
calling you so late. Emily's fine.
Just want to get that taken care of.
She's fine. She is at City View
Hospital in Chicago in a medically
induced coma. But the doctors say that-
- Yes I did say coma.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey. I'm Kumail.

NAME: BETH
We know who you are Kumail.

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would
like to see you now.

NAME: BETH
Be right back.

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Listen, the doctor will be here any
minute. She's just running a little
late. Don't read anything into this
being in the bereavement room. It was
the only room we had available.

NAME: TERRY
Okay. Thank you.

NAME: BETH
Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane.

NAME: TERRY
I know, I know. But it makes me feel
better.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
Hello.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM (CONT'D)
Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's
attending. I'll be coordinating all the
doctors and orchestrating her treatment
strategy.

NAME: BETH
"All the doctors"? How many are there?

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
Five.

NAME: BETH
Five? Why so many? Is that normal?

NAME: DR. LEWIN
We immediately initiated orotracheal
intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected
her heart at this point.

NAME: DR. WHELAN
We don't know the exact nature of the
infection yet, but we've got her on a
broad spectrum of antibiotics.

NAME: DR. PLATT
...critical infections centering around
the costodiaphragmatic--

NAME: DR. SPELLMAN
Our theory is methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus.

NAME: TERRY
Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an "f"
or a "ph"?

NAME: DR. SPELLMAN
Ph.

NAME: KUMAIL
That was very reassuring, wasn't it?
Apparently, there are good and bad
comas. And the kind that they put her
in, the medically induced ones, are
definitely the good kind of coma.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Like you know how there are good and
bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good
or bad.

NAME: TERRY
Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle
things from here. You've been very
helpful. Thank you. For signing the
thing-

NAME: KUMAIL
My pleasure

NAME: TERRY
But you can go now.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the
Mideast.

NAME: CHRIS
What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
the airport get a boner. Does that mean
drugs or bombs?

NAME: CJ
That's good. What if instead of it being
at the airport, you quit comedy and never
did comedy ever again?

NAME: CHRIS
Fuck you. It's a good bit.

NAME: CJ
Just for the sake of the public. So they
wouldn't have to look at your face or
hear your words.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's okay that I'm not there, right?
Like, I don't need to be there, right?

NAME: SAM
What happened?

NAME: CHRIS
He put his girlfriend in a coma. You
know, the way you do.

NAME: MARY
He signed a paper that allowed doctors to
put her--

NAME: CJ
He suggested it.

NAME: KUMAIL
She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
know medical stuff. That's what doctors
do. They're good at medical stuff. This
is a medically induced coma. This is
their specialty.

NAME: MARY
Maybe.

NAME: CHRIS
It might be a good thing. She might wake
up with a new skill. Like my cousin
blacked out once and when he came to, he
thought he knew a different language.

NAME: CJ
Did he?

NAME: CHRIS
No, it was just gibberish that he made
up. It was brain damage.

NAME: SAM
I got another Taco Bell one...

NAME: BETH
Did you forget something?

NAME: KUMAIL
Is she up yet?

NAME: TERRY
No, she's not. They won't tell us
anything. We've been here all morning.

NAME: KUMAIL
I know you guys said you don't need me
to stay, but I think I'm just going to
wait anyway.

NAME: BETH
You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
you're here. You don't have to worry
about being committed to anything,
Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
awake. There's no need to do it when
she's unconscious.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's more complicated than that--

NAME: BETH
Is it? Because I know about the two-day
rule, I know about the headshots and the
secrets. She tells us everything.
You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
have already done a lot.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
seat- ?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Is that lady still looking at me?

NAME: TERRY
No reason you should eat there by
yourself. Right, hon?

NAME: BETH
It's a free country.

NAME: KUMAIL
How's your sandwich?

NAME: BETH
Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.

NAME: TERRY
Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
You know, we're not by the water. Well,
we are by the water, but it's a lake.
There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
guess. Whatever the good dice number
is.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
So, uh, 9/11?

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a
conversation about it with...people.

NAME: KUMAIL
You've never talked to people about 9/11?

NAME: TERRY
No, uh, what's your stance?

NAME: KUMAIL
What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm...
Anti. It was a tragedy.
I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.

NAME: BETH
Huh?

NAME: KUMAIL
That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
joke about it.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Hey, can I come?

NAME: TERRY                            BETH
Yeah.                         No.

NAME: BETH
Whatever.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
I know this isn't the news you were
hoping for but we aren't ready to bring
Emily out of the coma yet.

NAME: BETH
Oh. I-

NAME: TERRY
What happened?

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
what we'd hoped they would, and we
don't want to mess around. So we're
going to perform surgery tomorrow
morning to remove the infection.

NAME: BETH
Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
that the antibiotics would work. He
didn't say anything at all about
surgery.

NAME: TERRY
What does that mean? What kind of
surgery?

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
common procedure. We're going to go in
between the ribs and remove the
infection.

NAME: TERRY
How do you spell that please? Thora- ?
What's the last part?

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
-Centesis.

NAME: BETH
And where is the infection?

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
On the lung.

NAME: BETH
What's the risk?

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
Low. My advice to you is that you go
home, you get something to eat, and try
to relax.

NAME: TERRY
She left the lights on, eh?

NAME: BETH
My favorite sweater.

NAME: BETH (CONT'D)
I'm gonna do some research.

NAME: TERRY
Oh hey, that's the book I gave her.

NAME: BETH
No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you
have that little notebook from the
doctors?

NAME: TERRY
No, this is the book I gave her.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms
real quick.

NAME: BETH
I remember. I met her at the falafel
place and then we went to that book store
that's hardly ever open and I bought it
for her.

NAME: TERRY
You're not the only one who gives her
things.

NAME: BETH
What's up with you?

NAME: TERRY
I'm just tired of you thinking that
you're the only one who gives her things.
I gave her that book.

NAME: BETH
Look at the inscription.

NAME: TERRY
No. That's stupid.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey.

NAME: TERRY
Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I
was just wondering if we wanna do
anything. Got any parlor games...

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't-what are parlor games?

NAME: TERRY
Card games, word games. You play any word
games?

NAME: KUMAIL
No, I've never played-

NAME: TERRY
You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?

NAME: KUMAIL
How does that go?

NAME: TERRY
It's basically where you try to find a
word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme.

NAME: KUMAIL
Ok, Stonehenge.

NAME: TERRY
Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a
winner.

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't play board games. I play video
games.

NAME: TERRY
That's the thing. Everybody now needs
Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a
thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a
piece of chalk and a pavement, that's
your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac
toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you
go, three games right there.

NAME: KUMAIL
Jimmy was a real guy?

NAME: TERRY
Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy,
whoever got hit with the chalk, he was
the Jimmy.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
I'm just trying to figure out what to do.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd
love to, but I'm actually gigging
tonight, which is like an industry word
we use for when we do shows.

NAME: TERRY
Really?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, there's a big Montreal Comedy
festival audition coming up, and I'm
actually headlining tonight.

NAME: TERRY
Oh. That's cool. I haven't been to
comedy show since the 80's - Rita
Rudner at Caroline's. Remember that,
hon?

NAME: BETH
Christ. Pleural effusion and empyema, --

NAME: TERRY
Maybe we should go to Kumail's show.
What do you think? Wouldn't that be
fun?

NAME: BETH
Oh my god. These pictures are horrible.

NAME: TERRY
Okay listen, why don't we go to the
comedy club with him? It'll take our
mind off of things right now.

NAME: BETH
I don't want to get my mind off it,
Terry. Our daughter's having surgery
tomorrow.

NAME: TERRY
Please. I need the distraction.

NAME: BETH
Well then why don't you go?

NAME: TERRY
No, I want you to come with me. I don't
wanna be alone.

NAME: BETH
All right. But I'm bringing my iPad.

NAME: KUMAIL
Ah it's sold out. I should've said it
before you guys had the whole
discussion. It sold out super quickly.
They were shocked at how quickly it
sold out.

NAME: TERRY
But you can get us in? You're the
headliner, right? That's what you said.
I mean, if you're the headliner, you
can get two more in, right?

NAME: KUMAIL
That's a good point.

NAME: TERRY
We'll sit in the back. They got food
there?

NAME: KUMAIL
They've got waffle fries and um-

NAME: TERRY
The hospital had waffle fries too.

NAME: SUMERA
I've actually never been to   Pakistan. My
parents moved here for grad   school and
they just stayed here. I've   never even
been to Canada. So uh, when   is Kumail
coming?

NAME: SHARMEEN
He's coming. Right, Naveed? Traffic?

NAME: NAVEED
I heard everything's bumper-to-bumper
on the Dan Ryan Expressway.

NAME: SUMERA
That's weird because I took the Dan
Ryan Expressway here.

NAME: CHRIS
What is your dad's sister's favorite kind
of music to dance to?

NAME: KUMAIL
Emily's parents are here.

NAME: MARY
Tonight? Why?

NAME: CHRIS
Is anybody here from out of town?

NAME: CHRIS (CONT'D)
A few, a few. What's your name, sir?

NAME: TERRY
Terry.

NAME: CHRIS
Terry. And who's this lady next to you?
Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth?

NAME: BETH
It's Beth.

NAME: CHRIS
Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where
are you guys from?

NAME: TERRY
We're from North Carolina.

NAME: CHRIS
Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State!
Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what
brings you to Chicago?

NAME: BETH
Our daughter's in a coma.

NAME: CHRIS
Where are you from?

NAME: SUMERA
It's getting late, I should go.

NAME: AZMAT
No, I think I should call him up, I'll
just call him up.
Hello, Kumi-beta? What do you mean, who
is calling? This is your father. Ok, ok.
He will be here any moment.
I just faked that call. Did you call
him?

NAME: NAVEED
A hundred times. No response.

NAME: SUMERA
I think I should make something clear.
I can understand what you're saying.

NAME: FATIMA
I thought you said you'd never been to
Pakistan.

NAME: SUMERA
I said I'd never been there but we speak
it at home.

NAME: AZMAT
For someone who's never been to Pakistan
you speak Urdu very well.

NAME: SUMERA
Thanks.

NAME: AZMAT
Do you want to sing?

NAME: KUMAIL
I want to name my kid Void so he won't be
able to cash any of his paychecks.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry, sir, this says Void on it. But
that's my name. Curse you, father!
I work on the second floor of the bank in
this fantasy scenario.

NAME: HECKLER
Go back to ISIS!

NAME: KUMAIL
Toast is a really strange food.

NAME: BETH
What did you just say?

NAME: HECKLER
I said, he should go back to ISIS.

NAME: KUMAIL
Toast is the only food that-

NAME: BETH
Well that's a really confusing
position. Do you want ISIS to have more
people?

NAME: HECKLER
No I was saying that to him because...

NAME: BETH
Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS
recruiter here.

NAME: KUMAIL
Glad we got to the bottom of that.
Toast is like a-

NAME: BETH
What is it about him that made you say
that?

NAME: KUMAIL
I think we know what the answer is.

NAME: HECKLER
Lady I wasn't talking to you.

NAME: BETH
What is it about him?

NAME: KUMAIL
We don't have to go down this path. We
know what's at the end of it.

NAME: HECKLER
Cuz of how he looks.

NAME: KUMAIL
There it is.

NAME: BETH
That is like saying that all frat boys
wearing country club hats and Hawaiian
shirts have shriveled up, tiny little
dicks!

NAME: KUMAIL
Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for
you to find out, but he's right. I
actually am a terrorist. I just do
stand-up comedy on the side to keep a
low profile.

NAME: HECKLER
Fuck you.

NAME: KUMAIL
First of all, very clever. Did you write
that at home? Toast is-

NAME: BETH
Fuck you!

NAME: HECKLER
Fuck you.

NAME: BETH
No fuck you!

NAME: HECKLER
You're a bitch, you know that?

NAME: BETH
(being dragged out by
security)
I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your
fucking phone number?!

NAME: TERRY
I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
I'm not sorry actually cause you're a
terrible person... I don't want to kick
your ass here in front of everybody.
Yeah, that's right. I've got levels,
motherfucker. This elevator goes all
the way fucking down, you fucking
prick!

NAME: BETH
I think I'll make tea.
Actually I'll open a bottle of wine.
Does Emily have whiskey?

NAME: KUMAIL
On top of the fridge.

NAME: TERRY
So uh, Cubs doing good, huh?

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't know anything about baseball.

NAME: BETH
I am so sorry about that. That was... I
just sort of lost control.

NAME: TERRY
I thought it was sexy.

NAME: KUMAIL
Me too. Not like sexy, but like cool
sexy. Not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna
not say sexy anymore.

NAME: BETH
Hey, you guys wanna get something to eat?

NAME: BETH
So is it always like that?

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh like tonight? No, usually a
different mom comes in to help me. I'm
joking. No, it's not always like that.
I'd quit if it was.

NAME: TERRY
Here's a joke.

NAME: BETH
No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as
funny as a fart at a funeral.

NAME: TERRY
This is funny, this is a funny one. A
giraffe walks into a bar and he says to
the bartender, "Highballs on me." You
get it, right?

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh that was the end of the joke?

NAME: TERRY
Yes.

NAME: KUMAIL
That was the whole joke?

NAME: TERRY
That's the joke. That's the beauty of it,
boom.

NAME: KUMAIL
I thought there was more.

NAME: TERRY
He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would
stand to reason his testicles are high
and a highball is a type of drink, and
you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny
first.

NAME: KUMAIL
No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly
explained.

NAME: TERRY
You're just busting my high balls.

NAME: TERRY
Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel.
Good. How about you?

NAME: KUMAIL
Hmm, fruit-forward.

NAME: TERRY
Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward.

NAME: KUMAIL
This one is in the front seat. It's
driving the wine car.

NAME: TERRY
Exactly.

NAME: BETH
I like wine cause of the buzz.

NAME: TERRY
She's a bit of a lightweight.

NAME: BETH
So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the
sofa in less than an hour!

NAME: TERRY
Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not
true.

NAME: BETH
You weren't supposed to be on the show
tonight, were you?

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah
I was. I was the headliner.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Okay. I lied about the show to get out
of hanging out with you guys. And then
I lied about headlining to impress you
guys.

NAME: BETH
Well that didn't work.

NAME: KUMAIL
Also, I think I screwed up with your
daughter.

NAME: BETH
Yeah, you did.
I don't know how people do it when
their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he
got cancer, then he had a stroke, then
a heart attack, then he had a
recurrence of the cancer. But you know
what killed him?

NAME: KUMAIL
Cancer?

NAME: BETH
Car accident. We think maybe it was a
heart attack while he was driving. And
he did still have cancer too. And you
know what? He ate sprouts his whole
fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30
years. I don't know how I'm going to
sleep tonight.

NAME: KUMAIL
You wanna stress eat?

NAME: BETH
Fuck yeah.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh my god.

NAME: BETH
Most noticeable. Oh no, hold on,
there's more.

NAME: BETH (CONT'D)
The legendary cemetery photo shoot.

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh my god.

NAME: BETH
I laughed so hard when I saw these. She
got so mad at me.

NAME: KUMAIL
You're gonna wake him up.

NAME: BETH
Are you kidding me? He can sleep through
anything. Hey Terry!

NAME: KUMAIL
How did you and Terry meet?

NAME: BETH
I was going to East Carolina University
and I was waiting tables. We met at
this coffee shop, I was waiting on him.
I liked his hair. He was a teacher
already. Thick New York accent like
nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for
me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
family could not stand him. We're all
military people, army pilots. All my
brothers played football. Terry
couldn't even change a tire. My father
got so mad he broke every dinner plate
we had. Now back then, you go to the
gas station, you fill up your tank, you
get a dinner plate. But just one at a
time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of
fill-ups to get the whole set back. And
Terry just stuck around. Eventually
they just all got over it.

NAME: KUMAIL
They just got over it. How?

NAME: BETH
Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your
parents meet, Kumail?

NAME: KUMAIL
So we have arranged marriage as you
know. A big group got together to see a
movie, but really it was just a set up
so my mom and dad could meet.

NAME: BETH
What movie did they see?

NAME: KUMAIL
I have no idea. I never asked.

NAME: BETH
She's great, you know?

NAME: KUMAIL
I know.

NAME: BETH
I feel good about this surgery.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. These doctors know what they're
doing.

NAME: BETH
No they don't. They're just winging it
like everybody else.

NAME: KUMAIL
Fuck.

NAME: EMILY'S VOICE
Hey it's me. So I tried making some
Pakistani food to surprise you. And
either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani
food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye!

NAME: EMILY'S VOICE
Hey it's me. If you just wanna come over
and like kiss me for two seconds, I'd
really love that tonight. Ok. Bye!

NAME: EMILY'S VOICE (CONT'D)
Hey it's me. So did you want to meet at
the gallery, or - Oh my god! Oh my god, a
bird just hit me in the head. Oh my god
I'm not kidding. I'll call you right
back. Oh my god, is it okay?

NAME: DR. SPELLMAN
The infection around the lungs was
removed. We should be able to pull her
out soon.

NAME: TERRY
Oh boy.

NAME: BETH
How soon?

NAME: DR. SPELLMAN
She should be up by tomorrow morning at
the latest. We'll also test the pleural
fluid from the thoracentesis so we can
create a more targeted antibiotic
strategy.

NAME: BETH
So this is good news?

NAME: DR. SPELLMAN
It's very good news. We'll just hold
onto her for a few more days and then
you can have her back.

NAME: TERRY
She's a fighter, right?

NAME: DR. SPELLMAN
Yes.

NAME: SHARMEEN
I was so worried. We saw on the news
that a train derailed and we thought
that you were on the train and you had
died.

NAME: KUMAIL
Nobody died on that train, Ma.

NAME: SHARMEEN
But did they look under the train?

NAME: AZMAT
So, where were you last night? What were
you doing?

NAME: KUMAIL
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Kumail.

NAME: KUMAIL
Alright, I'll tell you. I was...
studying for the LSAT.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Really?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm
gonna go to law school, become a
lawyer, and do law.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Oh, let me see who that could be.

NAME: KUMAIL
Really, Dad? You said that nobody was
gonna come. That it was gonna be just
us.

NAME: NAVEED
Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People
say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, I know.

NAME: FATIMA
He should be on Saturday Night Live.

NAME: SHARMEEN
Everybody remember Khadija? She just
dropped in. She was just in the
neighborhood.

NAME: SHARMEEN (CONT'D)
And these are her parents, Farhan and
Tina. They also just dropped in.

NAME: KHADIJA
I've just been through so many of these
appointments and I never have anything in
common with the guys. You know when girls
at work complain about dating, I just
want to body slam them. They have no
idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm
becoming the bruised apple at the bottom
of the apple bucket.

NAME: KUMAIL
No, no. You're not.

NAME: KHADIJA
I am.

NAME: KUMAIL
You're not.

NAME: KHADIJA
So do you want to hangout sometime? Like
without our parents? Have you been to the
cat cafe? The cats just come up to you
and nestle in your lap and you just pet
them.

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't think that's a good idea.

NAME: KHADIJA
You don't like cats?

NAME: KUMAIL
I mean I don't think it's a good idea for
us to hangout again. It's not you. You're
fantastic. I just can't do this arranged
marriage thing -- with anybody.

NAME: KHADIJA
So why did you meet me?

NAME: KUMAIL
It wasn't my idea.

NAME: KHADIJA
I'm just really tired. Do you ever want
to just be in a relationship so you can
finally relax?

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.

NAME: KHADIJA
People are always telling me what I
deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so
sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.

NAME: KHADIJA (CONT'D)
And you know what? I watched the X-Files,
like three whole episodes, and it's a bad
show.

NAME: TERRY
Wow, they should call this website,
"Everything is Cancer Dot Com".
Everything you put in, it could be
cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on.
You take the fun out of hiccups now.

NAME: BETH
Do you know this is the 17th best
hospital in Chicago?

NAME: TERRY
Really? Out of how many?

NAME: BETH
I don't know, but Northwestern's number
one.

NAME: TERRY
Well how do they rate it? What's their
methodology?

NAME: BETH
I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad.

NAME: TERRY
It's not great, unless the sample size
is, you know, that all depends.

NAME: KUMAIL
Here, look at the comments.

NAME: TERRY
This is why I don't want to go online
cause it's never good. You go online,
they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best
movie ever.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
Terry - Hi. Can we talk?

NAME: TERRY
Yeah.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
We got the biopsy results. They are
unfortunately inconclusive. We are
concerned-

NAME: TERRY
They couldn't find out what the disease
was, or where the virus came from or
the bacteria or whatever.

NAME: KUMAIL
But they took out the infection so it
shouldn't matter?

NAME: TERRY
I know, that's what I said but her
vitals didn't normalize. And now they
say that the infection is continuing to
spread, it's in her kidneys.

NAME: KUMAIL
But the kidneys are so far from the
lungs.

NAME: TERRY
I know, it's an aggressive infection
and they said what they gotta do now is
figure out what this mystery disease
actually is.

NAME: BETH
I'm calling Northwestern.

NAME: TERRY
Just hold on, hold on.

NAME: BETH
Terry! Goddammit!

NAME: KUMAIL
I think we should talk about this--

NAME: BETH
--You shut up! I'm sick of this shit,
Terry. We're getting her out of here!

NAME: TERRY
They're in the middle of the whole
process of elimination.

NAME: BETH
So you're saying Northwestern can't
take that information and continue the
search? This place is a shithole.

NAME: BETH (CONT'D)
I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?

NAME: TERRY
Will you just stop for a second? They're
the doctors. You act like you know what
you're talking about. You don't.

NAME: BETH
I can't find my cellphone. You got a
phone?

NAME: TERRY
Don't give her a phone. You don't need a
phone. You don't need to call anybody
right now.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
They're doing it. They're the experts
here, and I trust them.

NAME: BETH
Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can
you unlock that thing?

NAME: TERRY
Oh - you think that you're smarter than
me because you say big sentences. Well
you're not!

NAME: BETH
I don't think I'm smarter than you! You
just don't think you're as smart as I
am! That's not my fault!

NAME: TERRY
Right. It's never your fault.
Everything's my fault.

NAME: BETH
Oh there are some things that are
definitely just your fault.

NAME: TERRY
Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop
freaking out and calm down.

NAME: BETH
And you need to stop being a coward.

NAME: TERRY
Greatest hits, coming back. You can
stop, I'll replay the rest of this from
memory.

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Oh, you're giraffe-ing it.

NAME: KUMAIL
It was the biggest thing they had. I
don't even know if she likes giraffes. We
never talked about giraffes. Hey, do
they know what they're doing? Cause
they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme
Disease? You know the girl on The Real
World had it? Did you guys look for
that?

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Yes, we did.

NAME: KUMAIL
Did you know she gets hurt all the
time? She messed up her ankle recently -
could that be Lupus?

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Kumail. We're looking into everything.
We're not holding anything back from
you. We're still just eliminating
possibilities.

NAME: KUMAIL
Cause Beth wants to move her to
Northwestern.

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The
hospital will approve it because it'll
get the liability off their hands, but
we put her in a coma for a reason. To
stabilize her. Moving her could be very
dangerous. The infection could spread.
Trust me she is fighting. And so are
we.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey Terry. I was just talking to the
nurse - You okay?

NAME: TERRY
Yeah, of course. Totally fine.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait
here until they kick me out. Keep an
eye on her.

NAME: KUMAIL
Do you wanna crash at my place?

NAME: TERRY
You got the golf channel?

NAME: KUMAIL
No.

NAME: TERRY
That wasn't funny, right?

NAME: KUMAIL
I thought that was a serious question.

NAME: TERRY
Let's get the fuck out of here.

NAME: KUMAIL
So this is the place.

NAME: TERRY
Wow...this place is terrible.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was
saying that moving Emily could be a bad
idea.

NAME: TERRY
Really?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, she said it could be dangerous.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Like...

NAME: TERRY
No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
to trade places with Emily. Being a
parent, it's a nightmare. Loving
somebody this much sucks.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah.

NAME: TERRY
And I guess you've noticed some tension
between Beth and me.

NAME: KUMAIL
Not really. That's none of my business.

NAME: TERRY
Yeah well, it's there. Big time.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's getting really late. We should go
to sleep.

NAME: TERRY
I cheated on her.

NAME: KUMAIL
Fuuuuck.

NAME: TERRY
I did. It was just a one night stand.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay.

NAME: TERRY
We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
have these teacher conferences. Who
goes to a math conference to get laid?

NAME: KUMAIL
Math teachers?

NAME: TERRY
Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's
what it was.

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a
full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-

NAME: TERRY
She just smelled so good. It was horrible
too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
as I'd finished, I was like, what did you
fucking do?! What did you just do?!

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
What did you do?! You know that moment of
clarity you get right after an orgasm?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yup.

NAME: TERRY
I told Beth right away. I had to. She
was devastated. Now she hates me.

NAME: KUMAIL
She might be mad at you, but she doesn't
hate you. You should've heard the way she
was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you
something? Why did you tell her?

NAME: TERRY
Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt.

NAME: KUMAIL
Do you guys talk about it?

NAME: TERRY
Not anymore. She said she forgave me,
but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
some advice Kumail. You're going to
know the woman you want to spend the
rest of your life with when you cheat
on her. When you cheat on her and you
just feel like shit.

NAME: KUMAIL
So, to fully know I love someone, I
have to cheat on them?

NAME: TERRY
Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's
terrible advice.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
Love isn't easy. That's why they call
it love.

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't really get that either.

NAME: TERRY
I know. I thought I could just start
saying something and something smart
would come out.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey did you see Terry?

NAME: CHRIS
No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm
going to Sevies. You want anything?

NAME: KUMAIL
No, I'm good, thank you.

NAME: CHRIS
You don't want a hot dog or nothing?

NAME: KUMAIL
Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.

NAME: CHRIS
Okay, no hot dog.

NAME: SHARMEEN
We just spoke to Khadija's parents.

NAME: KUMAIL
What are you doing here?

NAME: SHARMEEN
What is wrong with you, Kumi?

NAME: KUMAIL
Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-

NAME: SHARMEEN
Sorry? That's all you have to say?

NAME: KUMAIL
I wasn't that into her.

NAME: SHARMEEN
"Into her"? Do you know how difficult
it is to get an appointment with her?
She is in very high demand.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay. So?

NAME: SHARMEEN
So?

NAME: KUMAIL
Can we please talk about this another
time?

NAME: SHARMEEN
No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this
now. We have sacrificed everything for
you.

NAME: KUMAIL
I know, okay?

NAME: SHARMEEN
We have left our family. We have left
our home. I have missed the birth of my
sister's daughter. I have not seen my
mother for fifteen years. Your father,
he had to do his graduate school.
Again. He had to give exams. Again.

NAME: AZMAT
I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s.
They used to call me Father Time!

NAME: KUMAIL
I know that. I really appreciate
everything you did for me, but can we
talk about this another time?

NAME: SHARMEEN
Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer,
fine. If you want to do the stand-up
comedy and embarrass us as a family,
fine. There is only one thing that we
have ever asked from you: that you be a
good Muslim and that you marry a
Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!

NAME: KUMAIL
Can I ask you something that has never
made sense to me? Why did you bring me
here if you wanted me to not have an
American life?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
We come here but we pretend like we're
still back there? That's so stupid!

NAME: AZMAT
Don't you talk to your mother like
that!

NAME: KUMAIL
You don't care what I think. You just
want me to follow the rules. But the
rules don't make sense to me. I don't
pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in
years. I just go down there and I play
video games.

NAME: AZMAT
You don't believe in Allah?

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't know what I believe, Dad! I
don't know. And I can't marry someone
you find for me.

NAME: SHARMEEN
And why not?

NAME: KUMAIL
Because I'm in love with someone. I am.
Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a
therapist. And right now she's very
sick but I couldn't tell you that. It
makes me so sad that I couldn't tell
you any of that. I really appreciate
everything you've done for me. I truly,
truly do. And I know Islam has been
really good for you, it has made you
good people, but I don't know what I
believe. I just need to figure it out
on my own.

NAME: SHARMEEN
You're not my son.

NAME: AZMAT
Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not
thinking about us. You're not thinking
about Khadija. In fact you're not even
thinking about that girl that you are in
love with. You think American Dream is
just about doing whatever you want and
not thinking about other people?

NAME: AZMAT (CONT'D)
You're wrong! You are wrong!

NAME: CHRIS
Hey... I never went to the store. I was
just listening at the door. My mom kicked
me out for dealing weed at sixteen, so I
get it man.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey, so when are we going to talk to Beth
about what we talked about?

NAME: TERRY
We're gonna move her.

NAME: KUMAIL
What? What are you talking about? You
fucking caved?

NAME: TERRY
I didn't cave. I don't cave.

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're
great. But we talked about this last
night.

NAME: TERRY
I know. We're moving her. She's right.

NAME: KUMAIL
What? No. I told you what the nurse
said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that
moving Emily could be a very bad idea.

NAME: BETH
Well Northwestern told us it could be
very good.

NAME: KUMAIL
Well, they don't see her. This nurse
sees her and she told me herself.

NAME: TERRY
It's okay. They don't need to see her.

NAME: KUMAIL
It's not okay. There. I got it!

NAME: TERRY
That's a map of the garage.

NAME: KUMAIL
Wait, wait! Do you want to be
responsible? She could die!

NAME: BETH
Kumail, we're responsible for her no
matter what. We're her parents. Now I'm
sorry, we're moving her.

NAME: STU
Welcome to Quick'n Hot. May I take your
order please?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, um can I get a burger with 4
slices of cheese.

NAME: STU
Four burgers. Anything else sir?

NAME: KUMAIL
No. One burger with four slices of
cheese.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
One burger with four-

NAME: STU
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

NAME: KUMAIL
Just put 4 slices of cheese on a
burger.

NAME: STU
We can't do that. There's no button -

NAME: KUMAIL
Who the fuck is this "we", man? Who the
fuck is this "we"? It's me and you.
We're just people. Fucking listen to
me. Fuck this corporate entity. Put
four slices of cheese on THE FUCKING

NAME: STU
We can't do that.

NAME: KUMAIL
What the fuck, you fucking idiot?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human
being. You're a human being. Look at
me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck
me! Look at me. PLEASE!

NAME: STU
Today's my first day.

NAME: KUMAIL
Fuck you!

NAME: STU
I'll just ring you up for four burgers.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm sorry.

NAME: STU
Do you want any fries or drink with
that?

NAME: KUMAIL
I'll take four fries. I'm sorry.

NAME: KUMAIL
Fuck!

NAME: CHRIS
Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh
wait, are you getting all dark and
moody before your set? Yeah, punish
yourself like a nasty little baby.

NAME: KUMAIL
I am not in the mood. Okay Chris?

NAME: CHRIS
I'll get you in the mood.

NAME: CHRIS (CONT'D)
I'll get you all in the mood.

NAME: CJ
You all right?

NAME: KUMAIL
Why does everybody say the same fucking
thing? Yeah, I'm doing great.

NAME: CJ
Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking.

NAME: DODD
The fuck've you been, man? You're on
next!

NAME: DODD
This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail
Nanjiani!

NAME: KUMAIL
Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? Like that's the
name of it, it's called cheese. I saw
all these news reports, and they were
like, there's a new drug, it's called
cheese. Everyone's doing it in the
Midwest, kids are doing it.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
It's just really hard to do stand-up
comedy when your girlfriend is in a
coma.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Not quite sure what part you're
laughing at. They say she's fighting,
but she doesn't look like she's
fighting. She looks like she's just
laying there. I said horrible things to
her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
she gets excited every time she sees a
bird. She's like, look at this, it's a
bird. And I'm always like, yeah,
they're all over the place, they're
birds. But she likes that bird. Every
bird she sees, she sees it.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Her dad just called and said that they
can't transfer her because the infection
has reached her heart. Which means...
She could die.

NAME: KUMAIL
I don't know if you can hear me or not,
but it would be really good if you pulled
through. If you have to go, you can go,
but it would be really great if you
stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I
did -

NAME: EMILY
Mom. You're getting your tears all over
me. When am I gonna be able to feel my
face?

NAME: TERRY
You gave us quite a scare there, Scout.

NAME: EMILY
Scout?

NAME: TERRY
Come on. I call you that all the time.

NAME: EMILY
No. Not since I was a grown up.

NAME: TERRY
I've called you that your whole life!

NAME: NURSE JUDY
Sorry hon.

NAME: EMILY
What is that crap?

NAME: NURSE JUDY
We have to thicken your liquids for a
bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough
to swallow yet.

NAME: EMILY
That shit tastes like semen.

NAME: TERRY
That's nice for a father to hear.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
She won't have any social inhibitions
until the anesthetic wears off.

NAME: EMILY
It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try
this.

NAME: BETH
Oh wait a minute, honey!

NAME: TERRY
Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us
forty eight dollars for it, don't worry
about it.

NAME: EMILY
Why are you here?

NAME: KUMAIL
I haven't heard her voice in a while.

NAME: BETH
He's been here the whole time.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
Could I speak with you both outside?

NAME: BETH
Honey, we'll be right outside.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey.

NAME: DR. CUNNINGHAM
Emily has a rare condition called Adult
Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
still hadn't gone down even after
several days in bed, which is strange.
Still's disease is when the body thinks
healthy tissue is an infection so it
tries to fight it. It's like a big
biological misunderstanding.

NAME: TERRY
Yeah, yeah.

NAME: DR CUNNINGHAM
We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
stabilized within hours. She's gonna
take time to recover but she'll be
fine.

NAME: TERRY
Wow.

NAME: EMILY
What are you doing here?

NAME: KUMAIL
I was visiting someone down the hall and
I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi
to Emily.

NAME: EMILY
Oh.

NAME: KUMAIL
No, I'm joking, I was here for you.

NAME: EMILY
You're an asshole and I don't like you.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.

NAME: EMILY
No, you're an asshole.

NAME: KUMAIL
You have a lot of drugs in you so you're
not thinking as clearly.

NAME: EMILY
Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
to me. You just make me sad. You make me
sad inside of my heart, and it makes me
sad to look at you. So I think you should
probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
want her.

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
Will you please get my mom?

NAME: KUMAIL
Emily wants to see you.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I'm gonna head out. I don't think I
should be here.

NAME: TERRY
Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your
living condition is a potential health
risk and you're not that funny. But....
you're probably not suited to do
anything else either so that's
troublesome--

NAME: KUMAIL
You really made it sound like you were
going to say something positive there.

NAME: TERRY
I guess I did, didn't I? You know I
know the good stuff. You know how I
feel. I gotta get in there.

NAME: KUMAIL
So you gonna hang around Chicago for a
while?

NAME: BETH
Yeah. She's got physical therapy.

NAME: KUMAIL
Did you ever think you'd be excited to
have your daughter go through physical
therapy?
It's so strange that we could go
through one of the most intense
experiences of our lives together and
just never see each other again.

NAME: BETH
Maybe. But I hope not.

NAME: MARY
Hi little sad man. Mopey boy. We have
something to tell you. We are moving to
New York. And we want you to come with
us.

NAME: KUMAIL
Are you serious?

NAME: CJ
You gotta do it. It's going to suck at
first but we'll have each other and
maybe eventually get paid to write
jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on
dude.

NAME: MARY
You have to come. I know you did not
get Montreal and that is only because
you did one of the worst sets I've ever
seen in my goddamn life.

NAME: CJ
It was nonsense.

NAME: MARY
A living disgrace.

NAME: CJ
I would call it shit, but I would be
worried that I'd be insulting actual
shit.

NAME: MARY
Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I
thought a ghost had passed right through
me.

NAME: KUMAIL
We don't have to keep going over how bad
the set was. I saw their faces and the
noises they didn't make.

NAME: MARY
I felt one of my eggs die.

NAME: KUMAIL
Doesn't that happen every month?

NAME: MARY
It happens every month, Kumail, but I
don't always feel it and go, ohhhhh. And
that's what you made me do. I'm packing
my things up and I'm moving to New York,
and guess what, baby? You're coming with
me.

NAME: KUMAIL
What about Chris?

NAME: MARY
He will be fine.

NAME: CJ
There's not enough room in the car,
probably. We leave in a week, all
right? And I already called shotgun
Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this
up.

NAME: MARY
Your destiny awaits!

NAME: CJ
This will be the biggest move of your
life. Other than the one from Pakistan.

NAME: TERRY
Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody
for coming. I just wanted to say a
couple of words here.

NAME: EMILY
Why is Kumail here?

NAME: BETH
Cause he was there the whole time. I
invited the nurses, I invited him.

NAME: TERRY
Emily, come on up here. I wanna say
something.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
Emily successfully peeled an orange
this morning.

NAME: TERRY (CONT'D)
It was a clementine, full disclosure,
it's those little ones that a baby
monkey could peel, but she did it. And
that's all, thank you everybody.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey. I like your cane. I've heard
pimpin' ain't easy.

NAME: EMILY
Right.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey, can we talk for a second?

NAME: EMILY
Sure.

NAME: KUMAIL
So, I've been collecting some things
that are important to me and I wanted
to show them to you. I call this my bag
of devotion.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
This is all the visitor passes from
when I visited you when you were in the-

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
These are the ticket stubs from when
your parents came to see me perform and
I realized how great they are, and how
great you are, and how great honesty
is.

NAME: EMILY
What did you do? Did you cremate
someone?

NAME: KUMAIL
These are the ashes of all the
Pakistani women - not the women - the
pictures of the Pakistani women. I
thought this was a good idea, but it
feels a little stupid.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But
I've changed. And I am the person you
need me to be. I really am. So, will
you take me back?

NAME: EMILY
Kumail, I'm really glad that you went
through this experience, but you have
to understand that all that happened
while I was asleep. Like you felt one
way a few weeks ago and now you're
saying you feel the total opposite way
and the only thing that's changed is
that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
at all of this, and I just think, I
can't do it again. I can't be the
reason that you don't have a family. It
just feels totally different now. And I
can't do that again. Do you understand?

NAME: KUMAIL
Okay.

NAME: KUMAIL
Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no
plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I
won't let you kick me out of the
family. Since I am a member of the
family, it would stand to reason that I
would get a vote in whether or not I
get kicked out, and that vote would
have to be unanimous. Standard
parliamentary procedure. So all those
in favor of not kicking Kumail out of
the family, raise your hand.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the
family, denied. So you guys can just
talk to me.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Okay, you're giving me the silent
treatment. I figured that was what was
going to happen. I have a solution.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
"Hi. How are you?" It's just a real
basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical.
"Always with the comedy." Mom, made
that one specially for you. "Kumail,
how did you become so much more
handsome than your brother Naveed?"

NAME: NAVEED
Bullshit.

NAME: KUMAIL
I admit this one is designed to stir up
some controversy. "It's interesting how
you can't really kick someone out of your
family because they'll always be your
family." I agree with that one. It's a
good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
for you.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
I'm sorry I lied about the girls and
the LSAT and all of that. That was
wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving
to New York to pursue stand-up, but I
am not leaving this family.

NAME: EMILY
What is it?

NAME: EMILY
Okay.

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
I swear you and Dad are just like my
freshman year roommate, but instead of
boning random dudes, you're just
parenting all the time. All over the
place. In every room of the house.
Including right next to me.

NAME: BETH
We gotta go.

NAME: EMILY
Home?

NAME: EMILY (CONT'D)
No.

NAME: BETH
Yeah, it's time.

NAME: EMILY
I'm not ready.

NAME: BETH
Yeah, you know what? You're strong and
you are.

NAME: KUMAIL
And we'd go to the mosque and hear
graphic details of religious people
being killed 1400 years ago. I mean
like Tarantino-esque details. And
everyone would be crying, like
competing to see who could cry the
hardest. And I could never cry. And I
was like, what is wrong with me? Am I
broken?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
The only time I've cried that much is
when I watched the first 15 minutes of
Up. This is a picture of me and my
mother. I'm seven years old.

NAME: TERRY
You know people talk about New York
water but Chicago water is very
underrated, I think. It's good.

NAME: EMILY
Hey guys, I think I might just pop out
for a bit.

NAME: TERRY
By yourself?

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, just hop around the block, maybe
get some frozen yogurt.

NAME: TERRY
Are you okay? Can you do it, can you walk
by yourself?

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, Dad.

NAME: BETH
Have fun.

NAME: TERRY
If you feel a coma coming on, call us.

NAME: EMILY
Dad, it's too soon. I love you, I'll see
you in the morning.

NAME: TERRY
Love you, bye.

NAME: BETH
Have fun.

NAME: EMILY
I will.

NAME: TERRY
Got your phone?

NAME: EMILY
Yeah.

NAME: KUMAIL
But you liked it, huh?

NAME: NAVEED
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

NAME: KUMAIL
Hey!

NAME: EMILY
Hi...

NAME: KUMAIL
What are you doing here?

NAME: EMILY
I was in the neighborhood and I saw
that you were gonna be here so I
thought I'd come say hi.

NAME: KUMAIL
You look great. How's your blood oxygen
level?

NAME: EMILY
Oh, well within range.

NAME: KUMAIL
Nice.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Uh, this is my brother, Naveed.

NAME: EMILY
Hi, I'm Emily.

NAME: NAVEED
I've heard lots about you.

NAME: EMILY
It's so good to finally meet you.
There's actually something I wanted to
tell you.

NAME: NAVEED
Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye.

NAME: BETH
Are you warm enough?

NAME: TERRY
Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of
socks on.

NAME: BETH
Do you mind?

NAME: TERRY
No... no...

NAME: BETH
I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.

NAME: TERRY
Me too. See? I should have brushed my
teeth.

NAME: BETH
I like it.

NAME: EMILY
When something like this happens,
there's this sort of expectation that
you're going to have this completely
new lease on life and feel totally
different about everything. Like
cherish every sunrise. And for the most
part I just feel like, ugh I can't get
up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like
I've been talking about myself so much.
Are you doing a lot of stand-up?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy
Festival audition, like horrifically.

NAME: EMILY
I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be
honest with you, it wasn't great.

NAME: KUMAIL
I know.

NAME: EMILY
But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I
liked.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm moving to New York.

NAME: EMILY
Really?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna
drive out. We have a place already.

NAME: EMILY
When do you leave?

NAME: KUMAIL
Next weekend.

NAME: EMILY
I'm so excited for you. That is great.
I think you are going to do so great in
New York.

NAME: KUMAIL
What were you going to say?

NAME: EMILY
What?

NAME: KUMAIL
You said you were going to say something
to me. What was it?

NAME: EMILY
Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My
parents told me everything you did for me
and I feel like the last time we spoke I
didn't properly thank you so-

NAME: KUMAIL
Oh yeah. Totally fine.

NAME: EMILY
I should probably go.

NAME: KUMAIL
Do you wanna call an Uber?

NAME: EMILY
No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has
been really great. Okay, bye.

NAME: CHRIS
The scene is gonna be so different with
you guys gone.

NAME: KUMAIL
You should... come out...

NAME: CHRIS
Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm gonna miss you.

NAME: CHRIS
Get out of here, you assholes.

NAME: MARY
Come here, you big dummy.

NAME: AZMAT
You are still kicked out of the family,
but because we did not get a proper
chance to say bye to you... Your mother
is so angry with you. She is not going
to get out of the car. She's not even
going to look at you. And I don't
believe you kept so much secret from
me, your father.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'm sorry.

NAME: AZMAT
Here. She asked me to give this to you.

NAME: AZMAT (CONT'D)
Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite.
She made it herself specially for you
with extra potatoes.

NAME: KUMAIL
Thank you Ma.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Is she okay?

NAME: AZMAT
Right now? No.

NAME: KUMAIL
I'll miss you.

NAME: AZMAT
I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It
was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye
forever. And do me a favor, when you
reach New York, just text us and tell
us that you've reached safely, okay?

NAME: KUMAIL
Dad, can I ask you something? When you
and Mom went on your first date, what
movie did you see?

NAME: AZMAT
Satte pe Satta.

NAME: AZMAT (CONT'D)
Her favorite song. Why are you asking?

NAME: KUMAIL
Just curious.

NAME: KUMAIL
So the first time I came to America, I
was fourteen and I was just visiting my
uncle in New York and it just happened
to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
this is every day in America! As
advertised. Every day they have a party
celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
up to that day. So I was lying to my
parents, I was telling them I was gonna
be a lawyer. And they're very
disappointed cause they wanted me to be
a doctor. And you guys are like, why
didn't you just tell them that you
wanted to be a doctor?

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
has to be believable. If I told them I
want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
"bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
ISIS, then comedian.

NAME: KUMAIL (CONT'D)
Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
heckle comedians.

NAME: EMILY
Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
woo-hooed you.

NAME: KUMAIL
Well see that's a common misconception.
Heckling doesn't have to be negative.

NAME: EMILY
So if I was like, oh my god, you're
amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?

NAME: KUMAIL
Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs
than me, and I don't like that. Do you
want to come up, do my job? Are you from
out of town, m'am?

NAME: EMILY
Chicago.

NAME: KUMAIL
Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to
New York?

NAME: EMILY
I'm here to see someone.

NAME: KUMAIL
And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I
don't know what your deal is.

NAME: EMILY
Yeah, I've seen him.

NAME: ARCH
Jeez... knock off the chatter, will
ya.

NAME: NED
Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

NAME: ARCH
I'm awake! Where do you come up with
all that crap about women?

NAME: NED
It's true. Women are very complex,
but if you know how to read 'em...
they're an open book. You can always
tell the rotten apples from the
peaches.

NAME: ARCH
Are you kiddin'?

NAME: NED
I'd stake my career on it. Anybody
ever proves me wrong, I'll throw
away my badge.

NAME: ARCH
Aayyhh... women are trouble...

NAME: NED
I used to believe that too. Until I
married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.

NAME: ARCH
Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,
pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a
beautiful wife waitin' for ya at
home. Everything a guy could ever
want, including NO kids.

NAME: NED
I'd love to have kids.

NAME: ARCH
What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!
Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes
you think Milo's gonna show up here?

NAME: NED
Logic. He knocked off all those banks.
He's got cash. He's gonna want to
spend it. This is one of the few
places that still takes cash. Sooner
or later... he's gotta turn up.

NAME: ARCH
And how we s'posed to recognize this
scumbag?

NAME: NED
The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you
see him... you'll know him.

NAME: ARCH
These are the best damn Nachos in
North America. Maybe the world!

NAME: ARCH
I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.
You want some?

NAME: LOLA
Got a light?

NAME: NED
Sure.

NAME: LOLA
How about a match?

NAME: NED
No thanks. I have plenty.

NAME: LOLA
You really are incredibly stupid,
aren't you? I like that in a man.

NAME: NED
I'd be insulted, but I know you're
serious.

NAME: LOLA
You sound so sure of yourself.

NAME: NED
I'm not as dumb as I look.

NAME: LOLA
Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...

NAME: NED
Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?

NAME: LOLA
Thirsty. What about that drink?

NAME: NED
I'm on duty.

NAME: LOLA
Brain surgeon?

NAME: NED
Cop.

NAME: LOLA
Oooo... and I bet you have a big
gun.

NAME: NED
You lose.

NAME: LOLA
If I can't buy you a drink...
...let me buy you one of those.

NAME: NED
Who can say no to a weiner?

NAME: LOLA
Not me.

NAME: LOLA
Two dogs. Hot.

NAME: NED
You come here often?

NAME: LOLA
Only when I'm in heat.

NAME: NED
Oh! Sorry.

NAME: LOLA
Where ya going?

NAME: NED
Get something to wipe it off.

NAME: LOLA
That's okay. You're doing just fine.

NAME: NED
I'll get you a wet paper towel.

NAME: NED
Hold it right there, Milo!

NAME: RESTROOM PATRON
Look out! He's got a weenie!

NAME: NED
Police emergency! I need your car!

NAME: NED
You take science in high school,
Milo?

NAME: MILO
I skipped high school, cop!

NAME: NED
Then you're probably not familiar
with the theory of inverse
proportionate explosive dynamics.

NAME: MILO
What about it?

NAME: NED
If you fire a weapon with the barrel
obstructed, the explosive force
multiplies by twenty-three point
five nine eight and reverses on itself
with diametric polarity?

NAME: MILO
Yeah. So?

NAME: NED
The gun will blow up in your hand...
and it won't even scorch my pinkie.

NAME: MILO
Ha! That's just theoretical
hypothesis. Inverse proportionate
explosive dynamics has never been
demonstrated conclusively in a
laboratory environment.

NAME: NED
Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart
guy. Let's find out.

NAME: NED
You have the right to remain silent...
next... if you waive that right,
anything you say... next...

NAME: NED
...may be used against you in a court
of law... next... You have the right
to an attorney... Do you have an
attorney?

NAME: MILO
Nahhhh!

NAME: NED
Then today's your lucky day...

NAME: LANA
Not bad for an auto mechanic...

NAME: FRANK
Yeah, well you're not so bad
yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

NAME: LANA
Better watch your tongue, sweetie,
or I'll have my husband arrest you.

NAME: FRANK
Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When
does he ever find time for you?

NAME: LANA
He doesn't. That's why I need you to
keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why
drive a jalopy when you can have a
hot rod?

NAME: FRANK
Maybe you should trade him in on a
new model.

NAME: LANA
I would... if I could make any money
on the deal.

NAME: FRANK
Want to go for another test drive?

NAME: LANA
Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm
still under warranty.

NAME: NED
Morning sweetheart.

NAME: LANA
Uh huh. Want some coffee?

NAME: NED
No thanks.

NAME: LANA
Frank here was just grabbing a little
before going back to work on my car.

NAME: NED
How long you been working on Lana's
Mercedes, Frank?

NAME: FRANK
Oh... I don't know... six, seven
weeks.

NAME: NED
And ya still haven't found the
problem?

NAME: FRANK
Think I got my finger on it though.

NAME: NED
I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't
born yesterday. He's not fixing your
car. He's SCREWING you!

NAME: NED
YOU are screwing my wife! I can see
what your game is, Frank. You open
up her hood, poke around in there...
squirt some lubrication in... play
around with all her parts... then
take an old used piston and stick it
in... then pull it out... in, out,
in, out! Every day! There's no end
to it. You just keep coming and
COMING!... and the bill just gets
bigger and BIGGER!

NAME: NED
But you don't see it, do you, Lana?
You're too good... too pure. You
can't see the evil in people like
him.
Well, you're not getting away with
it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're
fired!

NAME: LANA
Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

NAME: NED
Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late
for court.

NAME: NED
You are so naive.

NAME: NED
Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

NAME: FRANK
Who's that?

NAME: LANA
Just the postman. He always rings
twice.

NAME: NED
Laura... do you know where...?

NAME: LAURA
Right here. The judge decided to
skip arraignment and take Milo direct
to trial. You're six minutes late,
but don't sweat it. You got Judge
Allen. He's always eleven minutes
late.

NAME: LAURA
I suggest you try Lemming versus
Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped
in the water and everybody followed.

NAME: NED
Yeah. Good idea.

NAME: NED
I don't know what I'd do without
you?

NAME: LAURA
Really?

NAME: NED
Laura, how long have you worked for
me?

NAME: LAURA
Two years, seven months, twenty-three
days, nineteen hours...
...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.
...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-
five... fifty-six...

NAME: NED
And when was the last time I gave
you a raise?

NAME: LAURA
Never. But that's okay. I don't need
a raise. In fact... I was thinking
of giving you a rebate on my salary.

NAME: NED
Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

NAME: NED
Laura. Laura! What is it?

NAME: LAURA
I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a
bit... claustrophobic... in the
bathroom.

NAME: NED
Maybe we should try some prune juice.

NAME: LAURA
Wear the blue one.

NAME: NED
Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...
does this look like the face of a
crook?

NAME: NED
Of course it does. But the question
of my client's guilt or innocence is
not the issue here today. I'm certain
every member of the jury can clearly
see that he's guilty!

NAME: BLIND JUROR
I can't.

NAME: NED
Put yourself in his shoes. Look
through his eyes. See the world the
way HE sees it!

NAME: NED
Things just don't look the same.
It's fuzzy... and frightening!

NAME: NED
Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley
is not the perpetrator here. He is
the VICTIM!

NAME: NED
Like ALL of us... this man is the
unfortunate victim of these tragically
difficult economic times. And what
does that mean? He can't support his
family!

NAME: NED
For God's sake!... He can't even
support his own FACE!

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum
in my courtroom... unless you have
enough for everyone.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Bailiff. Pass these out.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
And don't forget the jury.

NAME: NED
And so, desperate and broke, with no
other options before him, Mr. Crumley
went to eleven Savings & Loans and
did what any of you would have done.
He stole back the money that the
S&Ls had stolen from him!

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Mr. Ravine... please approach the
bench.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
You're not running for congress here,
so knock off the speeches and quit
inciting these brainless morons! Now
pick up the pace and wrap this son-
of-a-bitch up! Call your first
witness.

NAME: NED
I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

NAME: BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

NAME: NED
I do.

NAME: NED
Detective Ravine, at the time of the
arrest, did you read the defendant
his Miranda rights?

NAME: NED
Of course. That's standard procedure.

NAME: NED
Are these the cards Officer Brooks
used to prompt you while reading Mr.
Crumley his rights?

NAME: NED
Yeah. These are them.

NAME: NED
Reading from the cards now... quote
"You have the right to remain silent,
if you waive that right, anything
you say... may be used against you
in a court of law." Is that right?

NAME: NED
That's right.

NAME: NED
WRONG! The official Miranda warning
is... "anything you say CAN be used
against you in a court of law." Not
"may"... "CAN!"
Don't you know the difference between
"can" and "may", Detective? Every
school kid knows "can" is a verb
that indicates ability to perform,
while "may" is a verbal auxiliary
indicating the permission to act.

NAME: NED
I didn't have time to worry about
past participles or interrogative
pronouns! I was trying to protect
society from a deranged MADMAN!
But this ivy league fop...!!!

NAME: NED
I have no more use for this witness.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Mr. Ravine...

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
I'm dismissing this case on the
grounds of improper grammar.

NAME: NED
Ow!

NAME: PROSECUTOR
But your Honor...!

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
I know, I know. It's a technicality.
But it's the kind of technicality
that makes the American legal system
what it is today! Court's adjourned!

NAME: LOLA
I waited. You never came back.

NAME: NED
I got busy. Here's that paper towel
I promised.

NAME: LOLA
Thanks...

NAME: NED
How'd you get in? The door was locked.

NAME: LOLA
It's miraculous what a real woman
can do... with a bobbie pin.

NAME: LOLA
Cigarette?

NAME: NED
No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

NAME: LOLA
Yes, I know. I like things that are
bad for me.
So... I hear you go both ways.

NAME: NED
Only once. It was a fraternity prank.
I never saw him again.

NAME: LOLA
No, I mean... you're a cop and a
lawyer.

NAME: NED
Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of
scum out there on the streets... but
they all deserve a fair and costly
trial.

NAME: LAURA
I'll get that.

NAME: NED
Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

NAME: LOLA
Lola Cain.

NAME: LOLA
So lovely to meet you, Laura.

NAME: NED
Gotta keep these darn books in their
right place or we'll never find the
ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...
R thru B... W thru F...

NAME: LAURA
It's getting late. I'll give you a
ride home, Ned.

NAME: NED
I have my car.

NAME: LAURA
I'll tow you.

NAME: NED
Not today. You don't need to wait.
I'll see you tomorrow.

NAME: LAURA
I should call someone to fix this...

NAME: NED
Tomorrow...

NAME: LAURA
I'll call from home.

NAME: LOLA
I think I should warn you, Mr.
Ravine... I'm not wearing any
underwear.

NAME: NED
Try these on.

NAME: NED
So... what can I do for you?

NAME: LOLA
I've run across some... papers...
and I thought you might be able to
tell me what they are. You see, I'm
not very experienced when it comes
to... papers.

NAME: NED
I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.
Do you have the... papers... here?

NAME: LOLA
No... they're at home. I thought you
might stop by...

NAME: NED
I'm on duty tonight.

NAME: LOLA
Don't they ever give you a night
off?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Tomorrow.

NAME: LOLA
Why don't we meet tomorrow evening
then?

NAME: LOLA
I'll let you know where.

NAME: NED
What's wrong with my office?

NAME: LOLA
Nothing a good interior decorator
couldn't fix.

NAME: LOLA
Take care of this for me, will ya?

NAME: FRANK
I came back for my shower cap.

NAME: LANA
Yeah, well you came to the right
place.

NAME: LANA
Sit down.

NAME: FRANK
Where is he?

NAME: LANA
On duty all night. By the time he
wraps up his reports, it'll be close
to noon tomorrow.

NAME: LANA
I was just reading over...

NAME: LANA
Take off the hat, Frank.

NAME: LANA
I was just reading over my husband's
insurance policies. You wouldn't
know anything about insurance, would
you, Frankie?

NAME: FRANK
Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies
part-time. I got half a brain... or
didn't you notice?

NAME: LANA
I musta had my eye on something else.
How about a translation.

NAME: FRANK
Standard accident policy... all the
usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The
face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three
million bucks!
And there's a triple indemnity rider.

NAME: LANA
Meaning?

NAME: FRANK
Aw, it's just something agents throw
in so we can boost the premium. If
the policy holder dies under very
specific conditions, it pays off
three times the face value of the
policy.

NAME: LANA
Nine million dollars...?

NAME: FRANK
Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the
company. Nobody ever collects.

NAME: LANA
Why not?

NAME: FRANK
Well, like here... it only pays off
if he's shot with a pistol, falls
from a moving northbound train and
drowns in a fresh water stream.

NAME: LANA
All three?

NAME: FRANK
See what I mean, sweetheart? What
are the odds of that?

NAME: LANA
It could happen.
Suppose it did happen?

NAME: FRANK
Then you'd be rich.

NAME: LANA
Then we'd be rich.

NAME: FRANK
What're you sayin'...?

NAME: LANA
We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!
And I know exactly how! He has a
legal symposium in Santa Barbara
this weekend... All we have to do is
get him to take the train up instead
of driving.

NAME: FRANK
How we gonna do that? Didn't you
tell me he hates trains?

NAME: LANA
That's where you come in, baby. You're
gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.
That should be no problem for you.

NAME: LANA
Then... we give him a lift to the
train station... through Dealey Plaza,
past the Book Suppository and around
the grassy knoll...

NAME: FRANK
Isn't that out of our way?

NAME: LANA
Move, Frank.

NAME: LANA
And pay attention.

NAME: LANA
Ten minutes out of the station he'll
be standing in the vestibule between
cars... trying to avoid a panic
attack. Fourteen minutes and ten
seconds out, the train crosses the
Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen
minutes and fifty-four seconds, I
shoot him, shove him out the door...
he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!
A triple play. We're rich!

NAME: FRANK
You been thinking about this a lot,
haven't you?

NAME: LANA
No. It just came to me.
I had this image of a big, powerful,
throbbing train... plunging into a
long, dark, wet tunnel.

NAME: NED
Stand over there and shut up!

NAME: NED
Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want
to hear language like that!

NAME: ARCH
Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.
You seem a little tense tonight.
What is it?

NAME: NED
Aw... I don't know. I guess it's
Lana. It's just... I know she wants
to have a baby so bad...

NAME: NED
...but I never get to spend any time
with her. And when I am home... it's
like she's, you know... avoiding
sex.

NAME: NED
That can't be it. I'm the tenderest
guy on the force. Nah... I think
she's just afraid she won't be able
to get pregnant.

NAME: ARCH
What's to be afraid! It's like making
breakfast! You bring home the bacon...
she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it
up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got
an omelette in the oven!
Why don't you knock off early... go
home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake
up in the morning and find you there
for a change.

NAME: NED
Naw... I can't. I got all this
paperwork.

NAME: ARCH
Don't worry about that.

NAME: OTHER GANG MEMBERS
Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

NAME: WILLARD SCOTT
...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of
Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and
thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of
female! Smokes three cigars a day,
drinks a straight shot of vodka at
bedtime... and still has sex!

NAME: NED
Damn birds!

NAME: LAURA
My God, Ned... you look like you
were hit by a bus.

NAME: NED
I was.
Who's in my office?

NAME: LAURA
Max Shady's mother.

NAME: NED
Not again.

NAME: NED
Hello, Mrs. Shady.

NAME: NED
Laura... check on my insurance. Make
sure it's paid up.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,
is getting out of prison tomorrow.

NAME: NED
Gee, has it been seven years already?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Seven long, miserable years in the
slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

NAME: NED
Well, being locked in a tiny room
with no TV can make a guy feel pretty
tense.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
I'm very concerned about him, Mr.
Ravine. He said you were a two-bit
shyster... and he's going to rip
your head off and use it for a bowling
ball!

NAME: NED
I'm sure the experience wasn't all
negative. He probably made a lot of
friends...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
You think?

NAME: NED
...learned a useful trade...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Oh yes... live autopsies...

NAME: NED
...caught up on all those books he
wanted to read...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Maybe so... but he said he's going
to punch you in the testicles...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
...smash your face...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
...and decimate your wardrobe.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
And I wouldn't want that to happen.
He's a naughty naughty boy. I just
thought I should warn you.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Bye for now.
Oh... may I have a cookie?

NAME: LAURA
Sure.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Thank yooooooooou.

NAME: LAURA
Oh my God, Ned.

NAME: NED
I hate when she comes to see me.

NAME: LAURA
Don't you realize, Ned?... you could
be in real danger.

NAME: NED
What's that?

NAME: LAURA
Extreme peril. You know, the risk of
personal bodily harm.

NAME: NED
No... I mean that.

NAME: LAURA
Your insurance file. But the policy's
missing. Did you take it home?

NAME: NED
I don't think so.

NAME: LAURA
Oh, wait a second...

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Lau-raaaaa!

NAME: NED
Laura! Are you alright? That was a
very long flashback you had.

NAME: LAURA
Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a
little... pre-menstrual.

NAME: LAURA
That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped
by. She left this!

NAME: NED
Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked
me to take care of this.

NAME: LOLA
Thanks...

NAME: NED
You smoke too much.
It's hot tonight.

NAME: LOLA
Is it? I never know. My body heat
runs about twenty degrees above
normal.

NAME: NED
Maybe we should look for a cooler
place.

NAME: LOLA
I doubt we'll find one. Even the
wind chimes on my porch aren't moving
much these days. They keep thudding
softly, like dairy cows bumping butts
in the night. I go out there expecting
to find a cool breeze... but it's
just a lot of hot air.

NAME: NED
What're they lookin' at?

NAME: LOLA
A lot of them have tried that seat.
You're the first one's lasted this
long.

NAME: NED
I feel honored.

NAME: LOLA
Don't. It's broken.

NAME: NED
Did you bring the... papers?

NAME: LOLA
No. I thought you might come over...

NAME: NED
Sure. I'll drive you.

NAME: LOLA
I brought my own car.

NAME: NED
I'll follow you then.

NAME: LOLA
I know it sounds silly, but would
you leave first... wait in your car?
I come here a lot and I wouldn't
want those men to think I'm "easy"...
a slut who'll jump into bed with
anyone at the drop of a hat. But if
you leave first...

NAME: NED
...they'll think I'm a putz for
passing up a sure thing.

NAME: LOLA
Now leave me alone!

NAME: NED
Well, here we are... in the dark.

NAME: LOLA
I have The Clapper.

NAME: NED
You what?

NAME: LOLA
My wind chimes.

NAME: NED
You know, these would work a lot
better if you took them out of the
boxes.

NAME: LOLA
Well well... I guess you have been
around. I'm impressed.

NAME: NED
Why don't we take a look at those...
papers?

NAME: LOLA
Papers. Right.

NAME: NED
That's it? These are the... papers?

NAME: LOLA
Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can
you tell me what they are?

NAME: NED
This one's a laundry receipt... and
the other one's an expired lottery
ticket.

NAME: LOLA
No. You keep them... as a memento of
our time together.

NAME: LOLA
I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay
you for all you've done?

NAME: NED
Cash would be nice.

NAME: LOLA
Isn't there some other way?

NAME: NED
I suppose you could wash my car.

NAME: LOLA
No, I mean, isn't there something
else you want? Something I could
give you?

NAME: NED
Hey... slow down... there's a speed
limit in this state. Sixty-five miles
an hour.

NAME: LOLA
How fast was I going, officer?

NAME: NED
Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

NAME: LOLA
Suppose you pull me over and frisk
me?

NAME: NED
Suppose I let you off with a warning?

NAME: LOLA
Suppose I find a cop with a bigger
nightstick?

NAME: NED
Suppose I put you under arrest for
being a bad girl with bad thoughts?

NAME: LOLA
Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?

NAME: NED
Suppose I do and then we lose the
key and while I'm gone to get a
duplicate made the house catches on
fire and I can't get back to save
you because the bridge is washed out
and so you die a horrible death
toasted like a Polish sausage on a
flaming spit!
Nah... I better be going.

NAME: LOLA
You're not so tough. Last chance.

NAME: NED
No thanks. I got a cold shower and a
wife who trusts me waiting at home.

NAME: LOLA
What's the matter? Don't you want
me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

NAME: NED
Don't forget to lock up.

NAME: LOLA
I knew you'd come back...

NAME: NED
I forgot my car keys.

NAME: LOLA
That's not what you came back for.

NAME: NED
Yes it is.

NAME: LOLA
...don't... stop...

NAME: LOLA
...Oh Ned... please... don't...
stop...

NAME: LOLA
That takes care of foreplay.

NAME: GUARD
It's time, Max.

NAME: MAX SHADY
Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off
and use it for a bowling ball!

NAME: MAX SHADY
Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a
gift... to make up for losing my
case. Now I'm going to wear it to
his friggin' funeral!!

NAME: MAX SHADY
Ma!

NAME: NED
That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

NAME: LOLA
Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

NAME: NED
Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it.

NAME: LOLA
It tells the sad story of a woman
who is rejected by her lover after a
brief, but torrid, affair... so she
stalks him with an ice pick and stabs
him with it more than a thousand
times.

NAME: NED
Really? I never could understand the
lyrics.

NAME: NED
You know, what happened last night
was very, uh...

NAME: LOLA
Yes... it was. I should check on my
homeowners insurance.

NAME: NED
But we can't ever let it happen again.
Ever!

NAME: LOLA
What are you saying, Ned? That you're
rejecting me, your lover, after a
brief, but torrid, affair?!

NAME: NED
I wouldn't put it exactly like that.
It's just that... well, I'm married
to a wonderful woman... who is very,
very attractive...
...not that you aren't very
attractive!

NAME: NED
...you aren't very attractive... you
aren't very attractive... you aren't
very attractive...

NAME: CLERK
Don't touch anything. You bond with
it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

NAME: NED
I'd like to buy a pet.

NAME: CLERK
Yeah. For what purpose?

NAME: NED
It's a gift... for my wife.

NAME: CLERK
Right. They all say that.

NAME: NED
She spends a lot of time alone. I
thought it might be nice if she had
something to keep her company.

NAME: CLERK
Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know
you're not the kind of guy who punches
out parakeets? Or takes some poor
defenseless animal, throws it in a
sack and runs over it with your car
five or six times.

NAME: NED
I would never hurt an animal.

NAME: CLERK
Boy, I would. They're driving me

NAME: CLERK
Shuddup!

NAME: CLERK
Okay... tell me more about this broad
you're married to. I like to match
people with the pets they deserve.

NAME: ARCH
Uh-uh.

NAME: NED
You do all my paperwork?

NAME: NED
Get out of here.

NAME: ARCH
And a damn good job, too. One of 'em
even did it in Spanish.

NAME: ARCH
Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

NAME: ARCH
Jesus... you hear that?

NAME: NED
He's just working through his anger,
trying to find a constructive outlet.

NAME: ARCH
Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The
guy's a friggin' looney!

NAME: NED
Trust me, I spent a lot of time with
him when I was preparing his case.
He's really a very sweet, sensitive
human being.

NAME: MAX
I'd like to mash his head like a
ripe melon...

NAME: NED
He gets a little melon-dramatic.

NAME: MAX
...then cut off all his fingers and
rip out his liver with my teeth!

NAME: NED
See. Loves to exaggerate.

NAME: ARCH
Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

NAME: NED
Lieutenant Ravine.

NAME: LOLA
I want to see you, Ned.

NAME: NED
I told you not to call me! It's
finished between us. No. No, I'm not
sucking anything of yours anymore!
It's done! OVER!

NAME: NED
Wrong number.

NAME: FRANK
How come we gotta meet here?

NAME: LANA
We have to be careful now. We can't
risk being seen together at the house
or someone might connect us to the
murder later on.

NAME: LANA
Here... put this on.

NAME: LANA
Speak Yiddish.

NAME: FRANK
What?

NAME: LANA
Red Yiddish.

NAME: FRANK
Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der

There's a million

(We're going to be in
big trouble. They're
going to catch us.)

NAME: OLDER GENTLEMAN
There's very little risk involved.
Statistics reveal that less than
thirty-two percent of all murderers
are ever apprehended.

NAME: LANA
You speak Yiddish?

NAME: OLDER GENTLEMAN
No. But I can read sub-titles.

NAME: SUB-TITLE
Oy vay!

NAME: LAURA
Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

NAME: NED
I didn't. It's for my wife.

NAME: LAURA
She called. Wondered why you never
came home last night. I told her you
were working with a client,
undercover.

NAME: LAURA
Were you?

NAME: NED
What?

NAME: LAURA
There's lipstick on your collar.

NAME: NED
No there isn't.

NAME: LAURA
No... there isn't. But you answered
my question. She's a real looker,
huh?

NAME: NED
Who?

NAME: LAURA
Lola Cain.

NAME: NED
I hadn't noticed.

NAME: LAURA
Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't
noticed.
That's alright. She noticed enough
for both of us.

NAME: LAURA
I worry about you, Ned. I worry a
lot.
Max Shady's been faxing death threats
to you all morning.

NAME: NED
...stick a knife in your...
...rip the eyeballs out of your...
...drive razor-sharp spikes under
your...

NAME: LAURA
Did you get to the one...?

NAME: NED
...cut it off... shove it in a
blender.

NAME: LAURA
Yeah... that one.

NAME: NED
He's just getting it out of his
system. Once they say it... they
never do it. You know... like the
President.

NAME: LAURA
Wait. It might be him.

NAME: NED
Where did you get that?

NAME: LAURA
From my purse.

NAME: NED
What are you doing with it?

NAME: LAURA
Handing it to you.

NAME: NED
Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun
for?

NAME: LAURA
You shoot it. A bullet comes out.
Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a
cop, I'd think you'd know these
things.

NAME: NED
Laura... put the gun away.

NAME: DELIVERY MAN
Flowers for Ned Rav...
Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?
Man, you are dead meat!

NAME: LAURA
Is this another sick joke from Max
Shady?

NAME: NED
What is it...?

NAME: LAURA
Lola Cain.

NAME: LAURA
I'll put these in water for you.

NAME: LOLA'S VOICE
Ned, darling... I know this seems
like a strange way to talk with you...
but since you won't take my calls, I
have no other choice.
Watch it! That red car's turning
left!

NAME: LOLA'S VOICE
I love you, Ned. We're meant to be
together... forever.
The light's changing! Floor it! Go!
Go! Go!

NAME: LOLA'S VOICE
Nice move!
Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not
even your wife. I'd hate to have to
tell her about us, but if necessary...
I will.

NAME: LANA
What happened to you last night?

NAME: NED
Why? What have you heard?

NAME: LANA
You could have called. But then, I
suppose you were tied up.

NAME: NED
Only part of the time.

NAME: LANA
I never know when you're coming home,
Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

NAME: NED
I promise I'll spend more time with
you. I know it's been rough, being
alone so much. But I'll make it up
to you. Maybe we should try again,
you know... to have a baby.

NAME: LANA
So what's in the box?

NAME: NED
Oh... I brought you a present!

NAME: LANA
What is it?

NAME: NED
It's... sorta like a cat.

NAME: LANA
Not enough like a cat.

NAME: NED
It's a little skunk. I got it at
Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

NAME: NED
So... what're you going to name him?

NAME: LANA
How about... Ned?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've
always liked the name Ned.

NAME: LANA
No kidding.

NAME: NED
So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior
as much as you love me?

NAME: LANA
At least.

NAME: LANA
Hello?... Hello?... Hello?
Frank? Is that you?

NAME: LANA
I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!

NAME: LOLA
Who's Frank?

NAME: NED
Frank? The only Frank I know is an
auto mechanic... but I sure as hell
wouldn't recommend the guy. He's
really slow.

NAME: LOLA
I had to see you, Ned. I need to
feel your arms around me! I wanna
suck your toes til the nails pop
off!

NAME: NED
I told you, what happened was a big
mistake. A one night stand. It's
over. I have a wife...

NAME: LOLA
It doesn't matter. She'll know all
about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In
my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

NAME: LOLA
I got us tickets to see Iron
Butterfly!

NAME: NED
I hate opera!

NAME: LOLA
Why are you running from me? Didn't
it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing
my buns with carnuba wax?
Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey
want to go exploring?

NAME: NED
He's busy right now.

NAME: NED
Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a
big mistake! One lousy mistake in
his whole stinkin' life! So why don't
you give him a BREAK! Besides... he
belongs to my wife!

NAME: JUDGE ARUGULA
I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey
for setting yet another unusual legal
precedent. This is the first time
I've ever tried a case in which the
JURY was found to be insane.

NAME: BAILIFF
What're you? A thirty-eight long?

NAME: JUDGE ARUGULA
The jury will be remanded to the
Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi
Valley. Court's adjourned.

NAME: NED
Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you
tell me?

NAME: LAURA
It's not important. I just had one
last year.

NAME: NED
Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

NAME: LAURA
Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll
have another one sometime.

NAME: NED
I insist. And I want to get you a
nice present.

NAME: LAURA
You're so sweet. You don't have to.
You gave me a present last year.
Those lovely Ginzu knives.

NAME: NED
Yeah... aren't they great! They last
forever. And you can cut right through
a shoe with 'em!

NAME: NED
It's nice to be off the streets...
away from all the pain and misery
out there.

NAME: LAURA
Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind
you about...

NAME: NED
...the Legal Symposium...

NAME: LAURA
...in Santa Barbara...

NAME: NED
...tomorrow...

NAME: NED & LAURA
..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."

NAME: NED
Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

NAME: LAURA
What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

NAME: NED
I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel
passion at one time or another. Even
me.

NAME: LAURA
Really?

NAME: NED
What would you think of a married
man who gave in to those wild,
sensual, raging desires?

NAME: LAURA
Oh... wow... golly...

NAME: NED
What if, for just one crazy moment,
he couldn't resist...? He got knocked
for a loop and lost control?

NAME: LAURA
Gosh... that might be okay.

NAME: NED
What if a tidal wave of lust crashed
over him and he was sucked into a
vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

NAME: NED
Well... it's not your problem. I'll
work it out.

NAME: LOLA
Like some ice for your drink?

NAME: LOLA
Does your wife know you're...
"working" late? I certainly hope so,
Mr. Ravine.

NAME: LANA
Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

NAME: FRANK
It's all taken care of. When do I
knock on the door?

NAME: LANA
Wait until I signal you. When I raise
the blinds... you knock.

NAME: LANA
Not now!

NAME: FRANK
Oh, later... right... okay.

NAME: LANA
Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-
bye to Little Ned. He loves his
daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

NAME: NED
See you tonight, Junior.

NAME: LANA
What's wrong?

NAME: NED
This neighborhood is getting worse
all the time! Damn kids stole my
engine!

NAME: LANA
Why don't you catch the train to
Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty
minutes.

NAME: NED
I'll just fly up.

NAME: LANA
No!

NAME: LANA
I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists
seized the airport this morning. A
plane crashed into the tower... and
all the runways are on fire!

NAME: NED
Yeah. So?

NAME: LANA
And it's fogged in.

NAME: NED
Dammit.

NAME: LANA
For my peace of mind... take the
train.

NAME: NED
I can't do it. You know how I feel
about riding trains.

NAME: LANA
Darling... it's only a short trip.

NAME: NED
Yeah... right. A short trip.

NAME: NED
A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

NAME: LANA
Just because both your parents died
in a train wreck...

NAME: NED
And my brother, Jeff...

NAME: LANA
And your brother, Morty...

NAME: NED
My two sisters...

NAME: LANA
Right...

NAME: NED
My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...
Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.
All killed by trains!

NAME: LANA
Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's
the past. They're gone.

NAME: NED
Yeah. I guess I can't bring them
back by not riding on a train.

NAME: LANA
That's right.

NAME: NED
But I just can't get over this stupid
nagging fear that...

NAME: LANA
Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I
don't want to raise a child in a
home filled with fear!

NAME: LANA
But if you can conquer your fear...
maybe I can conquer my fear of having
a baby with a father who's fearful.
Ned... don't let a train kill our
child before it's even conceived!

NAME: NED
I guess you're right.

NAME: LANA
You're sure now...?

NAME: NED
But we'll never make it to the
station. By the time a cab gets
here...

NAME: FRANK
I was in the neighborhood. Thought
I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

NAME: LANA
Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

NAME: FRANK
Sure, I'll take you to the train
station.

NAME: NED
Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

NAME: NED
We're not going to make it.

NAME: FRANK
We'll make it!

NAME: LANA
Okay... now what're you going to do
if you feel queasy going through the
tunnel?

NAME: NED
I'll stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

NAME: LANA
That's right. When you get queasy...
go stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

NAME: WOMAN PASSENGER
OH! My dear gracious!

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish
that foul smelling cigar?

NAME: MAX
You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU
want me to put out my cigar? You
want ME to put out my CIGAR?

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
Yeah.

NAME: MAX
Certainly.

NAME: LANA
It's already getting to him. He'll
be out of that seat and into the
vestibule within ten minutes... I
guarantee it.

NAME: MAX
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to
ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

NAME: CONDUCTOR
Ticket?

NAME: CONDUCTOR
Sorry pal... automatic weapons are
only allowed in the club car after
nine p.m.

I'll check it with baggage. You can
claim it at the depot in Santa
Barbara.

Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on

No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?
My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really

"Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy
Gopher Guts"?

NAME: LANA
You want to earn a couple bucks,
kid?

NAME: JEFF
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?

NAME: LANA
He's losing it. You better get up to
the next car. Remember, give me the
high sign as soon as you see the
river. It'll be two minutes and nine
seconds past the tunnel. I'll take
care of the rest. Anything goes
wrong... just make sure you back me
up.
And don't let him see you.

NAME: NED
This... is not a toy!

Yes it is.

Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

NAME: LANA
Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

NAME: MAX
You shootin' at me?

NAME: MAX
Yeah... you're definitely shootin'
at me.

NAME: NED
In this crazy world, there's not a
whole lot a guy can count on. But
when the chips are down, I can always
count on you.

NAME: NED
You risked your life to save mine. A
guy can't ask any more from a woman
than that.

NAME: NED
But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In
cold blood. I gotta arrest you for
murder.

NAME: LANA
Ned... you wouldn't...

NAME: NED
Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to
do.

NAME: LANA
But... you said it yourself. I saved
your life.

NAME: NED
Don't worry, baby. I know a good
lawyer.

NAME: NED
That's a question for the arresting
officer.

NAME: NED
You'll have to ask her attorney.

NAME: NED
Only her husband can answer that.

NAME: NED
A lovely powder blue dress with a
cinch waist, full bodice and a
delicately pleated skirt.

No comment.

I said... NO COMMENT!

Jeez... they're really throwing some
tough questions out there today.

They're just doing their job.

Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech
lynching of an uppity white
housewife."

What's this?

Only cell available. They had that
serial killer locked up here... you

to death then eats them... Hannibal
the Lecturer. But they let him out
for a three week tour to publicize
his new book.

NAME: NED
"To Serve Man."

NAME: ARCH
It's a cookbook.

NAME: ARCH
And look, look... he autographed it.

NAME: NED
To Arch... Love to have you for dinner
sometime... Hannibal.
Very nice.

They're waiting for ya. They didn't
want to start without her attorney
being present.

PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could

Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

It's your collar... your bust...
your call... your show... your play...
your move... your wife...

NAME: NED
Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

NAME: INVESTIGATOR 2
Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup
allowed in this building.

What're you gonna do... arrest me
for primping?

NAME: NED
Don't give us a tough time. Just
spill it! What were you doing on
that train?

NAME: LANA
Well...

NAME: NED
As your attorney, I must advise you...
you don't have to answer that
question.

NAME: NED
Alright, quit playing games with us!
Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get
the gun? What's your link with the

Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I

badgering of my client. She'll have
her day in court, gentlemen.

gentlemen.

the lavatory of the train?

NAME: CONDUCTOR
Yes... it is.

NAME: NED
I'd like this marked as evidence.

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's
check out the re-play.

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide
open! But instead of handing it off,
Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh!
The pass is wide! A real wobbler!
There's no way! He scrambles, but he
just can't get his hands on it...
And RIGHT THERE!...
...WHAM! That blender is gone!

NAME: LAURA
Ned... did you ever consider that
maybe you don't know women as well
as you think you do?

NAME: NED
I'm really worried about this guy.
He could blow our whole case right
out of the water.

NAME: JEFF
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet...
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

NAME: JEFF
That lady paid me two bucks to sing
it to him...!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Recess! Ten minutes!

NAME: PROSECUTOR
Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha!

NAME: LAURA
No you didn't!

NAME: NED
No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!

NAME: BAILIFF
Recess is over! Let's go... move it,
move it, move it!

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
There they go... the UCLA Marching
Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it
looks like the victim's mother...
Helen Shady... is gonna take the
stand! This will be the first
defensive play of the afternoon.

NAME: NED
Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about
your son, Max. Was he a... a good
boy?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
He was the best. And that's not just
a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

NAME: NED
But he got into trouble once in
awhile... like all kids do?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes
and things. But he was so cute. I
have pictures!

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Here. This is when he set the cat on
fire...
Oh... but the cat deserved it.

NAME: NED
And what, uh... what are these...?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Marshmallows. He just loved to toast
marshmallows over a roaring cat.
Burned on the outside... all soft in
the middle.
And right here... this was taken on
the day he left the priesthood to
join the Green Berets.

NAME: NED
This is cute.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux
Klan phase. He would take the sheets
right off my bed... cut those little
holes in them. What a stitch he was!

NAME: NED
And is this Max... with all the
tools... fixing his bike?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Why that shouldn't even be in there!
It's his rotten little half-brother.
Stinkin' little pecker... he never
was any good...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi
boys. They were all so fussy and
persnickety about everything. Heil
this and heil that.
Oh look... here's Max with his
chainsaw. He loved to go to the
national park and cut down those
giant old trees. It made him feel so
patriotic. You know, if he hadn't
been such a successful criminal... I
think he would have been a lumberjack.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
But now he'll never be anything! Not
since...
...that woman, your wife, pulled the
trigger and put my little Max in his
grave!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger
in my courtroom. It's discourteous,
impolite and disrespectful.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Don't you tell me what to do with my
finger! It's been more places than
you've ever dreamed of!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Sit down!

NAME: MRS. SHADY
I'll point my finger wherever I want!

NAME: NED
Did you encounter the victim... Max
Shady... on board the train?

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
Yeah. And I told him... "this is the
NO SMOKING car! Would you please put
out your damn cigar!"

NAME: NED
And is that the cigar in your ear?

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
I believe it is.

NAME: NED
I'd like the cigar and the head of
this witness entered into evidence.

NAME: NED
The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

NAME: BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth
so help you God?

NAME: LANA
Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

NAME: NED
Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you
Lana?

NAME: LANA
No. Call me Angel Tits.

NAME: PROSECUTOR
I object!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Sustained. Counselor... you will
address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

NAME: NED
Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell
the court... what were you doing on
that train?

NAME: LANA
I saw Max Shady at the station...
saw him get on board. I knew he'd
made threats to kill you and mutilate
your reproductive organs...

NAME: LANA
...so I got on the train too... so I
could warn you.

NAME: NED
Do you want to have children?

NAME: LANA
Someday. With the right man.

NAME: NED
But you couldn't have children if
my...
...were...
...and, uh...

NAME: LANA
It would be difficult.

NAME: NED
So you followed him, knowing you had
to protect me... your husband...
your best friend... the man you
love... the future father of your
children.

NAME: LANA
Something like that.

NAME: NED
And when you saw that maniac standing
in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize
my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and
fired and fired and FIRED!

NAME: LANA
And fired and fired and fired and
fired and fired and fired and fired...

NAME: LANA
...and fired and fired and fired.

NAME: NED
The defense rests, your Honor.

NAME: NED
How can you convict a courageous
woman who risked everything to save
the life of her beloved husband? A
woman who acted boldly to stop a
demented maniac from doing THIS!...

NAME: NED
...pulverizing the private parts of
the man she loves!

NAME: NED
Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the
potential mother of my potential
child. I challenge YOU to strike a
blow for motherhood and the American
justice system! Put the "con" back
in the Constitution. Put the "ju"
back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"
back in American. And put the "dom"
back in freedom. Find this woman
INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed
happy tonight!

NAME: REPORTER
The jury's back!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
So... has the jury reached a verdict?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Yes we have, your Honor.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
How do you find the defendant... on
the count of manslaughter?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Not guilty.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
On the count of murder in the first
degree?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Not guilty.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
On the Count of Monte Cristo?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Not guilty.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Good. Then on the count of three,
let's all get the hell out of here!
One... two...

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Wait... for... it...

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Two and a half... THREE!

NAME: LANA
Well, counselor, looks like you won
another case. Lucky for me.

NAME: IRRITABLE WOMAN
I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars
is bad for your hearing!

NAME: COURT CLERK
Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

NAME: LANA
How much for my gun?

NAME: LAURA
I don't believe it! She just bought
her gun back! The gun she used to
kill a man!

NAME: NED
Yeah... the same gun that saved my
life. I'm sure it has sentimental
value.

NAME: FRANK
So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

NAME: LANA
No thanks to you.

NAME: FRANK
Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

NAME: LANA
You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You
let me take all the heat.

NAME: FRANK
Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

NAME: LANA
You were gonna let me rot in the
slammer... never say a thing.

NAME: FRANK
Look... you're out... free. Now we're
together. That's what counts. We can
try again! Forget triple indemnity.
We'll whack him and split three mil.

NAME: LANA
I'm not splitting anything, Frank.
And you know too much.

NAME: FRANK
Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot
me.

NAME: LANA
You're right.
Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

NAME: FRANK
Now you're talkin' baby.

NAME: FORENSIC MAN
Watch your step, guys. There's a lot
of blood.

NAME: INVESTIGATOR
Looks like a suicide. We found a
note.

NAME: INVESTIGATOR
It was stuck up his nose.

NAME: ARCH
"I can't take it anymore. I'm a
mediocre mechanic... and a lousy
lover."

NAME: NED
He's sure got that right.

NAME: NED
The "mechanic" part, I mean.

NAME: NED
I don't know why, Arch, but I just
can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't
suicide.

NAME: LANA
Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

NAME: NED
Um? She told you her name was Um?
And what other lies did she tell
you? I've never seen this woman in
my life! Never followed her home!
Never had sex with her in the
refrigerator! It's all a sick
fantasy... and I deny everything!

NAME: NED
When will women like you learn, you
can't tear apart a perfectly good
marriage with your vicious lies...
Miss UMMMM!

NAME: LOLA
Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.
I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.
The big powerful kind that suck up
everything in sight. I was just
telling your wife, if she wants to
get rid of all her dirt, she has to
be willing to pay the price.

NAME: LOLA
Let me know what you decide, Mrs.
Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a
convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure
meeting you... Ned.

NAME: LANA
I... hate... SALESMEN!

NAME: NED
I know it's been a tough ordeal...
with the trial and everything. Tell
you what... let's take a trip.

NAME: LANA
A trip?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Just the two of us.

NAME: LANA
I like that. Just you and me... all
alone. I'll start packing.

NAME: NED
Great. Listen... I got something to
take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

NAME: LOLA
Who is it?

NAME: NED
I just want to talk.

NAME: LOLA
Why didn't you say so?

NAME: LOLA
Would you like a drink?

NAME: NED
No thanks. I'm driving.

NAME: LOLA
Then let's get to the point!

NAME: LOLA
So what's your problem, tough guy?

NAME: NED
Stay away from my life, my wife, my
home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on
a vacation and when I come back, I
don't ever want to see your face
again!

NAME: LOLA
A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a
VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!
She always was and always will be!

NAME: NED
What are you talking about? You don't
know anything about Lana?

NAME: LOLA
I know EVERYTHING!

NAME: NED
How do you know her? Who is she to
you? TELL ME!

NAME: NED
Who is she!

NAME: LOLA
She's your wife!

NAME: NED
Who is she!?

NAME: LOLA
She's my sister!

NAME: NED
Liar! Who is she?

NAME: LOLA
She's your wife!

NAME: LOLA
She's my sister!

NAME: LOLA
She's your wife... AND my sister!

NAME: LOLA
She was spoiled rotten! She stole
everything I ever had. Everything!
Including him.

NAME: NED
Him? Who, him?

NAME: LOLA
Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He
was older. So mature... so strong.
He smelled like dirty sweat socks
and old basketballs. And he was all
mine. For awhile.
But Lana wasn't satisfied with her
own things. She had to have mine
too. She took it all... my makeup,
my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

NAME: NED
You wore the same clothes?

NAME: LOLA
We were identical twins.

NAME: NED
What're you talking about? You two
don't look anything alike.

NAME: LOLA
Not anymore. One day I caught her
stealing my lavender eye shadow and
she smashed my face in with a shovel.
I had fifty-three operations. When
the doctors were finished with me...
I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!

NAME: NED
You're beautiful.

NAME: LOLA
Don't lie to me.

NAME: NED
They did a terrific job!

NAME: LOLA
I look in the mirror. I can SEE!

NAME: NED
But... you're gorgeous!

NAME: LOLA
Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my
face, he left me for HER... because
she looked more like me than I did!
First she stole my looks... then she
stole the only man who ever loved
me!

NAME: LOLA
But I found a way to get even. The
best revenge possible. Destroy her
marriage!

NAME: NED
That's why you did all this? Seduced
me... harrassed me... the tape...
the flowers... the phone calls...

NAME: LOLA
You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,
haven't ya?

NAME: NED
It won't work. Lana loves me.

NAME: LOLA
It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing
her for everything she's worth. She
murdered that greasy auto mechanic.
I saw her do it.

NAME: NED
Lana killed Frank Kelbo?

NAME: LOLA
Kelbo! His name was Kelbo?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car
repairs too?

NAME: LOLA
Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a
son. Frankie Kelbo.

NAME: NED
Lana?

NAME: LAURA
Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so
much to tell you.

NAME: NED
Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab
a chair.

NAME: LAURA
Thanks... I brought my own.

NAME: NED
So... what have you got?

NAME: LAURA
A lottery ticket and a laundry
receipt.
I found them in the pocket of that
suit you wore the night you were
working under cover with a client.

NAME: LAURA
You remember that night, don't ya
Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts
with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
O... L-A. Lola.

NAME: LAURA
Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's
mind works.

NAME: NED
How about Ovaltine?

NAME: LAURA
Fine. Then I remembered you told me
some guy named Frank had been working
on your wife's car for two months.
You with me so far?

NAME: NED
I'm way ahead of you.

NAME: LAURA
Well back it up. You probably took a
wrong turn. Remember your insurance
policy... the one we couldn't find?
I started thinking, who else had
access to it beside you and me? The
answer came up... Lana. And since
she's a woman, it's probably hidden
right here.

NAME: NED
So that's where she hid the Oreos.

NAME: LAURA
Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your
life when she shot Max Shady. She
and Frank were plotting to kill you
and collect on your insurance policy.
But she shot the wrong guy.

NAME: NED
That's the craziest thing I ever
heard.

NAME: LAURA
Don't you see... Frank was going to
let her take the fall. So she murdered
him and tried to make it look like
suicide.
That's when I realized there was a
connection between Lola and Lana...

NAME: NED
Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

NAME: LAURA
Well, hang on to your jock strap,
Ned. There's more.

NAME: LAURA
Not only is Frank's father Dwayne
Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher
and Lola Cain's former lover...
Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max
and Frank are half-brothers who never
met.

NAME: LAURA
Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered
both of Helen Shady's sons.

NAME: NED
This is so unbelievable.

NAME: LAURA
And you haven't even heard my story.

NAME: LAURA
He turned into a monster. And that's
when I left him. I just couldn't...

NAME: NED
That damn faucet keeps turning on
all by itself. I'll go check it.

NAME: LAURA
Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

NAME: GUEST MUSICIAN
I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a
gig tonight.

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Forget something, sweetheart?

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
You forgot to flush, darling.

NAME: LOLA
What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me
away?

NAME: LAURA
I never forget anything... honey.

NAME: LAURA
Those are MY panties!

NAME: LAURA
Oh Ned!

NAME: NED
You were right... there's a million
things I don't know about women.
Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

NAME: NED
Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

NAME: LAURA
Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved
you!

NAME: LAURA
Got 'em!

NAME: NED
NAME: LAURA
I said... I GOT 'EM!

NAME: LAURA
NAME: NED
NAME: LAURA
Okay. But I want to have kids.

NAME: NED
Great.

NAME: NED
...understand women... give birth...
and program a VCR. And giving birth
is the easy one.

NAME: LAURA
Ned...

NAME: NED
Yeah, Laura?

NAME: LAURA
Knock off the chatter, will ya?

NAME: LAURA
We won't need you anymore.

NAME: LAURA
We can make our own music.
