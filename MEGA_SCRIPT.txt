NAME: ARCH
Jeez... knock off the chatter, will
ya.

NAME: NED
Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

NAME: ARCH
I'm awake! Where do you come up with
all that crap about women?

NAME: NED
It's true. Women are very complex,
but if you know how to read 'em...
they're an open book. You can always
tell the rotten apples from the
peaches.

NAME: ARCH
Are you kiddin'?

NAME: NED
I'd stake my career on it. Anybody
ever proves me wrong, I'll throw
away my badge.

NAME: ARCH
Aayyhh... women are trouble...

NAME: NED
I used to believe that too. Until I
married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.

NAME: ARCH
Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,
pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a
beautiful wife waitin' for ya at
home. Everything a guy could ever
want, including NO kids.

NAME: NED
I'd love to have kids.

NAME: ARCH
What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!
Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes
you think Milo's gonna show up here?

NAME: NED
Logic. He knocked off all those banks.
He's got cash. He's gonna want to
spend it. This is one of the few
places that still takes cash. Sooner
or later... he's gotta turn up.

NAME: ARCH
And how we s'posed to recognize this
scumbag?

NAME: NED
The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you
see him... you'll know him.

NAME: ARCH
These are the best damn Nachos in
North America. Maybe the world!

NAME: ARCH
I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.
You want some?

NAME: LOLA
Got a light?

NAME: NED
Sure.

NAME: LOLA
How about a match?

NAME: NED
No thanks. I have plenty.

NAME: LOLA
You really are incredibly stupid,
aren't you? I like that in a man.

NAME: NED
I'd be insulted, but I know you're
serious.

NAME: LOLA
You sound so sure of yourself.

NAME: NED
I'm not as dumb as I look.

NAME: LOLA
Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...

NAME: NED
Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?

NAME: LOLA
Thirsty. What about that drink?

NAME: NED
I'm on duty.

NAME: LOLA
Brain surgeon?

NAME: NED
Cop.

NAME: LOLA
Oooo... and I bet you have a big
gun.

NAME: NED
You lose.

NAME: LOLA
If I can't buy you a drink...
...let me buy you one of those.

NAME: NED
Who can say no to a weiner?

NAME: LOLA
Not me.

NAME: LOLA
Two dogs. Hot.

NAME: NED
You come here often?

NAME: LOLA
Only when I'm in heat.

NAME: NED
Oh! Sorry.

NAME: LOLA
Where ya going?

NAME: NED
Get something to wipe it off.

NAME: LOLA
That's okay. You're doing just fine.

NAME: NED
I'll get you a wet paper towel.

NAME: NED
Hold it right there, Milo!

NAME: RESTROOM PATRON
Look out! He's got a weenie!

NAME: NED
Police emergency! I need your car!

NAME: NED
You take science in high school,
Milo?

NAME: MILO
I skipped high school, cop!

NAME: NED
Then you're probably not familiar
with the theory of inverse
proportionate explosive dynamics.

NAME: MILO
What about it?

NAME: NED
If you fire a weapon with the barrel
obstructed, the explosive force
multiplies by twenty-three point
five nine eight and reverses on itself
with diametric polarity?

NAME: MILO
Yeah. So?

NAME: NED
The gun will blow up in your hand...
and it won't even scorch my pinkie.

NAME: MILO
Ha! That's just theoretical
hypothesis. Inverse proportionate
explosive dynamics has never been
demonstrated conclusively in a
laboratory environment.

NAME: NED
Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart
guy. Let's find out.

NAME: NED
You have the right to remain silent...
next... if you waive that right,
anything you say... next...

NAME: NED
...may be used against you in a court
of law... next... You have the right
to an attorney... Do you have an
attorney?

NAME: MILO
Nahhhh!

NAME: NED
Then today's your lucky day...

NAME: LANA
Not bad for an auto mechanic...

NAME: FRANK
Yeah, well you're not so bad
yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

NAME: LANA
Better watch your tongue, sweetie,
or I'll have my husband arrest you.

NAME: FRANK
Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When
does he ever find time for you?

NAME: LANA
He doesn't. That's why I need you to
keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why
drive a jalopy when you can have a
hot rod?

NAME: FRANK
Maybe you should trade him in on a
new model.

NAME: LANA
I would... if I could make any money
on the deal.

NAME: FRANK
Want to go for another test drive?

NAME: LANA
Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm
still under warranty.

NAME: NED
Morning sweetheart.

NAME: LANA
Uh huh. Want some coffee?

NAME: NED
No thanks.

NAME: LANA
Frank here was just grabbing a little
before going back to work on my car.

NAME: NED
How long you been working on Lana's
Mercedes, Frank?

NAME: FRANK
Oh... I don't know... six, seven
weeks.

NAME: NED
And ya still haven't found the
problem?

NAME: FRANK
Think I got my finger on it though.

NAME: NED
I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't
born yesterday. He's not fixing your
car. He's SCREWING you!

NAME: NED
YOU are screwing my wife! I can see
what your game is, Frank. You open
up her hood, poke around in there...
squirt some lubrication in... play
around with all her parts... then
take an old used piston and stick it
in... then pull it out... in, out,
in, out! Every day! There's no end
to it. You just keep coming and
COMING!... and the bill just gets
bigger and BIGGER!

NAME: NED
But you don't see it, do you, Lana?
You're too good... too pure. You
can't see the evil in people like
him.
Well, you're not getting away with
it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're
fired!

NAME: LANA
Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

NAME: NED
Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late
for court.

NAME: NED
You are so naive.

NAME: NED
Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

NAME: FRANK
Who's that?

NAME: LANA
Just the postman. He always rings
twice.

NAME: NED
Laura... do you know where...?

NAME: LAURA
Right here. The judge decided to
skip arraignment and take Milo direct
to trial. You're six minutes late,
but don't sweat it. You got Judge
Allen. He's always eleven minutes
late.

NAME: LAURA
I suggest you try Lemming versus
Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped
in the water and everybody followed.

NAME: NED
Yeah. Good idea.

NAME: NED
I don't know what I'd do without
you?

NAME: LAURA
Really?

NAME: NED
Laura, how long have you worked for
me?

NAME: LAURA
Two years, seven months, twenty-three
days, nineteen hours...
...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.
...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-
five... fifty-six...

NAME: NED
And when was the last time I gave
you a raise?

NAME: LAURA
Never. But that's okay. I don't need
a raise. In fact... I was thinking
of giving you a rebate on my salary.

NAME: NED
Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

NAME: NED
Laura. Laura! What is it?

NAME: LAURA
I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a
bit... claustrophobic... in the
bathroom.

NAME: NED
Maybe we should try some prune juice.

NAME: LAURA
Wear the blue one.

NAME: NED
Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...
does this look like the face of a
crook?

NAME: NED
Of course it does. But the question
of my client's guilt or innocence is
not the issue here today. I'm certain
every member of the jury can clearly
see that he's guilty!

NAME: BLIND JUROR
I can't.

NAME: NED
Put yourself in his shoes. Look
through his eyes. See the world the
way HE sees it!

NAME: NED
Things just don't look the same.
It's fuzzy... and frightening!

NAME: NED
Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley
is not the perpetrator here. He is
the VICTIM!

NAME: NED
Like ALL of us... this man is the
unfortunate victim of these tragically
difficult economic times. And what
does that mean? He can't support his
family!

NAME: NED
For God's sake!... He can't even
support his own FACE!

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum
in my courtroom... unless you have
enough for everyone.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Bailiff. Pass these out.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
And don't forget the jury.

NAME: NED
And so, desperate and broke, with no
other options before him, Mr. Crumley
went to eleven Savings & Loans and
did what any of you would have done.
He stole back the money that the
S&Ls had stolen from him!

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Mr. Ravine... please approach the
bench.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
You're not running for congress here,
so knock off the speeches and quit
inciting these brainless morons! Now
pick up the pace and wrap this son-
of-a-bitch up! Call your first
witness.

NAME: NED
I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

NAME: BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

NAME: NED
I do.

NAME: NED
Detective Ravine, at the time of the
arrest, did you read the defendant
his Miranda rights?

NAME: NED
Of course. That's standard procedure.

NAME: NED
Are these the cards Officer Brooks
used to prompt you while reading Mr.
Crumley his rights?

NAME: NED
Yeah. These are them.

NAME: NED
Reading from the cards now... quote
"You have the right to remain silent,
if you waive that right, anything
you say... may be used against you
in a court of law." Is that right?

NAME: NED
That's right.

NAME: NED
WRONG! The official Miranda warning
is... "anything you say CAN be used
against you in a court of law." Not
"may"... "CAN!"
Don't you know the difference between
"can" and "may", Detective? Every
school kid knows "can" is a verb
that indicates ability to perform,
while "may" is a verbal auxiliary
indicating the permission to act.

NAME: NED
I didn't have time to worry about
past participles or interrogative
pronouns! I was trying to protect
society from a deranged MADMAN!
But this ivy league fop...!!!

NAME: NED
I have no more use for this witness.

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
Mr. Ravine...

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
I'm dismissing this case on the
grounds of improper grammar.

NAME: NED
Ow!

NAME: PROSECUTOR
But your Honor...!

NAME: JUDGE ALLEN
I know, I know. It's a technicality.
But it's the kind of technicality
that makes the American legal system
what it is today! Court's adjourned!

NAME: LOLA
I waited. You never came back.

NAME: NED
I got busy. Here's that paper towel
I promised.

NAME: LOLA
Thanks...

NAME: NED
How'd you get in? The door was locked.

NAME: LOLA
It's miraculous what a real woman
can do... with a bobbie pin.

NAME: LOLA
Cigarette?

NAME: NED
No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

NAME: LOLA
Yes, I know. I like things that are
bad for me.
So... I hear you go both ways.

NAME: NED
Only once. It was a fraternity prank.
I never saw him again.

NAME: LOLA
No, I mean... you're a cop and a
lawyer.

NAME: NED
Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of
scum out there on the streets... but
they all deserve a fair and costly
trial.

NAME: LAURA
I'll get that.

NAME: NED
Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

NAME: LOLA
Lola Cain.

NAME: LOLA
So lovely to meet you, Laura.

NAME: NED
Gotta keep these darn books in their
right place or we'll never find the
ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...
R thru B... W thru F...

NAME: LAURA
It's getting late. I'll give you a
ride home, Ned.

NAME: NED
I have my car.

NAME: LAURA
I'll tow you.

NAME: NED
Not today. You don't need to wait.
I'll see you tomorrow.

NAME: LAURA
I should call someone to fix this...

NAME: NED
Tomorrow...

NAME: LAURA
I'll call from home.

NAME: LOLA
I think I should warn you, Mr.
Ravine... I'm not wearing any
underwear.

NAME: NED
Try these on.

NAME: NED
So... what can I do for you?

NAME: LOLA
I've run across some... papers...
and I thought you might be able to
tell me what they are. You see, I'm
not very experienced when it comes
to... papers.

NAME: NED
I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.
Do you have the... papers... here?

NAME: LOLA
No... they're at home. I thought you
might stop by...

NAME: NED
I'm on duty tonight.

NAME: LOLA
Don't they ever give you a night
off?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Tomorrow.

NAME: LOLA
Why don't we meet tomorrow evening
then?

NAME: LOLA
I'll let you know where.

NAME: NED
What's wrong with my office?

NAME: LOLA
Nothing a good interior decorator
couldn't fix.

NAME: LOLA
Take care of this for me, will ya?

NAME: FRANK
I came back for my shower cap.

NAME: LANA
Yeah, well you came to the right
place.

NAME: LANA
Sit down.

NAME: FRANK
Where is he?

NAME: LANA
On duty all night. By the time he
wraps up his reports, it'll be close
to noon tomorrow.

NAME: LANA
I was just reading over...

NAME: LANA
Take off the hat, Frank.

NAME: LANA
I was just reading over my husband's
insurance policies. You wouldn't
know anything about insurance, would
you, Frankie?

NAME: FRANK
Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies
part-time. I got half a brain... or
didn't you notice?

NAME: LANA
I musta had my eye on something else.
How about a translation.

NAME: FRANK
Standard accident policy... all the
usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The
face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three
million bucks!
And there's a triple indemnity rider.

NAME: LANA
Meaning?

NAME: FRANK
Aw, it's just something agents throw
in so we can boost the premium. If
the policy holder dies under very
specific conditions, it pays off
three times the face value of the
policy.

NAME: LANA
Nine million dollars...?

NAME: FRANK
Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the
company. Nobody ever collects.

NAME: LANA
Why not?

NAME: FRANK
Well, like here... it only pays off
if he's shot with a pistol, falls
from a moving northbound train and
drowns in a fresh water stream.

NAME: LANA
All three?

NAME: FRANK
See what I mean, sweetheart? What
are the odds of that?

NAME: LANA
It could happen.
Suppose it did happen?

NAME: FRANK
Then you'd be rich.

NAME: LANA
Then we'd be rich.

NAME: FRANK
What're you sayin'...?

NAME: LANA
We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!
And I know exactly how! He has a
legal symposium in Santa Barbara
this weekend... All we have to do is
get him to take the train up instead
of driving.

NAME: FRANK
How we gonna do that? Didn't you
tell me he hates trains?

NAME: LANA
That's where you come in, baby. You're
gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.
That should be no problem for you.

NAME: LANA
Then... we give him a lift to the
train station... through Dealey Plaza,
past the Book Suppository and around
the grassy knoll...

NAME: FRANK
Isn't that out of our way?

NAME: LANA
Move, Frank.

NAME: LANA
And pay attention.

NAME: LANA
Ten minutes out of the station he'll
be standing in the vestibule between
cars... trying to avoid a panic
attack. Fourteen minutes and ten
seconds out, the train crosses the
Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen
minutes and fifty-four seconds, I
shoot him, shove him out the door...
he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!
A triple play. We're rich!

NAME: FRANK
You been thinking about this a lot,
haven't you?

NAME: LANA
No. It just came to me.
I had this image of a big, powerful,
throbbing train... plunging into a
long, dark, wet tunnel.

NAME: NED
Stand over there and shut up!

NAME: NED
Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want
to hear language like that!

NAME: ARCH
Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.
You seem a little tense tonight.
What is it?

NAME: NED
Aw... I don't know. I guess it's
Lana. It's just... I know she wants
to have a baby so bad...

NAME: NED
...but I never get to spend any time
with her. And when I am home... it's
like she's, you know... avoiding
sex.

NAME: NED
That can't be it. I'm the tenderest
guy on the force. Nah... I think
she's just afraid she won't be able
to get pregnant.

NAME: ARCH
What's to be afraid! It's like making
breakfast! You bring home the bacon...
she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it
up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got
an omelette in the oven!
Why don't you knock off early... go
home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake
up in the morning and find you there
for a change.

NAME: NED
Naw... I can't. I got all this
paperwork.

NAME: ARCH
Don't worry about that.

NAME: OTHER GANG MEMBERS
Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

NAME: WILLARD SCOTT
...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of
Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and
thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of
female! Smokes three cigars a day,
drinks a straight shot of vodka at
bedtime... and still has sex!

NAME: NED
Damn birds!

NAME: LAURA
My God, Ned... you look like you
were hit by a bus.

NAME: NED
I was.
Who's in my office?

NAME: LAURA
Max Shady's mother.

NAME: NED
Not again.

NAME: NED
Hello, Mrs. Shady.

NAME: NED
Laura... check on my insurance. Make
sure it's paid up.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,
is getting out of prison tomorrow.

NAME: NED
Gee, has it been seven years already?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Seven long, miserable years in the
slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

NAME: NED
Well, being locked in a tiny room
with no TV can make a guy feel pretty
tense.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
I'm very concerned about him, Mr.
Ravine. He said you were a two-bit
shyster... and he's going to rip
your head off and use it for a bowling
ball!

NAME: NED
I'm sure the experience wasn't all
negative. He probably made a lot of
friends...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
You think?

NAME: NED
...learned a useful trade...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Oh yes... live autopsies...

NAME: NED
...caught up on all those books he
wanted to read...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Maybe so... but he said he's going
to punch you in the testicles...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
...smash your face...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
...and decimate your wardrobe.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
And I wouldn't want that to happen.
He's a naughty naughty boy. I just
thought I should warn you.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Bye for now.
Oh... may I have a cookie?

NAME: LAURA
Sure.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Thank yooooooooou.

NAME: LAURA
Oh my God, Ned.

NAME: NED
I hate when she comes to see me.

NAME: LAURA
Don't you realize, Ned?... you could
be in real danger.

NAME: NED
What's that?

NAME: LAURA
Extreme peril. You know, the risk of
personal bodily harm.

NAME: NED
No... I mean that.

NAME: LAURA
Your insurance file. But the policy's
missing. Did you take it home?

NAME: NED
I don't think so.

NAME: LAURA
Oh, wait a second...

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Lau-raaaaa!

NAME: NED
Laura! Are you alright? That was a
very long flashback you had.

NAME: LAURA
Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a
little... pre-menstrual.

NAME: LAURA
That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped
by. She left this!

NAME: NED
Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked
me to take care of this.

NAME: LOLA
Thanks...

NAME: NED
You smoke too much.
It's hot tonight.

NAME: LOLA
Is it? I never know. My body heat
runs about twenty degrees above
normal.

NAME: NED
Maybe we should look for a cooler
place.

NAME: LOLA
I doubt we'll find one. Even the
wind chimes on my porch aren't moving
much these days. They keep thudding
softly, like dairy cows bumping butts
in the night. I go out there expecting
to find a cool breeze... but it's
just a lot of hot air.

NAME: NED
What're they lookin' at?

NAME: LOLA
A lot of them have tried that seat.
You're the first one's lasted this
long.

NAME: NED
I feel honored.

NAME: LOLA
Don't. It's broken.

NAME: NED
Did you bring the... papers?

NAME: LOLA
No. I thought you might come over...

NAME: NED
Sure. I'll drive you.

NAME: LOLA
I brought my own car.

NAME: NED
I'll follow you then.

NAME: LOLA
I know it sounds silly, but would
you leave first... wait in your car?
I come here a lot and I wouldn't
want those men to think I'm "easy"...
a slut who'll jump into bed with
anyone at the drop of a hat. But if
you leave first...

NAME: NED
...they'll think I'm a putz for
passing up a sure thing.

NAME: LOLA
Now leave me alone!

NAME: NED
Well, here we are... in the dark.

NAME: LOLA
I have The Clapper.

NAME: NED
You what?

NAME: LOLA
My wind chimes.

NAME: NED
You know, these would work a lot
better if you took them out of the
boxes.

NAME: LOLA
Well well... I guess you have been
around. I'm impressed.

NAME: NED
Why don't we take a look at those...
papers?

NAME: LOLA
Papers. Right.

NAME: NED
That's it? These are the... papers?

NAME: LOLA
Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can
you tell me what they are?

NAME: NED
This one's a laundry receipt... and
the other one's an expired lottery
ticket.

NAME: LOLA
No. You keep them... as a memento of
our time together.

NAME: LOLA
I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay
you for all you've done?

NAME: NED
Cash would be nice.

NAME: LOLA
Isn't there some other way?

NAME: NED
I suppose you could wash my car.

NAME: LOLA
No, I mean, isn't there something
else you want? Something I could
give you?

NAME: NED
Hey... slow down... there's a speed
limit in this state. Sixty-five miles
an hour.

NAME: LOLA
How fast was I going, officer?

NAME: NED
Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

NAME: LOLA
Suppose you pull me over and frisk
me?

NAME: NED
Suppose I let you off with a warning?

NAME: LOLA
Suppose I find a cop with a bigger
nightstick?

NAME: NED
Suppose I put you under arrest for
being a bad girl with bad thoughts?

NAME: LOLA
Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?

NAME: NED
Suppose I do and then we lose the
key and while I'm gone to get a
duplicate made the house catches on
fire and I can't get back to save
you because the bridge is washed out
and so you die a horrible death
toasted like a Polish sausage on a
flaming spit!
Nah... I better be going.

NAME: LOLA
You're not so tough. Last chance.

NAME: NED
No thanks. I got a cold shower and a
wife who trusts me waiting at home.

NAME: LOLA
What's the matter? Don't you want
me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

NAME: NED
Don't forget to lock up.

NAME: LOLA
I knew you'd come back...

NAME: NED
I forgot my car keys.

NAME: LOLA
That's not what you came back for.

NAME: NED
Yes it is.

NAME: LOLA
...don't... stop...

NAME: LOLA
...Oh Ned... please... don't...
stop...

NAME: LOLA
That takes care of foreplay.

NAME: GUARD
It's time, Max.

NAME: MAX SHADY
Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off
and use it for a bowling ball!

NAME: MAX SHADY
Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a
gift... to make up for losing my
case. Now I'm going to wear it to
his friggin' funeral!!

NAME: MAX SHADY
Ma!

NAME: NED
That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

NAME: LOLA
Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

NAME: NED
Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it.

NAME: LOLA
It tells the sad story of a woman
who is rejected by her lover after a
brief, but torrid, affair... so she
stalks him with an ice pick and stabs
him with it more than a thousand
times.

NAME: NED
Really? I never could understand the
lyrics.

NAME: NED
You know, what happened last night
was very, uh...

NAME: LOLA
Yes... it was. I should check on my
homeowners insurance.

NAME: NED
But we can't ever let it happen again.
Ever!

NAME: LOLA
What are you saying, Ned? That you're
rejecting me, your lover, after a
brief, but torrid, affair?!

NAME: NED
I wouldn't put it exactly like that.
It's just that... well, I'm married
to a wonderful woman... who is very,
very attractive...
...not that you aren't very
attractive!

NAME: NED
...you aren't very attractive... you
aren't very attractive... you aren't
very attractive...

NAME: CLERK
Don't touch anything. You bond with
it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

NAME: NED
I'd like to buy a pet.

NAME: CLERK
Yeah. For what purpose?

NAME: NED
It's a gift... for my wife.

NAME: CLERK
Right. They all say that.

NAME: NED
She spends a lot of time alone. I
thought it might be nice if she had
something to keep her company.

NAME: CLERK
Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know
you're not the kind of guy who punches
out parakeets? Or takes some poor
defenseless animal, throws it in a
sack and runs over it with your car

NAME: NED
I would never hurt an animal.

NAME: CLERK
Boy, I would. They're driving me

NAME: CLERK
Shuddup!

NAME: CLERK
Okay... tell me more about this broad
you're married to. I like to match
people with the pets they deserve.

NAME: ARCH
Uh-uh.

NAME: NED
You do all my paperwork?

NAME: NED
Get out of here.

NAME: ARCH
And a damn good job, too. One of 'em
even did it in Spanish.

NAME: ARCH
Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

NAME: ARCH
Jesus... you hear that?

NAME: NED
He's just working through his anger,
trying to find a constructive outlet.

NAME: ARCH
Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The
guy's a friggin' looney!

NAME: NED
Trust me, I spent a lot of time with
him when I was preparing his case.
He's really a very sweet, sensitive
human being.

NAME: MAX
I'd like to mash his head like a
ripe melon...

NAME: NED
He gets a little melon-dramatic.

NAME: MAX
...then cut off all his fingers and
rip out his liver with my teeth!

NAME: NED
See. Loves to exaggerate.

NAME: ARCH
Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

NAME: NED
Lieutenant Ravine.

NAME: LOLA
I want to see you, Ned.

NAME: NED
I told you not to call me! It's
finished between us. No. No, I'm not
sucking anything of yours anymore!
It's done! OVER!

NAME: NED
Wrong number.

NAME: FRANK
How come we gotta meet here?

NAME: LANA
We have to be careful now. We can't
risk being seen together at the house
or someone might connect us to the
murder later on.

NAME: LANA
Here... put this on.

NAME: LANA
Speak Yiddish.

NAME: FRANK
What?

NAME: LANA
Red Yiddish.

NAME: FRANK
Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der

(Yeah, but we gotta
get him on the train,
shoot him... then
push him in the river.
There's a million
ways we can screw
up.)

NAME: LANA

(We're going to be in
big trouble. They're
going to catch us.)

NAME: OLDER GENTLEMAN
There's very little risk involved.
Statistics reveal that less than
thirty-two percent of all murderers
are ever apprehended.

NAME: LANA
You speak Yiddish?

NAME: OLDER GENTLEMAN
No. But I can read sub-titles.

NAME: SUB-TITLE
Oy vay!

NAME: LAURA
Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

NAME: NED
I didn't. It's for my wife.

NAME: LAURA
She called. Wondered why you never
came home last night. I told her you
were working with a client,
undercover.

NAME: LAURA
Were you?

NAME: NED
What?

NAME: LAURA
There's lipstick on your collar.

NAME: NED
No there isn't.

NAME: LAURA
No... there isn't. But you answered
my question. She's a real looker,
huh?

NAME: NED
Who?

NAME: LAURA
Lola Cain.

NAME: NED
I hadn't noticed.

NAME: LAURA
Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't
noticed.
That's alright. She noticed enough
for both of us.

NAME: LAURA
I worry about you, Ned. I worry a
lot.
Max Shady's been faxing death threats
to you all morning.

NAME: NED
...stick a knife in your...
...rip the eyeballs out of your...
...drive razor-sharp spikes under
your...

NAME: LAURA
Did you get to the one...?

NAME: NED
...cut it off... shove it in a
blender.

NAME: LAURA
Yeah... that one.

NAME: NED
He's just getting it out of his
system. Once they say it... they
never do it. You know... like the
President.

NAME: LAURA
Wait. It might be him.

NAME: NED
Where did you get that?

NAME: LAURA
From my purse.

NAME: NED
What are you doing with it?

NAME: LAURA
Handing it to you.

NAME: NED
Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun
for?

NAME: LAURA
You shoot it. A bullet comes out.
Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a
cop, I'd think you'd know these
things.

NAME: NED
Laura... put the gun away.

NAME: DELIVERY MAN
Flowers for Ned Rav...
Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?
Man, you are dead meat!

NAME: LAURA
Is this another sick joke from Max
Shady?

NAME: NED
What is it...?

NAME: LAURA
Lola Cain.

NAME: LAURA
I'll put these in water for you.

NAME: LOLA'S VOICE
Ned, darling... I know this seems
like a strange way to talk with you...
but since you won't take my calls, I
have no other choice.
Watch it! That red car's turning
left!

NAME: LOLA'S VOICE
I love you, Ned. We're meant to be
together... forever.
The light's changing! Floor it! Go!
Go! Go!

NAME: LOLA'S VOICE
Nice move!
Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not
even your wife. I'd hate to have to
tell her about us, but if necessary...
I will.

NAME: LANA
What happened to you last night?

NAME: NED
Why? What have you heard?

NAME: LANA
You could have called. But then, I
suppose you were tied up.

NAME: NED
Only part of the time.

NAME: LANA
I never know when you're coming home,
Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

NAME: NED
I promise I'll spend more time with
you. I know it's been rough, being
alone so much. But I'll make it up
to you. Maybe we should try again,
you know... to have a baby.

NAME: LANA
So what's in the box?

NAME: NED
Oh... I brought you a present!

NAME: LANA
What is it?

NAME: NED
It's... sorta like a cat.

NAME: LANA
Not enough like a cat.

NAME: NED
It's a little skunk. I got it at
Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

NAME: NED
So... what're you going to name him?

NAME: LANA
How about... Ned?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've
always liked the name Ned.

NAME: LANA
No kidding.

NAME: NED
So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior
as much as you love me?

NAME: LANA
At least.

NAME: LANA
Hello?... Hello?... Hello?
Frank? Is that you?

NAME: LANA
I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!

NAME: LOLA
Who's Frank?

NAME: NED
Frank? The only Frank I know is an
auto mechanic... but I sure as hell
wouldn't recommend the guy. He's
really slow.

NAME: LOLA
I had to see you, Ned. I need to
feel your arms around me! I wanna
suck your toes til the nails pop
off!

NAME: NED
I told you, what happened was a big
mistake. A one night stand. It's
over. I have a wife...

NAME: LOLA
It doesn't matter. She'll know all
about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In
my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

NAME: LOLA
I got us tickets to see Iron
Butterfly!

NAME: NED
I hate opera!

NAME: LOLA
Why are you running from me? Didn't
it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing
my buns with carnuba wax?
Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey
want to go exploring?

NAME: NED
He's busy right now.

NAME: NED
Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a
big mistake! One lousy mistake in
his whole stinkin' life! So why don't
you give him a BREAK! Besides... he
belongs to my wife!

NAME: JUDGE ARUGULA
I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey
for setting yet another unusual legal
precedent. This is the first time
I've ever tried a case in which the
JURY was found to be insane.

NAME: BAILIFF
What're you? A thirty-eight long?

NAME: JUDGE ARUGULA
The jury will be remanded to the
Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi
Valley. Court's adjourned.

NAME: NED
Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you
tell me?

NAME: LAURA
It's not important. I just had one
last year.

NAME: NED
Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

NAME: LAURA
Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll
have another one sometime.

NAME: NED
I insist. And I want to get you a
nice present.

NAME: LAURA
You're so sweet. You don't have to.
You gave me a present last year.
Those lovely Ginzu knives.

NAME: NED
Yeah... aren't they great! They last
forever. And you can cut right through
a shoe with 'em!

NAME: NED
It's nice to be off the streets...
away from all the pain and misery
out there.

NAME: LAURA
Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind
you about...

NAME: NED
...the Legal Symposium...

NAME: LAURA
...in Santa Barbara...

NAME: NED
...tomorrow...

NAME: NED & LAURA
..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."

NAME: NED
Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

NAME: LAURA
What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

NAME: NED
I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel
passion at one time or another. Even
me.

NAME: LAURA
Really?

NAME: NED
What would you think of a married
man who gave in to those wild,
sensual, raging desires?

NAME: LAURA
Oh... wow... golly...

NAME: NED
What if, for just one crazy moment,
he couldn't resist...? He got knocked
for a loop and lost control?

NAME: LAURA
Gosh... that might be okay.

NAME: NED
What if a tidal wave of lust crashed
over him and he was sucked into a
vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

NAME: NED
Well... it's not your problem. I'll
work it out.

NAME: LOLA
Like some ice for your drink?

NAME: LOLA
Does your wife know you're...
"working" late? I certainly hope so,
Mr. Ravine.

NAME: LANA
Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

NAME: FRANK
It's all taken care of. When do I
knock on the door?

NAME: LANA
Wait until I signal you. When I raise
the blinds... you knock.

NAME: LANA
Not now!

NAME: FRANK
Oh, later... right... okay.

NAME: LANA
Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-
bye to Little Ned. He loves his
daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

NAME: NED
See you tonight, Junior.

NAME: LANA
What's wrong?

NAME: NED
This neighborhood is getting worse
all the time! Damn kids stole my
engine!

NAME: LANA
Why don't you catch the train to
Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty
minutes.

NAME: NED
I'll just fly up.

NAME: LANA
No!

NAME: LANA
I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists
seized the airport this morning. A
plane crashed into the tower... and
all the runways are on fire!

NAME: NED
Yeah. So?

NAME: LANA
And it's fogged in.

NAME: NED
Dammit.

NAME: LANA
For my peace of mind... take the
train.

NAME: NED
I can't do it. You know how I feel
about riding trains.

NAME: LANA
Darling... it's only a short trip.

NAME: NED
Yeah... right. A short trip.

NAME: NED
A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

NAME: LANA
Just because both your parents died
in a train wreck...

NAME: NED
And my brother, Jeff...

NAME: LANA
And your brother, Morty...

NAME: NED
My two sisters...

NAME: LANA
Right...

NAME: NED
My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...
Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.
All killed by trains!

NAME: LANA
Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's
the past. They're gone.

NAME: NED
Yeah. I guess I can't bring them
back by not riding on a train.

NAME: LANA
That's right.

NAME: NED
But I just can't get over this stupid
nagging fear that...

NAME: LANA
Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I
don't want to raise a child in a
home filled with fear!

NAME: LANA
But if you can conquer your fear...
maybe I can conquer my fear of having
a baby with a father who's fearful.
Ned... don't let a train kill our
child before it's even conceived!

NAME: NED
I guess you're right.

NAME: LANA
You're sure now...?

NAME: NED
But we'll never make it to the
station. By the time a cab gets
here...

NAME: FRANK
I was in the neighborhood. Thought
I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

NAME: LANA
Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

NAME: FRANK
Sure, I'll take you to the train
station.

NAME: NED
Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

NAME: NED
We're not going to make it.

NAME: FRANK
We'll make it!

NAME: LANA
Okay... now what're you going to do
if you feel queasy going through the
tunnel?

NAME: NED
I'll stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

NAME: LANA
That's right. When you get queasy...
go stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

NAME: WOMAN PASSENGER
OH! My dear gracious!

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish
that foul smelling cigar?

NAME: MAX
You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU
want me to put out my cigar? You
want ME to put out my CIGAR?

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
Yeah.

NAME: MAX
Certainly.

NAME: LANA
It's already getting to him. He'll
be out of that seat and into the
vestibule within ten minutes... I
guarantee it.

NAME: MAX
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to
ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

NAME: CONDUCTOR
Ticket?

NAME: CONDUCTOR
Sorry pal... automatic weapons are
only allowed in the club car after
nine p.m.

NAME: CONDUCTOR
I'll check it with baggage. You can
claim it at the depot in Santa
Barbara.

NAME: JEFF
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?
No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?
My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really
neat. Everybody gets creamed! All
bloody guts... heads ripped off and
stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song
"Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy
Gopher Guts"?

NAME: LANA
You want to earn a couple bucks,
kid?

NAME: JEFF
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?

NAME: LANA
He's losing it. You better get up to
the next car. Remember, give me the
high sign as soon as you see the
river. It'll be two minutes and nine
seconds past the tunnel. I'll take
care of the rest. Anything goes
wrong... just make sure you back me
up.
And don't let him see you.

NAME: NED
This... is not a toy!

NAME: JEFF
Yes it is.

NAME: MAX
Here... let me help you with that.

NAME: OLD WOMAN
What a nice young man. You are so
polite.

NAME: MAX
I try to be.

Great green gobs of greasy, grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... chopped up dirty birdie's
feet... one pint jar of all-purpose
porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan
stew.

a pot...

NAME: JEFF
Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

NAME: LANA
Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

NAME: MAX
You shootin' at me?

NAME: MAX
Yeah... you're definitely shootin'
at me.

NAME: NED
In this crazy world, there's not a
whole lot a guy can count on. But
when the chips are down, I can always
count on you.

NAME: NED
You risked your life to save mine. A
guy can't ask any more from a woman
than that.

NAME: NED
But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In
cold blood. I gotta arrest you for
murder.

NAME: LANA
Ned... you wouldn't...

NAME: NED
Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to
do.

NAME: LANA
But... you said it yourself. I saved
your life.

NAME: NED
Don't worry, baby. I know a good
lawyer.

NAME: NED
That's a question for the arresting
officer.

NAME: NED
You'll have to ask her attorney.

NAME: NED
Only her husband can answer that.

NAME: NED
A lovely powder blue dress with a
cinch waist, full bodice and a
delicately pleated skirt.

NAME: NED
No comment.

NAME: NED
I said... NO COMMENT!

NAME: NED
Jeez... they're really throwing some
tough questions out there today.

NAME: LAURA
They're just doing their job.

NAME: NED
Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech
lynching of an uppity white
housewife."

NAME: NED
What's this?

NAME: ARCH
Only cell available. They had that
serial killer locked up here... you
know, the one who talks his victims
to death then eats them... Hannibal
the Lecturer. But they let him out
for a three week tour to publicize
his new book.

NAME: NED
"To Serve Man."

NAME: ARCH
It's a cookbook.

NAME: ARCH
And look, look... he autographed it.

NAME: NED
To Arch... Love to have you for dinner
sometime... Hannibal.
Very nice.

NAME: ARCH
They're waiting for ya. They didn't
want to start without her attorney
being present.

NAME: LANA
PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could
use a good exterminator.

NAME: LANA
Can't you get me out of this cage,
Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.

NAME: NED
Judge said no bail. Don't worry.
Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

NAME: NED
Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

NAME: INVESTIGATOR 1
It's your collar... your bust...
your call... your show... your play...
your move... your wife...

NAME: NED
Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

NAME: INVESTIGATOR 2
Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup
allowed in this building.

NAME: LANA
What're you gonna do... arrest me
for primping?

NAME: NED
Don't give us a tough time. Just
spill it! What were you doing on
that train?

NAME: LANA
Well...

NAME: NED
As your attorney, I must advise you...
you don't have to answer that
question.

NAME: NED
Alright, quit playing games with us!
Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get
the gun? What's your link with the

NAME: NED
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I
will not tolerate this unwarranted
badgering of my client. She'll have
her day in court, gentlemen.

NAME: NED
I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine,
for being so cooperative with these
gentlemen.
Did you get all that down, Laura.
Every word she said?

NAME: LAURA
Yep. Both of 'em.

NAME: LOLA
Yes.

Out of my neighborhood! Out of my

NAME: COMMENTATOR
Once again, Americans are making a
mockery of their courts, turning a
murder trial into a media circus!
How can justice ever prevail when it
is ridiculed and reviled in such a
heinously revolting manner? This is
Clement Von Franckenstein returning
you to our BBC studios in London for
the latest photographs of Lady Di
naked in the bath.

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
What a great day for a trial! We
have lots of incandescent lighting,
seventy-two degrees inside... and no
wind!

NAME: BAILIFF
Oy vay! Oy vay! Superior Court of
Los Angeles is now in session. And
here he is... direct from a triumphant
one-week engagement in Las Vegas
Circuit Court... the honorable...

irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan-
kyyyyyyy!

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
Wow... has this defense team been
HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories
this year! Let's go down for the
coin toss.

NAME: PROSECUTOR
...the prosecution will prove that
this repulsive and degenerate woman
coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding
citizen...

NAME: NED
Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay,
irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca-
doody poo-poo...

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Sustained.

NAME: NED
And can you tell us what this is?

NAME: LAURA
Yes. It's a death threat that Max
Shady FAXED to you on the day he was
released from prison.

NAME: NED
A FAX in which he threatened to puree
certain parts of my anatomy in a
blender! I'd like to submit this
into evidence.

NAME: PROSECUTOR
Objection! Who cares about the FAX
in this case?

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
I'll allow it.

NAME: CHEERLEADERS
U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!
You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-
M-A! How you think you got that way?
Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!

NAME: NED
And is this the blender you found in
the lavatory of the train?

NAME: CONDUCTOR
Yes... it is.

NAME: NED
I'd like this marked as evidence.

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's
check out the re-play.

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide
open! But instead of handing it off,
Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh!
The pass is wide! A real wobbler!
There's no way! He scrambles, but he
just can't get his hands on it...
And RIGHT THERE!...
...WHAM! That blender is gone!

NAME: LAURA
Ned... did you ever consider that
maybe you don't know women as well
as you think you do?

NAME: NED
I'm really worried about this guy.
He could blow our whole case right
out of the water.

NAME: JEFF
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet...
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

NAME: SPORTSCASTER
There they go... the UCLA Marching
Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it
looks like the victim's mother...
Helen Shady... is gonna take the
stand! This will be the first
defensive play of the afternoon.

NAME: NED
Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about
your son, Max. Was he a... a good
boy?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
He was the best. And that's not just
a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

NAME: NED
But he got into trouble once in
awhile... like all kids do?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes
and things. But he was so cute. I
have pictures!

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Here. This is when he set the cat on
fire...
Oh... but the cat deserved it.

NAME: NED
And what, uh... what are these...?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Marshmallows. He just loved to toast
marshmallows over a roaring cat.
Burned on the outside... all soft in
the middle.
And right here... this was taken on
the day he left the priesthood to
join the Green Berets.

NAME: NED
This is cute.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux
Klan phase. He would take the sheets
right off my bed... cut those little
holes in them. What a stitch he was!

NAME: NED
And is this Max... with all the
tools... fixing his bike?

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Why that shouldn't even be in there!
It's his rotten little half-brother.
Stinkin' little pecker... he never
was any good...

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi
boys. They were all so fussy and
persnickety about everything. Heil
this and heil that.
Oh look... here's Max with his
chainsaw. He loved to go to the
national park and cut down those
giant old trees. It made him feel so
patriotic. You know, if he hadn't
been such a successful criminal... I
think he would have been a lumberjack.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
But now he'll never be anything! Not
since...
...that woman, your wife, pulled the
trigger and put my little Max in his
grave!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger
in my courtroom. It's discourteous,
impolite and disrespectful.

NAME: MRS. SHADY
Don't you tell me what to do with my
finger! It's been more places than
you've ever dreamed of!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Sit down!

NAME: MRS. SHADY
I'll point my finger wherever I want!

NAME: NED
Did you encounter the victim... Max
Shady... on board the train?

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
Yeah. And I told him... "this is the
NO SMOKING car! Would you please put
out your damn cigar!"

NAME: NED
And is that the cigar in your ear?

NAME: IRRITABLE MAN
I believe it is.

NAME: NED
I'd like the cigar and the head of
this witness entered into evidence.

NAME: NED
The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

NAME: BAILIFF
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth
so help you God?

NAME: LANA
Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

NAME: NED
Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you
Lana?

NAME: LANA
No. Call me Angel Tits.

NAME: PROSECUTOR
I object!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Sustained. Counselor... you will
address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

NAME: NED
Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell
the court... what were you doing on
that train?

NAME: LANA
I saw Max Shady at the station...
saw him get on board. I knew he'd
made threats to kill you and mutilate
your reproductive organs...

NAME: LANA
...so I got on the train too... so I
could warn you.

NAME: NED
Do you want to have children?

NAME: LANA
Someday. With the right man.

NAME: NED
But you couldn't have children if
my...
...were...
...and, uh...

NAME: LANA
It would be difficult.

NAME: NED
So you followed him, knowing you had
to protect me... your husband...
your best friend... the man you
love... the future father of your
children.

NAME: LANA
Something like that.

NAME: NED
And when you saw that maniac standing
in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize
my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and
fired and fired and FIRED!

NAME: LANA
And fired and fired and fired and
fired and fired and fired and fired...

NAME: LANA
...and fired and fired and fired.

NAME: NED
The defense rests, your Honor.

NAME: NED
How can you convict a courageous
woman who risked everything to save
the life of her beloved husband? A
woman who acted boldly to stop a
demented maniac from doing THIS!...

NAME: NED
...pulverizing the private parts of
the man she loves!

NAME: NED
Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the
potential mother of my potential
child. I challenge YOU to strike a
blow for motherhood and the American
justice system! Put the "con" back
in the Constitution. Put the "ju"
back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"
back in American. And put the "dom"
back in freedom. Find this woman
INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed
happy tonight!

NAME: REPORTER
The jury's back!

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
So... has the jury reached a verdict?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Yes we have, your Honor.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
How do you find the defendant... on
the count of manslaughter?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Not guilty.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
On the count of murder in the first
degree?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Not guilty.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
On the Count of Monte Cristo?

NAME: JURY FOREMAN
Not guilty.

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Good. Then on the count of three,
let's all get the hell out of here!
One... two...

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Wait... for... it...

NAME: JUDGE SKANKY
Two and a half... THREE!

NAME: LANA
Well, counselor, looks like you won
another case. Lucky for me.

NAME: IRRITABLE WOMAN
I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars
is bad for your hearing!

NAME: COURT CLERK
Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

NAME: LANA
How much for my gun?

NAME: LAURA
I don't believe it! She just bought
her gun back! The gun she used to
kill a man!

NAME: NED
Yeah... the same gun that saved my
life. I'm sure it has sentimental
value.

NAME: FRANK
So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

NAME: LANA
No thanks to you.

NAME: FRANK
Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

NAME: LANA
You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You
let me take all the heat.

NAME: FRANK
Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

NAME: LANA
You were gonna let me rot in the
slammer... never say a thing.

NAME: FRANK
Look... you're out... free. Now we're
together. That's what counts. We can
try again! Forget triple indemnity.
We'll whack him and split three mil.

NAME: LANA
I'm not splitting anything, Frank.
And you know too much.

NAME: FRANK
Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot
me.

NAME: LANA
You're right.
Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

NAME: FRANK
Now you're talkin' baby.

NAME: FORENSIC MAN
Watch your step, guys. There's a lot
of blood.

NAME: INVESTIGATOR
Looks like a suicide. We found a
note.

NAME: INVESTIGATOR
It was stuck up his nose.

NAME: ARCH
"I can't take it anymore. I'm a
mediocre mechanic... and a lousy
lover."

NAME: NED
He's sure got that right.

NAME: NED
The "mechanic" part, I mean.

NAME: NED
I don't know why, Arch, but I just
can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't
suicide.

NAME: LANA
Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

NAME: NED
Um? She told you her name was Um?
And what other lies did she tell
you? I've never seen this woman in
my life! Never followed her home!
Never had sex with her in the
refrigerator! It's all a sick
fantasy... and I deny everything!

NAME: NED
When will women like you learn, you
can't tear apart a perfectly good
marriage with your vicious lies...
Miss UMMMM!

NAME: LOLA
Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.
I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.
The big powerful kind that suck up
everything in sight. I was just
telling your wife, if she wants to
get rid of all her dirt, she has to
be willing to pay the price.

NAME: LOLA
Let me know what you decide, Mrs.
Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a
convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure
meeting you... Ned.

NAME: LANA
I... hate... SALESMEN!

NAME: NED
I know it's been a tough ordeal...
with the trial and everything. Tell
you what... let's take a trip.

NAME: LANA
A trip?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Just the two of us.

NAME: LANA
I like that. Just you and me... all
alone. I'll start packing.

NAME: NED
Great. Listen... I got something to
take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

NAME: LOLA
Who is it?

NAME: NED
I just want to talk.

NAME: LOLA
Why didn't you say so?

NAME: LOLA
Would you like a drink?

NAME: NED
No thanks. I'm driving.

NAME: LOLA
Then let's get to the point!

NAME: LOLA
So what's your problem, tough guy?

NAME: NED
Stay away from my life, my wife, my
home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on
a vacation and when I come back, I
don't ever want to see your face
again!

NAME: LOLA
A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a
VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!
She always was and always will be!

NAME: NED
What are you talking about? You don't
know anything about Lana?

NAME: LOLA
I know EVERYTHING!

NAME: NED
How do you know her? Who is she to
you? TELL ME!

NAME: NED
Who is she!

NAME: LOLA
She's your wife!

NAME: NED
Who is she!?

NAME: LOLA
She's my sister!

NAME: NED
Liar! Who is she?

NAME: LOLA
She's your wife!

NAME: LOLA
She's my sister!

NAME: LOLA
She's your wife... AND my sister!

NAME: LOLA
She was spoiled rotten! She stole
everything I ever had. Everything!
Including him.

NAME: NED
Him? Who, him?

NAME: LOLA
Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He
was older. So mature... so strong.
He smelled like dirty sweat socks
and old basketballs. And he was all
mine. For awhile.
But Lana wasn't satisfied with her
own things. She had to have mine
too. She took it all... my makeup,
my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

NAME: NED
You wore the same clothes?

NAME: LOLA
We were identical twins.

NAME: NED
What're you talking about? You two
don't look anything alike.

NAME: LOLA
Not anymore. One day I caught her
stealing my lavender eye shadow and
she smashed my face in with a shovel.
I had fifty-three operations. When
the doctors were finished with me...
I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!

NAME: NED
You're beautiful.

NAME: LOLA
Don't lie to me.

NAME: NED
They did a terrific job!

NAME: LOLA
I look in the mirror. I can SEE!

NAME: NED
But... you're gorgeous!

NAME: LOLA
Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my
face, he left me for HER... because
she looked more like me than I did!
First she stole my looks... then she
stole the only man who ever loved
me!

NAME: LOLA
But I found a way to get even. The
best revenge possible. Destroy her
marriage!

NAME: NED
That's why you did all this? Seduced
me... harrassed me... the tape...
the flowers... the phone calls...

NAME: LOLA
You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,
haven't ya?

NAME: NED
It won't work. Lana loves me.

NAME: LOLA
It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing
her for everything she's worth. She
murdered that greasy auto mechanic.
I saw her do it.

NAME: NED
Lana killed Frank Kelbo?

NAME: LOLA
Kelbo! His name was Kelbo?

NAME: NED
Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car
repairs too?

NAME: LOLA
Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a
son. Frankie Kelbo.

NAME: NED
Lana?

NAME: LAURA
Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so
much to tell you.

NAME: NED
Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab
a chair.

NAME: LAURA
Thanks... I brought my own.

NAME: NED
So... what have you got?

NAME: LAURA
A lottery ticket and a laundry
receipt.
I found them in the pocket of that
suit you wore the night you were
working under cover with a client.

NAME: LAURA
You remember that night, don't ya
Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts
with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
O... L-A. Lola.

NAME: LAURA
Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's
mind works.

NAME: NED
How about Ovaltine?

NAME: LAURA
Fine. Then I remembered you told me
some guy named Frank had been working
on your wife's car for two months.
You with me so far?

NAME: NED
I'm way ahead of you.

NAME: LAURA
Well back it up. You probably took a
wrong turn. Remember your insurance
policy... the one we couldn't find?
I started thinking, who else had
access to it beside you and me? The
answer came up... Lana. And since
she's a woman, it's probably hidden
right here.

NAME: NED
So that's where she hid the Oreos.

NAME: LAURA
Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your
life when she shot Max Shady. She
and Frank were plotting to kill you
and collect on your insurance policy.
But she shot the wrong guy.

NAME: NED
That's the craziest thing I ever
heard.

NAME: LAURA
Don't you see... Frank was going to
let her take the fall. So she murdered
him and tried to make it look like
suicide.
That's when I realized there was a
connection between Lola and Lana...

NAME: NED
Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

NAME: LAURA
Well, hang on to your jock strap,
Ned. There's more.

NAME: LAURA
Not only is Frank's father Dwayne
Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher
and Lola Cain's former lover...
Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max
and Frank are half-brothers who never
met.

NAME: LAURA
Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered
both of Helen Shady's sons.

NAME: NED
This is so unbelievable.

NAME: LAURA
And you haven't even heard my story.

NAME: LAURA
He turned into a monster. And that's
when I left him. I just couldn't...

NAME: NED
That damn faucet keeps turning on
all by itself. I'll go check it.

NAME: LAURA
Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

NAME: GUEST MUSICIAN
I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a
gig tonight.

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
Forget something, sweetheart?

NAME: LAURA'S HUSBAND
You forgot to flush, darling.

NAME: LOLA
What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me
away?

NAME: LAURA
I never forget anything... honey.

NAME: LAURA
Those are MY panties!

NAME: LAURA
Oh Ned!

NAME: NED
You were right... there's a million
things I don't know about women.
Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

NAME: NED
Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

NAME: LAURA
Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved
you!

NAME: LAURA
Got 'em!

NAME: NED
NAME: LAURA
I said... I GOT 'EM!

NAME: LAURA
NAME: NED
NAME: LAURA
Okay. But I want to have kids.

NAME: NED
Great.

NAME: NED
...understand women... give birth...
and program a VCR. And giving birth
is the easy one.

NAME: LAURA
Ned...

NAME: NED
Yeah, Laura?

NAME: LAURA
Knock off the chatter, will ya?

NAME: LAURA
We won't need you anymore.

NAME: LAURA
We can make our own music.
