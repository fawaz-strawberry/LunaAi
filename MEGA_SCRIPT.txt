Person_1
Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,
old buddy, do you read me?

Person_2
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

Person_1
Well, I finished my circle.  I
don't pick up any life readings.

Person_2
There isn't enough life on this
ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed, I'm going
back.

Person_1
Right.  I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.  I want to check
it out.  It won't take long.

Person_1
Hey, steady girl.  What's the
matter?  You smell something?

Person_1
Aaargh!

Person_2
Chewie!

Person_2
All right, don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back and give you
a hand.

Person_3
Solo?

Person_2
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll
know if anything comes around.

Person_3
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

Person_2
No.  He's checking out a meteorite
that hit near him.

Person_3
(indicates radar
screen)
With all the meteor activity in this
system, it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

Person_2
General, I've got to leave.  I
can't stay anymore.

Person_3
I'm sorry to hear that.

Person_2
Well, there's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
I'm a dead man.

Person_3
A death mark's not an easy thing
to live with.  You're a good
fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

Person_2
Thank you, General.

Person_2
Well, Your Highness, I guess this
is it.

Person_4
That's right.

Person_2
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

Person_4
Han!

Person_2
Yes, Your Highnessness?

Person_4
I thought you decided to stay.

Person_2
Well, the bounty hunter we ran
into on Ord Mantell changed my
mind.

Person_4
Han, we need you!

Person_2
We?

Person_4
Yes.

Person_2
Oh, what about you need?

Person_4
I need?  I don't know what you're
talking about.

Person_2
(shakes his head,
fed up)
You probably don't.

Person_4
And what precisely am I supposed
to know?

Person_2
Come on!  You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about
me.

Person_4
Yes.  You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader...

Person_2
No!  That's not it.  Come on.
Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Person_4
You're imagining things.

Person_2
Am I?  Then why are you following
me?  Afraid I was going to leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

Person_4
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

Person_2
I can arrange that.  You could use
a good kiss!

Person_5
Don't try to blame me.  I didn't
ask you to turn on the thermal
heater.  I merely commented that it
was freezing in the princess'
chamber.  But it's supposed to be
freezing.  How are we going to dry
out all her clothes?  I really don't
know.

Person_5
Oh, switch off.

Person_2
Why do you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here
and you pull both of these.

Person_5
Excuse me, sir.

Person_2
Put them back together right now.

Person_5
Might I have a word with you,
please?

Person_2
What do you want?

Person_5
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
She's been trying to get you on
the communicator.

Person_2
I turned it off.  I don't want to
talk to her.

Person_5
Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.  He hasn't come
back yet.  She doesn't know where he
is.

Person_2
I don't know where he is.

Person_5
Nobody knows where he is.

Person_2
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Person_5
Well, uh, you see...

Person_2
Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

Person_5
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Person_6
Yes, sir?

Person_2
Do you know where Commander
Skywalker is?

Person_6
I haven't seen him.  It's possible
he came in through the south entrance.

Person_2
It's possible?  Why don't you go
find out?  It's getting dark out there.

Person_6
Yes, sir.

Person_5
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire
what's going on?

Person_2
Why not?

Person_5
Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,
let's find Princess Leia.  Between
ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

Person_6
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
come in through the south entrance.
He might have forgotten to check in.

Person_2
Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

Person_6
Not yet.  We're having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.

Person_2
Then we'll have to go out on
Tauntauns.

Person_6
Sir, the temperature's dropping too
rapidly.

Person_2
That's right.  And my friends out
in it.

Person_7
I'll cover sector twelve.  Have
com-control set screen alpha.

Person_6
Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
reach the first marker.

Person_2
Then I'll see you in hell!

Person_5
You must come along now, Artoo.
There's really nothing more we can
do.  And my joints are freezing up.

Person_5
Don't say thing like that!  Of
course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll
be quite all right.

Person_8
Sir, all the patrols are in.
There's still no contact from
Skywalker or Solo.

Person_5
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,
although he does admit that his own
range is far too weak to abandon
all hope.

Person_9
Your Highness, there's nothing
more we can do tonight.  The shield
doors must be closed.

Person_9
Close the doors.

Person_8
Yes, sir.

Person_5
Artoo says the chances of survival
are seven hundred seventy-five...
to one.

Person_5
Actually, Artoo has been known to
make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry
about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll
be all right.  He's quite clever,
you know... for a human being.

Side_1
Luke... Luke.

Person_1
Ben?

Side_1
You will go to the Dagobah system.

Person_1
Dagobah system?

Side_1
There you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me.

Person_1
Ben... Ben.

Person_2
Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.

Person_2
Not much time.

Person_1
Ben... Ben...

Person_2
Hang on, kid.

Person_1
Dagobah system...

Person_2
(reeling from the
odor)
Whew...

Person_1
Dagobah...

Person_2
This may smell bad, kid...

Person_1
Yoda...

Person_2
...but it will keep you warm...
til I get the shelter built.
(struggling to get
Luke inside the
carcass)
Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

Side_2
Echo Base... I've got something!  Not
much, but it could be a life form.

Side_2
This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue
Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

Person_2
(filtered over
Zev's receiver)
Good morning.  Nice of you guys
to drop by.

Side_2
Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I
found them.  Repeat, I found them.

Person_5
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

Person_5
Artoo expresses his relief, also.

Person_2
How are you feeling, kid?  You
don't look so bad to me.  In
fact, you look strong enough to
pull the ears off a Gundark.

Person_1
Thanks to you.

Person_2
That's two you owe me, junior.

Person_2
Well your Worship, looks like
you managed to keep me around for
a little while longer.

Person_4
I had nothing to do with it.  General
Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for
any ships to leave the system until
we've activated the energy shield.

Person_2
That's a good story.  I think you
just can't bear to let a gorgeous
guy like me out of your sight.

Person_4
I don't know where you get your
delusions, laser brain.

Person_2
Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you
didn't see us alone in the south
passage.

Person_2
She expressed her true feelings
for me.

Person_4
My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
herder!

Person_2
Who's scruffy-looking?
I must have hit pretty close to
the mark to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

Person_4
Why, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet?

Side_3
Headquarters personnel, report to
command center.

Person_2
Take it easy.

Person_5
Excuse us, please.

Person_3
Princess... we have a visitor.

Person_3
We've picked up something outside
the base in zone twelve, moving
east.

Side_4
It's metal.

Person_4
Then it couldn't be one of those
creatures that attacked Luke.

Person_2
It could be a speeder, one of ours.

Side_4
No.  Wait - there's something very
weak coming through.

Person_5
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.  This signal
is not used by the Alliance.  It
could be an Imperial code.

Person_2
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

Person_3
Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to
station three-eight.

Person_2
Afraid there's not much left.

Person_4
What was it?

Person_2
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
it that hard.  It must have had a
self-destruct.

Person_4
An Imperial probe droid.

Person_2
It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here.

Person_3
We'd better start the evacuation.

Side_5
Admiral.

Side_6
Yes, Captain

Side_5
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment from
a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

Side_6
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.  I want proof,
not leads!

Side_5
The visuals indicate life readings.

Side_6
It could mean anything.  If we
followed every lead...

Side_5
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed
to be devoid of human forms.

Side_7
You found something?

Side_5
Yes, my lord.

Side_7
(studying the image
on the console screen)
That's it.  The Rebels are there.

Side_6
My lord, there are so many uncharted
settlements.  It could be smugglers,
it could be...

Side_7
That is the system.  And I'm sure
Skywalker is with them.  Set your
course for the Hoth system.  General
Veers, prepare you men.

Side_8
Groups seven and ten will stay
behind to fly the speeders.  As
soon as each transport is loaded,
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch.

Side_9
Right, sir.

Person_2
(into comlink, to
Chewie)
Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off!
Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

Side_10
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

Person_1
Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There's plenty of time to get the
smaller modules on the transports.

Side_10
Take care, sir.

Person_1
Thanks.

Person_1
Chewie, take care of yourself,
okay?

Person_2
Hi, kid.
There's got to be a reason for
it.  Check it at the other end.
Wait a second.
You all right?

Person_1
Yeah.

Person_2
Be careful.

Person_1
You, too.

Side_11
General, there's a fleet of Star
Destroyers coming out of hyperspace
in sector four.

Person_3
Reroute all power to the energy
shield.  We've got to hold them till
all transports are away.  Prepare
for ground assault.

Side_7
What is it, General?

Side_12
My lord, the fleet has moves out
of light-speed.  Com-Scan has
detected an energy field protecting
an area around the sixth planet of
the Hoth system.  The field is
strong enough to deflect any
bombardment.

Side_7
The Rebels are alerted to our
presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out
of light-speed too close to the
system.

Side_12
He felt surprise was wiser...

Side_7
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops for a
surface attack.

Side_12
Yes, my lord.

Side_6
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
out of light-speed, and we're
preparing to... Aaagh!

Side_7
You have failed me for the last
time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

Side_5
Yes, my lord.

Side_7
Make ready to land out troops beyond
the energy shield and deploy the
fleet so that nothing gets off that
system.  You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

Side_5
Thank you, Lord Vader.

Person_4
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.  The heavy
transport ships will leave as
soon as they're loaded.  Only two
fighter escorts per ship.  The
energy shield can only be opened
for a short time, so you'll have
to stay very close to your transports.

Side_13
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

Person_4
The ion cannon will fire several
shots to make sure that any enemy
ships will be out of your flight
path.  When you've gotten past the
energy shield, proceed directly to
the rendezvous point.  Understood?

Side_14
Right.  Okay.

Person_4
Good luck.

Person_9
Okay.  Everyone to your stations.
Let's go!

Person_3
Their primary target will be the
power generators.  Prepare to
open the shield.

Side_11
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into
our sector.

Side_15
Good.  Our first catch of the day.

Side_16
Stand by, ion control... Fire!

Side_3
The first transport is away.

Side_17
Feeling all right, sir?

Person_1
Just like new, Dack.  How about
you?

Side_17
Right now I feel like I could take
on the whole Empire myself.

Person_1
(quietly, strapping
in)
I know what you mean.

Side_18
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

Side_18
We have spotted Imperial walkers!

Side_11
Imperial walkers on the north
ridge.

Person_1
Echo station Five-Seven.  We're
on our way.

Person_1
All right, boys, keep tight now.

Side_17
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

Person_1
Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern
delta.  Go now!

Person_1
All right, I'm coming in.

Person_1
Hobbie, you still with me?

Person_1
That armor's too strong for
blasters.

Person_1
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance of
stopping them.
All right, stand by, Dack.

Side_17
Luke, we've got a malfunction in
fire control.  I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

Person_1
Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get
ready to fire that tow cable.

Person_1
Dack?  Dack!

Side_12
Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the
main power generator.  The shield
will be down in moments.  You may
start your landing.

Person_1
Rogue Three.

Side_19
Copy, Rogue Leader

Person_1
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll
have to make this shot.  I'll cover
for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow
me on the next pass.

Side_19
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

Person_1
Steady, Rogue Two

Side_19
Activate harpoon.

Side_19
Good shot, Janson.

Side_19
One more pass.

Side_20
Coming around.  Once more.

Side_20
Once more.

Side_20
Cable out!  Let her go!

Side_19
Detach cable.

Side_20
Cable detached.

Side_18
Come on!

Side_19
Whooha!  That got him!

Person_1
I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

Person_3
I don't think we can protect two
transports at a time.

Person_4
It's risky, but we can't hold out
much longer.  We have no choice.

Person_3
Launch patrols.

Person_4
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

Person_2
No, no!  No!  This one goes there,
that one goes there.  Right?

Person_5
Artoo, you take good care of
Master Luke now, understand?  And
... do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

Side_12
All troops will debark for ground
assault.  Prepare to target the
main generator.

Person_1
Rogue Two, are you all right?

Side_2
Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

Person_1
We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.

Side_2
Coming around.

Person_1
Watch that cross fire, boys.

Side_2
Set for position three.
Steady.

Person_1
Stay tight and low.

Person_1
Hobbie, I've been hit!

Person_2
You all right?

Person_4
Why are you still here?

Person_2
I heard the command center had
been hit.

Person_4
You got your clearance to leave.

Person_2
Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First
I'm going to get you to your ship.

Person_5
Your Highness, we must take this
last transport.  It's our only hope.

Person_4
Send all troops in sector twelve
to the south slope to protect the
fighters.

Side_3
Imperial troops have entered the
base.

Person_2
Come on... that's it.

Person_4
Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports!

Side_21
K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

Person_5
Oh!  Wait for me!

Side_22
Begin retreat!

Side_23
Fall back!

Side_12
Distance to power generators?

Side_24
One-seven, decimal two-eight.

Side_12
Target.  Maximum fire power.

Person_2
Transport, this is Solo.  Better
take off - I can't get to you.
I'll get the princess out on the
Falcon.

Person_5
But... but... but... where are
you going?  Uh... come back!!

Person_5
Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

Person_5
How typical.

Person_2
Come on.

Person_2
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're
going to be a permanent resident!

Person_5
Wait!  Wait!

Person_2
How's this?

Person_4
Would it helped if I got out and
pushed?

Person_2
It might.

Person_5
Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,
might I suggest that you...

Person_5
It can wait.

Person_4
This bucket of bolts is never going
to get us past that blockade.

Person_2
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

Person_2
Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

Person_2
See?

Person_4
Someday you're going to be wrong,
and I hope I'm there to see it.

Person_2
Punch it!

Person_1
Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

Side_19
Good luck, Luke.  See you at
the rendezvous.

Person_1
Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,
we're going.

Person_1
There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
I'm just setting a new course.

Person_1
We're not going to regroup with
the others.

Person_1
We're going to the Dagobah system.

Person_1
Yes, Artoo?

Person_1
That's all right.  I'd like to
keep it on manual control for a
while.

Person_2
I saw them!  I saw them!

Person_4
Saw what?

Person_2
Star Destroyers, two of them,
coming right at us.

Person_5
Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

Person_2
Shut him up or shut him down!
Check the deflector shield!

Person_2
Oh, great.  Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

Side_25
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen
veering to the left.

Side_26
Take evasive action!

Person_2
Prepare to make the jump to light-
speed.

Person_5
But, sir!

Person_4
They're getting closer!

Person_2
(with a gleam in his
eye)
Oh yeah?  Watch this.

Person_4
Watch what?

Person_2
I think we're in trouble.

Person_5
If I may say so, sir, I noticed
earlier that the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.  It's
impossible to go to light-speed!

Person_2
We're in trouble!

Person_2
Horizontal boosters...!
Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's
not it.
Bring me the hydrospanners!

Person_2
I don't know how we're going to
get out of this one.

Person_2
Oww!  Chewie!

Person_2
That was no laser blast!  Something
hit us.

Person_4
Han, get up here!

Person_2
Come on, Chewie!

Person_4
Asteroids!

Person_2
Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
one.

Person_4
What are you doing?  You're not
actually going into an asteroid
field?

Person_2
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

Person_4
You don't have to do this to
impress me.

Person_5
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is
approximately three thousand, seven
hundred and twenty to one.

Person_2
Never tell me the odds!

Person_2
You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake; well, this
could be it, sweetheart.

Person_4
I take it back.  We're going to
get pulverized if we stay out here
much longer.

Person_2
I'm not going to argue with that.

Person_5
Pulverized?

Person_2
I'm going in closer to one of
those big ones.

Person_4
Closer?

Person_5
Closer?!

Person_5
Oh, this is suicide!

Person_2
There.  That looks pretty good.

Person_4
What looks pretty good?

Person_2
Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

Person_5
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are
we going?

Person_4
I hope you know what you're doing.

Person_2
Yeah, me too.

Person_1
Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

Person_1
No, I'm not going to change my
mind about this.
I'm not picking up any cities or
technology.  Massive life-form
readings, though.  There's something
alive down there...

Person_1
Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe
for droids.

Person_1
I know, I know!  All the scopes are
dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just
hang on, I'm going to start the
landing cycle...

Person_1
No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll
have a look around.

Person_1
Artoo?

Person_1
Artoo!  Where are you?

Person_1
Artoo!  You be more careful.

Person_1
Artoo - that way!

Person_1
Artoo!

Person_1
Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come
on.  You're lucky you don't taste
very good.  Anything broken?

Person_1
If you're saying coming here was
a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we
doing here?  It's like... something
out of a dream, or, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

Side_7
Yes, Admiral?

Side_5
Our ships have sighted the
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But...
it has entered an asteroid field
and we cannot risk...

Side_7
Asteroids do not concern me,
Admiral.  I want that ship and
not excuses.

Side_5
Yes, lord.

Person_2
I'm going to shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

Person_5
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but... does that include shutting
me down, too?

Person_2
No, I need you to talk to the
Falcon, find out what's wrong with
the hyperdrive.

Person_5
Sir, it's quite possible this
asteroid is not entirely stable.

Person_2
Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're
here to tell us these things.  Chewie,
take the professor in the back and
plug him into the hyperdrive.

Person_5
Oh!  Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.  After
all, I'm only trying to do my job
in the most...

Person_4
Let go.

Person_2
Sshh!

Person_4
Let go, please.

Person_2
Don't get excited.

Person_4
Captain, being held by you isn't
quite enough to get me excited.

Person_2
Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't
got time for anything else.

Person_1
Ready for some power?  Okay.
Let's see now.  Put that in
there.  There you go.

Person_1
Now all I have to do is find this
Yoda... if he even exists.

Person_1
Still... there's something familiar
about this place.  I feel like...
I don't know...

Side_27
Feel like what?

Person_1
(looking at the
creature)
Like we're being watched!

Side_28
Away with your weapon!  I mean
you no harm.

Side_28
I am wondering, why are you here?

Person_1
I'm looking for someone.

Side_28
Looking?  Found someone, you have,
I would say, hmmm?

Person_1
(Trying to keep from
smiling)
Right.

Side_28
Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

Person_1
I don't think so.  I'm looking
for a great warrior.

Side_28
Ahhh!  A great warrior.
(laughs and shakes
his head)
Wars not make one great.

Person_1
Put that down.  Hey!  That's my
dinner!

Side_28
How you get so big, eating food
of this kind?

Person_1
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would,
but we can't, so why don't you just...

Side_28
Aww, cannot get your ship out?

Person_1
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're
making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

Side_28
(retreating with
the lamp)
Mine!  Or I will help you not.

Person_1
I don't want your help.  I want
my lamp back.  I'll need it to
get out of this slimy mudhole.

Side_28
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

Side_28
Ah, ah, ah!

Person_1
Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

Side_28
Mine!  Mine!

Person_1
Artoo!

Side_28
Mine!

Side_28
Mine!

Person_1
Now will you move along, little
fella?  We're got a lot of work
to do.

Side_28
No!  No, no!  Stay and help you,
I will.
Find your friend, hmm?

Person_1
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

Side_28
Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You
seek Yoda.

Person_1
You know him?

Side_28
Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
Come.  Good food.  Come.

Side_28
Come, come.

Person_1
Stay here and watch after the
camp, Artoo.

Person_5
Oh, where is Artoo when I need
him?

Person_5
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate, but it
has the most peculiar dialect.  I
believe, sir, it says that the
power coupling on the negative
axis has been polarized.  I'm
afraid you'll have to replace it.

Person_2
Well, of course I'll have to replace
it.

Person_2
Here!  And Chewie...

Person_2
... I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

Person_2
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only
trying to help.

Person_4
Would you please stop calling me
that?

Person_2
Sure, Leia.

Person_4
Oh, you make it so difficult
sometimes.

Person_2
I do, I really do.  You could be
a little nicer, though.
(he watches her
reaction)
Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you
think I'm all right.

Person_4
Occasionally...
(a little smile,
haltingly)
... when you aren't acting like
a scoundrel.

Person_2
Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like
the sound of that.

Person_4
Stop that.

Person_2
Stop what?

Person_4
Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

Person_2
My hands are dirty, too.  What
are you afraid of?

Person_4
(looking right
into his eyes)
Afraid?

Person_2
You're trembling.

Person_4
I'm not trembling.

Person_2
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in
your life.

Person_4
I happen to like nice men.

Person_2
I'm a nice man.

Person_4
No, you're not.  You're...

Person_5
Sir, sir!  I've isolated the
reverse power flux coupling.

Person_2
Thank you.  Thank you very much.

Person_5
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

Side_29
... and that, Lord Vader, was the
last time they appeared in any of
our scopes.  Considering the amount
of damage we've sustained, they
must have been destroyed.

Side_7
No, Captain, they're alive.  I
want every ship available to
sweep the asteroid field until
they are found.

Side_5
Lord Vader.

Side_7
Yes, Admiral, what is it?

Side_5
The Emperor commands you make
contact with him.

Side_7
Move the ship out of the asteroid
field so that we can send a clear
transmission.

Side_5
Yes, my lord.

Side_7
What is thy bidding, my master?

Side_30
There is a great disturbance in
the Force.

Side_7
I have felt it.

Side_30
We have a new enemy - Luke
Skywalker.

Side_7
Yes, my master.

Side_30
He could destroy us.

Side_7
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no
longer help him.

Side_30
The Force is strong with him.  The
son of Skywalker must not become a
Jedi.

Side_7
If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally.

Side_30
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great
asset.  Can it be done?

Side_7
He will join us or die, my
master.

Person_1
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
I just don't understand why we
can't see Yoda now.

Side_28
Patience!  For the Jedi it is
time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.
Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

Person_1
How far away is Yoda?  Will it
take us long to get there?

Side_28
Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
(tasting food from
the pot)
Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you
become Jedi?  Hm?

Person_1
Mostly because of my father, I
guess.

Side_28
Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi
was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

Person_1
Oh, come on.  How could you know
my father?  You don't even know
who I am.
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
here.  We're wasting our time.

Side_28
I cannot teach him.  The boy has
no patience.

Side_1'S VOICE
He will learn patience.

Side_32
Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

Side_1'S VOICE
Was I any different when you
taught me?

Side_32
Hah.  He is not ready.

Person_1
Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I
can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm
ready.

Side_32
Ready, are you?  What know you
of ready?  For eight hundred years
have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel
will I keep on who is to be trained!
A Jedi must have the deepest
commitment, the most serious mind.
(to the invisible
Ben, indicating Luke)
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away...
to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was.
Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.
Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!
A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless!

Side_1'S VOICE
So was I, if you'll remember.

Side_32
He is too old.  Yes, too old to
begin the training.

Person_1
But I've learned so much.

Side_32
Will he finished what he begins?

Person_1
I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

Side_32
(turns slowly toward
him)
Oh, you will be.  You will be.

Person_5
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

Person_2
I'm not really interested in your
opinion, Threepio.

Person_4
There's something out there.

Person_2
Where?

Person_4
Outside, in the cave.

Person_5
There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

Person_2
I'm going out there.

Person_4
Are you crazy?!

Person_2
I just got this bucket back
together.  I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

Person_4
Then I'm going with you.

Person_5
I think it might be better if I
stay here and guard the ship.
(hears another
mysterious noise)
Oh, no.

Person_4
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock at all.

Person_2
There's an awful lot of moisture
in here.

Person_4
I don't know.  I have a bad feeling
about this.

Person_2
Yeah.

Person_2
Watch out!

Person_2
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest
of the ship, make sure there
aren't any more attached.  They're
chewing on the power cables.

Person_4
Mynocks?

Person_2
Go on inside.  We'll clean them
off if there are any more.

Person_5
Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly
little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

Person_2
Wait a minute...

Person_2
All right, Chewie, let's get
out of here!

Person_4
The Empire is still out there.
I don't think it's wise to...

Person_2
No time to discuss this in
committee.

Person_4
I am not a committee!

Person_4
You can't make the jump to light-
speed in this asteroid field...

Person_2
Sit down, sweetheart.  We're
taking off!

Person_5
Look!

Person_2
I see it, I see it.

Person_5
We're doomed!

Person_4
The cave is collapsing.

Person_2
This is no cave.

Person_4
What?

Side_32
Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.  But beware
of the dark side.  Anger... fear...
aggression.  The dark side of
the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join
you in a fight.  If once you
start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan's apprentice.

Person_1
Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

Side_32
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

Person_1
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?

Side_32
You will know.  When you are calm,
at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and
defense, never for attack.

Person_1
But tell me why I can't...

Side_32
No, no, there is no why.  Nothing
more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

Person_1
There's something not right here.

Person_1
I feel cold, death.

Side_32
That place... is strong with the
dark side of the Force.  A domain
of evil it is.  In you must go.

Person_1
What's in there?

Side_32
Only what you take with you.

Side_32
Your weapons... you will not
need them.

Side_5
Bounty hunters.  We don't need
that scum.

Side_33
Yes, sir.

Side_5
Those Rebels won't escape us.

Side_34
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

Side_5
Right.

Side_7
... there will be a substantial
reward for the one who finds the
Millennium Falcon.  You are free
to use any methods necessary, but
I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

Side_35
As you wish.

Side_5
Lord Vader!  My lord, we have
them.

Person_5
Oh, thank goodness we're coming
out of the asteroid field.

Person_2
Let's get out of here.  Ready for
light-speed?  One... two... three!

Person_2
It's not fair!

Person_2
The transfer circuits are working.
It's not my fault!

Person_4
(almost expecting
it)
No light-speed?

Person_2
It's not my fault.

Person_5
Sir, we just lost the main rear
deflector shield.  One more direct
hit on the back quarter and we're
done for.

Person_2
Turn her around.

Person_2
I said turn her around!  I'm
going to put all power in the
front shield.

Person_4
You're going to attack them?!

Person_5
Sir, the odds of surviving a
direct assault on an Imperial
Star Destroyer...

Person_4
Shut up!

Side_29
They're moving to attack
position!  Shields up!

Side_29
Track them.  They may come
around for another pass.

Side_36
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

Side_29
They can't have disappeared.  No
ship that small has a cloaking
device.

Side_36
Well, there's no trace of them,
sir.

Side_37
Captain, Lord Vader demands an
update on the pursuit.

Side_29
Get a shuttle ready.  I shall
assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord
Vader. Meanwhile, continue to
scan the area.

Side_37
Yes, Captain Needa.

Side_32
Use the Force.  Yes...

Side_32
Now... the stone.  Feel it.

Side_32
Concentrate!

Person_1
Oh, no.  We'll never get it out
now.

Side_32
So certain are you.  Always with
you it cannot be done.  Hear you
nothing that I say?

Person_1
Master, moving stones around is
one thing.  This is totally
different.

Side_32
No!  No different!  Only different
in your mind.  You must unlearn
what you have learned.

Person_1
All right, I'll give it a try.

Side_32
No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.
There is no try.

Person_1
I can't.  It's too big.

Side_32
Size matters not.  Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?  Mmmm.

Side_32
And well you should not.  For my
ally in the Force.  And a powerful
ally it is.  Life creates it, makes
it grow.  Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.  Luminous beings
are we...
(Yoda pinches
Luke's shoulder)
... not this crude matter.
You must feel the Force around you.
Here, between you... me... the
tree... the rock... everywhere!
Yes, even between this land and
that ship!

Person_1
You want the impossible.

Person_1
I don't... I don't believe it.

Side_32
That is why you fail.

Side_7
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

Side_5
Lord Vader, our ships have
completed their scan of the area
and found nothing.  If the
Millennium Falcon went into light-
speed, it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

Side_7
Alert all commands.  Calculate
every possible destination along
their last know trajectory.

Side_5
Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

Side_7
Don't fail me again, Admiral.

Side_5
Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

Person_5
Captain Solo, this time you have
gone too far.
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

Person_2
The fleet is beginning to break
up.  Go back and stand by the
manual release for the landing claw.

Person_5
I really don't see how that is
going to help.  Surrender is a
perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances.  The
Empire may be gracious enough...

Person_2
Thank you.

Person_4
What did you have in mind for
your next move?

Person_2
Well, if they follow standard
Imperial procedure, they'll dump
their garbage before they go to
light-speed, then we just float
away.

Person_4
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

Person_2
Then we've got to find a safe
port somewhere around here.  Got
any ideas?

Person_4
No.  Where are we?

Person_2
The Anoat system.

Person_4
Anoat system.  There's not much
there.

Person_2
No.  Well, wait.  This is
interesting.  Lando.

Person_4
Lando system?

Person_2
Lando's not a system, he's a man.
Lando Calrissian.  He's a card
player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd
like him.

Person_4
Thanks.

Person_2
Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I
think we can make it.

Person_4
(reading from the
computer)
A mining colony?

Person_2
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando
conned somebody out of it.  We
go back a long way, Lando and me.

Person_4
Can you trust him?

Person_2
No.  But he has no love for the
Empire, I can tell you that.

Person_2
Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
Detach!

Person_4
You do have your moments.  Not
many, but you have them.

Side_32
Concentrate... feel the Force
flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you
will see.  Other places.  The
future... the past.  Old friends
long gone.

Person_1
Han!  Leia!

Side_32
Hmm.  Control, control.  You must
learn control.

Person_1
I saw... I saw a city in the
clouds.

Side_32
Mmm.  Friends you have there.

Person_1
They were in pain.

Side_32
It is the future you see.

Person_1
Future?  Will they die?

Side_32
Difficult to see.  Always in
motion is the future.

Person_1
I've got to go to them.

Side_32
Decide you must how to serve
them best.  If you leave now,
help them you could.  But you
would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered.

Person_2
No, I don't have a landing
permit.  I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

Person_2
Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me
explain.

Side_38
You will not deviate from your
present course.

Person_5
Rather touchy, aren't they?

Person_4
I thought you knew this person.

Person_2
Well, that was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about
that.

Side_38
Permission granted to land on
Platform Three-two-seven.

Person_2
Thank you.

Person_2
There's nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

Person_4
Who's worried?

Person_5
Oh.  No one to meet us.

Person_4
I don't like this.

Person_2
Well, what would you like?

Person_5
Well, they did let us land.

Person_2
Look, don't worry.  Everything's
going to be fine.  Trust me.

Person_2
See?  My friend.
Keep your eyes open, okay?

Side_39
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler!  You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after
what you pulled.

Side_39
How you doing, you old pirate?
So good to see you!  I never thought
I'd catch up with you again.  Where
you been?

Person_5
Well, he seems very friendly.

Person_4
Yes... very friendly.

Side_39
What are you doing here?

Person_2
(gestures toward
the Falcon)
Ahh... repairs.  I thought you
could help me out.

Side_39
What have you done to my ship?

Person_2
Your ship?  Hey, remember, you
lost her to me fair and square.

Side_39
Hello.  What have we here?
Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this
facility.  And who might you be?

Person_4
Leia.

Side_39
Welcome, Leia.

Person_2
All right, all right, you old
smoothie.

Person_5
Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations.  My
facilities are at your...

Person_5
Well, really!

Side_39
What's wrong with the Falcon?

Person_2
Hyperdrive.

Side_39
I'll get my people to work on it.

Person_2
Good.

Side_39
You know, that ship saved my life
quite a few times.  She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

Person_2
How's the gas mine?  Is it
paying off for you?

Side_39
Oh, not as well as I'd like.
We're a small outpost and not
very self-sufficient.  And I've
had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labor difficulties...
(catches Han
grinning at him)
What's so funny?

Person_2
You.  Listen to you - you sound
like a businessman, a responsible
leader.  Who'd have thought that,
huh?

Side_39
You know, seeing you sure
brings back a few things.

Person_2
Yeah.

Side_39
Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay for being
successful.

Person_5
Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

Side_40
E chu ta!

Person_5
How rude!

Person_5
That sounds like an R2 unit in
there.  I wonder if...

Person_5
Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

Side_41
Who are you?

Person_5
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I
didn't mean to intrude.  No, no,
please don't get up.  No!

Side_32
Luke!  You must complete the
training.

Person_1
I can't keep the vision out of my
head.  They're my friends.  I've
got to help them.

Side_32
You must not go!

Person_1
But Han and Leia will die if I
don't.

Side_1'S VOICE
You don't know that.

Side_1
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

Person_1
But I can help them!  I feel
the Force!

Side_1
But you cannot control it.  This
is a dangerous time for you,
when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force.

Side_32
Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.  Remember your failure
at the cave!

Person_1
But I've learned so much since
then.  Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.

Side_1
It is you and your abilities the
Emperor wants.  that is why your
friends are made to suffer.

Person_1
And that is why I have to go.

Side_1
Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

Person_1
You won't.

Side_32
Stopped they must be.  On this
all depends.  Only a fully trained
Jedi Knight with the Force as his
ally will conquer Vader and his
Emperor.  If you end your training
now, if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did, you will
become an agent of evil.

Side_1
Patience.

Person_1
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

Side_32
If you honor what they fight for
... yes!

Side_1
If you choose to face Vader, you
will do it alone.  I cannot
interfere.

Person_1
I understand.
(he moves to his
X-wing)
Artoo, fire up the converters.

Side_1
Luke, don't give in to hate -
that leads to the dark side.

Side_32
Strong is Vader.  Mind what you
have learned.  Save you it can.

Person_1
I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

Side_32
Told you, I did.  Reckless is
he.  Now matters are worse.

Side_1
That boy is our last hope.

Side_32
No.  There is another.

Person_2
The ship is almost finished.
Two or Three more things and
we're in great shape.

Person_4
The sooner the better.  Something's
wrong here.  No one has seen or
knows anything about Threepio.
He's been gone too long to have
gotten lost.

Person_2
Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and
see what I can find out.

Person_4
I don't trust Lando.

Person_2
Well, I don't trust him, either.
But he is my friend.  Besides,
we'll soon be gone.

Person_4
And then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

Person_4
What happened?

Person_2
Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

Person_4
Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you
think you can repair him?

Person_2
Lando's got people who can fix
him.

Person_4
No, thanks.

Side_39
I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting
anything?

Person_4
Not really.

Side_39
You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

Person_4
Thank you.

Side_39
Will you join me for a little
refreshment?

Side_39
Everyone's invited, of course.

Side_39
Having trouble with you droid?

Person_2
No.  No problem.  Why?

Side_39
So you see, since we're a small
operation, we don't fall into
the... uh... jurisdiction of the
Empire.

Person_4
So you're part of the mining
guild then?

Side_39
No, not actually.  Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed...
which is advantageous for everybody
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to
themselves.

Person_2
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out about this
little operation and shut you down?

Side_39
That's always been a danger looming
like a shadow over everything we've
built here.  But things have
developed that will insure security.
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

Side_7
We would be honored if you would
join us.

Side_39
I had no choice.  They arrived
right before you did.  I'm sorry.

Person_2
I'm sorry, too.

Person_1
No, Threepio's with them.

Person_1
Just hang on.  We're almost there.

Person_5
Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take
this off!  I, uh, don't mean to
intrude here.  I, don't, no, no,
no... Please don't get up.  No!

Person_5
Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in
danger.  I must tell the others.
Oh, no!  I've been shot!

Side_39
Lord Vader.

Side_7
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hut after I have
Skywalker.

Side_35
He's no good to me dead.

Side_7
He will not be permanently damaged.

Side_39
Lord Vader, what about Leia and
the Wookiee?

Side_7
They must never again leave this
city.

Side_39
That was never a condition of our
agreement, nor was giving Han to
this bounty hunter!

Side_7
Perhaps you think you're being
treated unfairly.

Side_39
No.

Side_7
Good.  It would be unfortunate if
I had to leave a garrison here.

Side_39
This deal's getting worse all
the time.

Person_5
Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like
that.  Oh!  Something's not right
because now I can't see.  Wait.
Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?
I'm backwards, you stupid furball.
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

Person_2
I feel terrible.

Person_4
Why are they doing this?

Person_2
They never even asked me any
questions.

Person_4
Lando.

Person_2
Get out of here, Lando!

Side_39
Shut up and listen!  Vader has
agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
over to me.

Person_2
Over to you?

Side_39
They'll have to stay here, but at
least they'll be safe.

Person_4
What about Han?

Side_39
Vader's giving him to the bounty
hunter.

Person_4
Vader wants us all dead.

Side_39
He doesn't want you at all.  He's
after somebody called Skywalker.

Person_2
Luke?

Side_39
Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

Person_4
And we're the bait.

Side_39
Well, he's on his way.

Person_2
Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty
good, didn't you?
My friend!

Side_39
Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm
sorry I couldn't do better, but
I have my own problems.

Person_2
Yeah, you're a real hero.

Person_4
You certainly have a way with
people.

Side_7
This facility is crude, but it
should be adequate to freeze
Skywalker for his journey to the
Emperor.

Side_42
Lord Vader, ship approaching.
X-wing class.

Side_7
Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow
him to land.

Side_39
Lord Vader, we only use this
facility for carbon freezing.  If
you put him in there, it might
kill him.

Side_7
I do not want the Emperor's prize
damaged.  We will test it... on
Captain Solo.

Person_5
If only you had attached my legs,
I wouldn't be in this ridiculous
position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility to me,
so don't do anything foolish.

Person_2
What's going on... buddy?

Side_39
You're being put into carbon freeze.

Side_35
What if he doesn't survive?  He's
worth a lot to me.

Side_7
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies.  Put him in!

Person_5
Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,
Chewbacca, stop...!

Person_2
Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear
me?  Stop!

Person_5
Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready
to die.

Person_2
Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help
me.  Hey!

Person_2
Save your strength.  There'll be
another time.  The princess - you
have to take care of her.  You
hear me?

Person_4
I love you!

Person_2
I know.

Person_5
What... what's going on?  Turn
round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
Oh... they've encased him in
carbonite.  He should be quite
well-protected - if he survives
the freezing process, that is.

Side_7
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

Side_39
Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect
hibernation.

Side_7
He's all yours bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

Side_26
Skywalker has just landed, my
lord.

Side_7
Good.  See to it that he finds
his way here.  Calrissian, take
the princess and the Wookiee to
my ship.

Side_39
You said they'd be left in the
city under my supervision.

Side_7
I am altering the deal.  Pray I
don't alter it any further.

Person_4
Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a
trap!  It's a trap!

Side_7
The Force is with you, young
Skywalker.  But you are not a
Jedi yet.

Side_39
Well done.  Hold them in the
security tower - and keep it
quiet.  Move.

Person_4
What do you think you're doing?

Side_39
We're getting out of here.

Person_5
I knew all along it had to be a
mistake.

Person_4
Do you think that after what you
did to Han we're going to trust
you?

Side_39
I had no choice...

Person_5
What are you doing?  Trust him,
trust him!

Person_4
Oh, so we understand, don't we,
Chewie?  He had no choice.

Side_39
I'm just trying to help...

Person_4
We don't need any of your help.

Side_39
H-a-a-a...

Person_4
What?

Person_5
It sounds like Han.

Side_39
There's still a chance to save
Han... I mean, at the East
Platform...

Person_4
Chewie.

Person_5
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

Side_35
Put Captain Solo in the cargo
hold.

Person_5
Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you
been?

Person_5
Turn around, you wooly...!
Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to
save Han from the bounty hunter!

Person_5
Well, at least your still in
one piece!  Look what happened to
me!

Person_5
Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind
you!

Side_7
You have learned much, young one.

Person_1
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

Side_7
Your destiny lies with me,
Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to
be true.

Person_1
No!

Side_7
All to easy.  Perhaps you are not
as strong as the Emperor thought.

Side_7
Impressive... most impressive.

Side_7
Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You
have controlled your fear... now
release your anger.

Side_7
Only your hatred can destroy me.

Side_39
The security codes has been changed!

Person_5
Artoo, you can tell the computer
to override the security system.

Side_39
Attention!  This is Lando
Calrissian.  The Empire has takes
control of the city.  I advise
everyone to leave before more
Imperial troops arrive.

Side_39
This way.

Person_5
Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power
socket from a computer terminal.

Person_5
What are you talking about?  We're
not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon.  It's
fixed!  Just open the door, you
stupid lump.

Person_5
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

Person_5
Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend
down, you thoughtless... Ow!

Side_39
Leia!  Go!

Person_5
I thought that hairy beast would
be the end of me.  Of course, I've
looked better.

Side_7
You are beaten.  It is useless
to resist.  Don't let yourself
be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

Side_7
There is no escape.  Don't make
me destroy you.  You do not yet
realize your importance.  You
have only begun to discover your
power.  Join me and I will complete
your training.  With our combined
strength, we can end this destructive
conflict and bring order to the
galaxy.

Person_1
I'll never join you!

Side_7
If you only knew the power of the
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father.

Person_1
He told me enough!  It was you
who killed him.

Side_7
No.  I am your father.

Person_1
No.  No.  That's not true!
That's impossible!

Side_7
Search your feelings.  You know
it to be true.

Person_1
No!  No!  No!

Side_7
Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your
destiny.  Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy as father
and son.  Come with me.  It is the
only way.

Person_1
Ben... Ben, please!

Person_1
Ben.  Leia!

Person_1
Hear me!  Leia!

Person_4
Luke... We've got to go back.

Side_39
What?

Person_4
I know where Luke is.

Side_39
But what about those fighter?

Person_4
Chewie, just do it.

Side_39
But what about Vader?

Side_39
All right, all right, all right.

Side_7
Bring my shuttle.

Side_39
(pointing out the
cockpit window)
Look, someone's up there.

Person_4
It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
Slow down and we'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

Person_4
Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

Person_4
Lando?

Side_39
Okay, let's go.

Person_1
Oh, Leia.

Side_39
All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

Person_4
I'll be back.

Person_4
Star Destroyer.

Side_39
All right, Chewie.  Ready for
light-speed.

Person_4
If your people fixed the
hyperdrive.

Person_4
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

Side_39
Punch it!

Side_39
They told me they fixed it.  I
trusted them to fix it.  It's not
my fault!

Side_5
They'll be in range of our
tractor beam in moments, my lord.

Side_7
Did your men deactivate the
hyperdrive on the Millennium
Falcon?

Side_5
Yes, my lord.

Side_7
Good.  Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

Side_5
Yes, my lord.

Person_5
Noisy brute.  Why don't we just
go into light-speed?

Person_5
We can't?  How would you know the
hyperdrive is deactivated?

Person_5
The city's central computer told
you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch!  Pay attention to what
you're doing!

Side_7
Luke.

Person_1
Father.

Side_7
Son, come with me.

Person_1
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Side_39
Chewie!

Person_1
It's Vader.

Side_7
Luke... it is your destiny.

Person_1
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

Side_5
Alert all commands.  Ready for
the tractor beam.

Person_5
Artoo, come back at once!  You
haven't finished with me yet!
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do
it.  I'm standing here in pieces,
and you're having delusions of
grandeur!

Person_5
Oh, you did it!

Side_39
Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

Person_1
Good luck, Lando

Side_39
When we find Jabba the Hut and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact
you.

Person_1
I'll meet you at the rendezvous
point on Tatooine.

Side_39
Princess, we'll find Han.  I
promise.

Person_1
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your
signal.

Person_1
Take care, you two.  May the
Force be with you.

Person_1
Ow!

Person_1
June 3, 2008

Person_2
I see you like to CHEW!
Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!

Person_3
Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!

Person_4
And ATTRACTIVE!

Person_5
How can we repay you??

Person_3
There is no charge for awesomeness,
or attractiveness.

Person_6
We should hang out.

Person_3
Agreed.

Person_6
Po! Get up!

Person_7
You'll be late for work!

Person_8
Whu?

Person_8'S DAD (O.S.)
Po! What are you doing up there?

Person_8
Uh, nothing!

Person_8
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
Tigress! Rowrrrr...

Person_8
Coming!

Person_8
Sorry, Dad.

Person_8'S DAD
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

Person_8'S DAD
What were you doing up there? All
that noise.

Person_8
Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
dream.

Person_8'S DAD
About what?

Person_8
Huh?

Person_8'S DAD
The dream. What were you dreaming
about?

Person_8
What was I... eh, I was dreaming
about uh... heh...

Person_8
Noodles.

Person_8'S DAD
Noodles. You were really dreaming
about noodles?

Person_8
Uh, yeah. What else would I be
dreaming about?

Person_8
Careful, that soup is... sharp!

Person_8'S DAD
Oh, happy day! My son, finally
having the noodle dream!

Person_8'S DAD
You don't know how long I have been
waiting for this moment.

Person_8'S DAD
This is a sign, Po!

Person_8
Uh...a sign of what?

Person_8'S DAD
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret
ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
Soup." And then you will fulfill
your destiny and take over the
restaurant, just as I took it over
from my father, who took it over
from his father, who won it from a
friend in a game of mahjong.

Person_8
Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.

Person_8'S DAD
No, it was the dream. We are noodle
folk. Broth runs through our veins.

Person_8
But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
want to do something else?
Something besides noodles?

Person_8'S DAD
Actually...

Person_8'S DAD
When I was young and crazy...

Person_8'S DAD
I thought about running away and
learning how to make tofu.

Person_8
So why didn't you?!

Person_8'S DAD
Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
Can you imagine, me making tofu?
No. We all have our place in this
world. Mine is here. And yours is--

Person_8
I know. Is here.

Person_8'S DAD
No, it's at tables two, five,
seven, and twelve.

Person_8'S DAD
Service with a smile!

Side_2
Well done, students... if you were
trying to disappoint me.

Side_2
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey, greater speed.

Side_2
Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
Mantis--

Side_3
Master Shifu!

Side_2
What?!

Side_3
Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
to see you.

Side_2
Master Oogway? You summoned me.

Side_2
Is something wrong?

Side_4
Why must something be wrong for me
to want to see my old friend?

Side_2
So... nothing's wrong?

Side_4
Well, I didn't say that.

Side_2
You were saying?

Side_4
I have had a vision... Tai Lung
will return.

Side_2
That is impossible. He is in
prison.

Side_4
Nothing is impossible.

Side_2
Zeng!

Side_2
Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
to double the guards, double their
weapons. Double everything! Tai
Lung does not leave that prison!

Side_3
Yes, Master Shifu.

Side_4
One often meets his destiny on the
road he takes to avoid it.

Side_2
We have to do something. We can't
just let him march on the valley,
and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--

Side_4
Your mind is like this water, my
friend. When it is agitated, it
becomes difficult to see. But if
you allow it to settle, the answer
becomes clear.

Side_2
The Dragon Scroll...

Side_4
It is time.

Side_2
But who? Who is worthy to be
trusted with the secret to
limitless power? To become...the
Dragon Warrior?!

Side_4
I don't know.

Person_8
Oop...sorry.

Side_5
Hey! Watch it, Po!

Person_8
Sorry. Suck it up.

Side_6
Ugh!

Person_8
Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.

Person_8
What?! Master Oogway's choosing the
Dragon Warrior! Today!

Person_8
Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the
Jade Palace!

Person_8
One of the Five is gonna get the
Dragon Scroll!

Person_8
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this! Just take the bowl!

Person_8
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it, just
go!

Person_8'S DAD
Po! Where are you going?

Person_8
To the...Jade Palace?

Person_8'S DAD
But you're forgetting your noodle
cart! The whole valley will be
there, and you'll sell noodles to
all of them.

Person_8
Selling noodles? But Dad, you know,
I was kinda thinking maybe I...

Person_8'S DAD
Yeah?

Person_8
I was kinda thinking maybe I...

Person_8'S DAD
Uh huh?

Person_8
...Could also sell the bean buns.
They are about to go bad.

Person_8'S DAD
That's my boy! I told you that
dream was a sign!

Person_8
Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.

Person_8
Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost
there...

Person_8
What? No! Oh No!

Side_7
Sorry, Po.

Side_8
We'll bring you back a souvenir.

Person_8
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

Side_2
It is an historic day, isn't it,
Master Oogway?

Side_4
Yes, and one I feared I would not
live to see. Are your students
ready?

Side_2
Yes, Master Oogway.

Side_4
Now know this, old friend. Whomever
I choose will not only bring peace
to the Valley, but also to you.

Side_9
Let the tournament begin!

Person_8
Yeah!

Person_8
Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!

Person_8
Hey! Open the door!

Person_8
Let me in!

Side_2
Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It
is my great honor to present to
you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!

Person_8
The Furious Five!

Side_2
Warriors prepare!

Person_8
Peeky-hole!

Side_2
Ready for battle!

Person_8
Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of
Fire!

Side_10
Whoa! Look at that.

Person_8
Hey, get out of the way!

Person_8
Ow...

Side_2
And finally...Master Tigress!

Side_2 (O.S.)
And believe me citizens, you have
not seen anything yet!

Side_4
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among
us.

Side_2
Citizens of the Valley of Peace!
Master Oogway will now choose...
the Dragon Warrior!

Person_8
Huh? Oh no! Wait!

Person_8
Yeah!

Person_8'S DAD
What are you doing?

Person_8
What does it look like I'm doing?
Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the
Dragon Warrior!

Person_8'S DAD
But I don't understand. You finally
had the noodle dream.

Person_8
I lied. I don't dream about
noodles, Dad!

Person_8
I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-

Person_8'S DAD
Come on, son. Let's get back to
work.

Person_8
Okay.

Person_8'S DAD
Oh! Come back!

Side_12
Oooh! Aaahh!

Person_8
Uh oh...

Person_8
What's going on? Where...uh? What
are you pointing--?

Person_8
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to
see who the Dragon Warrior was.

Side_4
How interesting.

Person_7
Master, are you pointing at...me?

Side_4
Him.

Person_8
Who--?

Side_4
You.

Person_8
Me?

Side_4
The universe has brought us the
Dragon Warrior!

Person_8
What?

Side_13
What??

Side_2
What???

Side_2
Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?

Side_2
Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
panda can't possibly be the answer
to... our problem. You were about
to point at Tigress. That thing
fell in front of her. That was just
an accident!

Side_4
There are no accidents.

Person_7
Forgive us, Master. We have failed
you.

Side_2
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I will have failed
you.

Side_3
Wait wait wait! I bring a message
from Master Shifu.

Side_14
What?!?!
"Double the guard?! Extra
precautions?! Your prison may not
be adequate!"

Side_14
You doubt my prison's security?

Side_3
Absolutely not.
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

Side_14
I'll give you a message for your
Master Shifu.

Side_14
Escape from Chogun Prison is
impossible!

Side_3
Whoa.

Side_14
Impressive, isn't it?

Side_3
Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
impressive.

Side_14
One way in, one way out, one
thousand guards, and one prisoner.

Side_3
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
Lung...

Side_14
Take us down.

Side_3
What are you doing?!

Side_3
Oh my...

Side_14
Behold, Tai Lung.

Side_3
I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
here.

Side_14
It's nothing to worry about. It's
perfectly safe.

Side_3
Oof!

Side_14
Crossbows! At the ready!

Side_3
Crossbows?!

Side_14
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's finally gonna give someone
the Dragon Scroll and it's not
gonna be you!

Side_3
What are you doing?! Don't get him
mad.

Side_14
What's he gonna do about it? I've
got him completely immobilized.

Side_14
Awww. Did I step on the witty
kitty's tail? Awww.

Side_3
I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
to worry about.

Side_14
No, he doesn't.

Side_3
Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
please go now?

Side_12
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

Person_8
Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think
there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm,
uh...

Person_8
Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors.
No way! Would you look at this
place!

Person_8
Nooo! Ohhhh!

Person_8
The legendary Urn of Whispering
Warriors! Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu army.
Hellooo?

Side_2
Have you finished sight-seeing?

Person_8
Sorry. I should've come to see you
first.

Side_2
My patience is wearing thin.

Person_8
Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

Side_2
Would you turn around?

Person_8
Sure.

Person_8
Hey, how's it going?

Person_8
Now how do you get five thousand--
Master Shifu!

Person_8
Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna
fix it. Do you have some glue?

Person_8
Ow! Ooh. Splinter.

Side_2
So you're the legendary Dragon
Warrior. Hmmm?

Person_8
Uh...I guess so?

Side_2
Wrong! You are not the Dragon
Warrior. You will never be the
Dragon Warrior until you have
learned the secret of the Dragon
Scroll.

Person_8
Whoa.
So how does this work? You have a
ladder or trampoline or...?

Side_2
You think it's that easy? That I am
just going to hand you the secret
to limitless power?

Person_8
No, I...

Side_2
One must first master the highest
level of kung fu. And that is
clearly impossible if that one is
someone like you.

Person_8
Someone like me?

Side_2
Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.

Side_2
Flabby arms...

Person_8
Those are sensitive in the flabby
parts.

Side_2
And this ridiculous belly.

Person_8
Hey...

Side_2
--and utter disregard for personal
hygiene.

Person_8
Now wait a minute. That's a little
uncalled-for.

Side_2
Don't stand that close...I can
smell your breath.

Person_8
Listen...Oogway said that I was the-

Person_8
The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi
Finger Hold!

Side_2
Oh, you know this hold?

Person_8
DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna
sty-- YES.

Side_2
Oh, then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

Person_8
No no no!

Side_2
You know the hardest part of this?
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards...

Person_8
Okay! Okay! Take it easy...

Side_2
Now listen closely, panda. Oogway
may have picked you, but when I'm
through with you, I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't. Are
we clear?

Person_8
Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We
are so clear.

Side_2
Good. I can't wait to get started.

Side_2
Let's begin.

Person_8
Wait wait wait...What? Now?

Side_2
Yes...now. Unless you think the
great Oogway was wrong, and you are
not the Dragon Warrior.

Person_8
Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I
can do all of those moves.

Side_2
Well, if we don't try, we'll never
know will we?

Person_8
Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can
find something more suited to my
level.

Side_2
And what level is that?

Person_8
Well, ya know...I'm not a master,
but uh, let's just start at zero,
level zero.

Side_2
There is no such thing as level
zero.

Person_8
Hey! Maybe I can start with that.

Side_2
That? We use that for training
children. And for propping the door
open when it's hot. But if you
insist...

Person_8
Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so
much bigger than your action
figures -- except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

Side_2
Go ahead, panda. Show us what you
can do.

Person_8
Um, are they gonna watch? Or should
I just wait until they get back to
work or something...

Side_2
Hit it.

Person_8
Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm
still digesting... So my kung fu
might not be as good as later on.

Side_2
Just hit it.

Person_8
Alright. Whatcha got? You got
nothing cause I got it right here.
You picking on my friends? Get
ready to feel the thunder. I'm
comin' at him with the crazy feet.
Whatcha gonna do about my crazy
feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You
never seen bear style, you only
seen praying Mantis! OR... I could
come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm
comin' at ya snikity-snake.

Side_2
Would you hit it!

Person_8
Alright...alright.

Side_2
Why don't you try again?   A little
harder...

Person_8
How's tha--

Person_8
Ow, that hurts.

Side_2
This'll be easier than I thought.

Person_8
Feeling a little nauseous.

Person_8
Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think

Person_8
Oooohoohoo...my tenders.

Person_8
How did I do?

Side_2
There is now a level zero.

Side_15
There's no words.

Side_16
No denying that.

Side_17
I don't understand what Master
Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
just gonna get himself killed.

Side_16
He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
fell out of the sky on a ball of
fire.

Side_15
When he walks, the very ground
shakes!

Person_7
One would think that Master Oogway
would choose someone who actually
knew Kung Fu.

Side_16
Yeah, or could at least touch his
toes.

Person_6
Or even see his toes.

Person_8
Okay.

Person_8
Great.

Person_8
Oh hey...hi. You're up.

Side_16
Am now.

Person_8
I was just uh... Some day huh?
That kung fu stuff is hard work,
right? Your biceps sore?

Side_16
Um...I've had a long and rather
disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I
should probably get to sleep now.

Person_8
Yeah yeah yeah, of course.

Side_16
Okay, thanks.

Person_8
It's just...I'm such a big fan.

Side_16
Oop.

Person_8
You guys were totally amazing at
the Battle of Weeping River.
Outnumbered a thousand to one, but
you didn't stop, and then you
just... HI-YAH!

Person_8
Ooo, sorry about that.

Side_16
Look, you don't belong here.

Person_8
I know. I know. You're right. I
just - my whole life I've dreamed
of-

Side_16
No no no... I meant you don't
belong here. I mean, in this room.
This is my room. Property of Crane.

Person_8
Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you
want to get to sleep.

Side_16
Yeah.

Person_8
I'm keepin' you up. We got big
things tomorrow. Alright. You're
awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say.
Okay. Bye bye.

Person_8
What was that?

Side_16
I didn't say anything.

Person_8
Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep
well.

Person_8
Seemed a little bit awkward.

Person_8
Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake
you. Just uh...

Person_7
You don't belong here.

Person_8
Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is
your room.

Person_7
I mean...you don't belong in the
Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to
Kung Fu, and if you have any
respect for who we are and what we
do, you will be gone by morning.

Person_8
Big fan...

Side_4
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

Person_8
Is that what this is? I am so
sorry. I thought it was just a
regular peach tree.

Side_4
I understand. You eat when you are
upset.

Person_8
Upset? I'm not upset. What makes
you think I'm upset?

Side_4
So why are you upset?

Person_8
I probably sucked more today than
anyone in the history of kung fu,
in the history of China, in the
history of sucking.

Side_4
Probably.

Person_8
And the Five... man, you should
have seen them, they totally hate
me.

Side_4
Totally.

Person_8
How's Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior? I mean,
I'm not like The Five. I've got no
claws, no wings, no venom. Even
Mantis has those...
(he imitates a mantis'
front legs)
...thingies. Maybe I should just
quit and go back to making noodles.

Side_4
Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't
noodles.

Side_4
You are too concerned with what was
and what will be. There is a
saying: Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
a gift. That is why it is called
the present.

Side_3
What's happening?!

Side_14
Fire Crossbows!

Side_3
Tai Lung is free! I must warn
Shifu!

Side_14
You're not going anywhere. And
neither is he.

Side_3
Let go of me!

Side_14
Bring it up!

Side_3
He's coming this way!

Side_14
He won't get far.
Archers!

Side_3
We're dead. So very, very dead.

Side_14
Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!

Side_3
Can we run now?

Side_14
Yes.

Side_3
Nuuu... Urggg...

Side_18
I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
beginning to think I had been
forgotten.

Side_18
Fly back there and tell them...the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

Side_13
Good morning master!

Side_2
Panda! Panda, wake up!

Side_2
Hmm. He's quit.

Side_17
What do we do now, Master? With the
panda gone, who will be the Dragon
Warrior?

Side_2
All we can do is resume our
training and trust that in time,
the true Dragon Warrior will be
revealed.

Side_2
What are you doing here?!

Person_8
Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I
thought I'd warm up a little.

Side_2
You're stuck.

Person_8
Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

Side_2
Help him.

Side_16
Oh dear.

Person_8
Maybe on three. One. Two-

Person_8
Threeeee. Thank you.

Side_16
Don't mention it.

Person_8
No really, I appreci--

Side_2
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one
night? It takes years to develop
one's flexibility and years longer
to apply it in combat.

Side_2
Put that down! The only souvenirs
we collect here are bloody knuckles
and broken bones.

Person_8
Yeah, excellent!

Side_2
Let's get started.

Side_17
Are you ready?

Person_8
I was born ready--

Person_8
Eaghhh...

Side_17
I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
said you were ready!

Person_8
That was awesome! Let's go again.

Side_2
I've been taking it easy on you,
panda, but no more! Your next
opponent... will be me.

Person_8
Alright! Let's go!

Side_2
Step forth.

Side_2
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness and make
him suffer for it.

Person_8
Oh, yeah!

Side_2
To take his strength and use it
against him.

Side_2
--until he finally falls, or quits.

Person_8
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry, Master, I will never
quit!

Person_7
If he's smart, he won't come back
up those steps.

Person_6
But he will.

Side_17
He's not gonna quit, is he?

Side_15
He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll
tell ya that.

Side_15
Trust me, it will. It's just not
easy finding the right nerve points
under all this--

Person_8
Fat?

Side_15
Fur, I was gonna say fur.

Person_8
Sure you were.

Side_15
Who am I to judge a warrior based
on his size? I mean -- look at me.

Side_15 (O.C.)
I'm over here.

Person_8
Ow!

Side_17
Maybe you should take a look at
this again.

Side_15
Oh! Okay.

Person_8
Ow! Don't...
Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master
Shifu's trying to inspire me and
all, but if I didn't know any
better, I'd say he was trying to
get rid of me.

Side_15
I know he can seem kind of
heartless--

Side_15
But, ya know, he wasn't always like
that.

Side_17
According to legend, there was once
a time when Master Shifu actually
used to smile.

Person_8
No.

Side_15
Yes.

Side_17
But that was before...

Person_8
Before what?

Person_7
Before Tai Lung.

Side_16
Uh yeah, we're not really supposed
to talk about him.

Person_7
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

Person_8
(trying to ease the
tension)
Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.

Person_8
He was a student, the first ever to
master the thousand...

Person_8
...scrolls of... kung fu... and...
then he turned bad... and now he's
in jail.

Person_7
He wasn't just a student.

Person_7
And now he has a chance to make
things right, to train the true
Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
you: a big, fat panda who treats it
like a joke.

Person_8
Doieeeee...

Person_7
Oh! That is it!

Side_15
Wait! My fault! I accidentally
tweaked his facial nerve.

Side_15
And may have also stopped his
heart.

Side_2
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
peace.

Side_2
Would whoever is making that
flapping sound, quiet down!

Side_2
Inner...

Side_2
Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
some good news right now.

Side_3
Uh...

Side_2
Master! Master!

Side_4
Hmmm?

Side_2
I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.

Side_4
Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

Side_2
Master, your vision...your vision
was right. Tai Lung has broken out
of prison. He's on his way!

Side_4
That is bad news...

Side_4
...If you do not believe that the
Dragon Warrior can stop him.

Side_2
The panda? Master, that panda is
not the Dragon Warrior.

Side_2
He wasn't even meant to be here --
it was an accident!

Side_4
There are no accidents.

Side_2
Yes, I know. You've said that
already. Twice.

Side_4
Well, that was no accident either.

Side_2
Thrice.

Side_4
My old friend, the panda will never
fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
until you let go of the illusion of
control.

Side_2
Illusion?

Side_4
Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
cannot make it blossom when it
suits me, nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

Side_2
But there are things we can
control.

Side_2
I can control when the fruit will
fall.

Side_2
And I can control--

Side_2
--where to plant the seed. That is
no illusion, Master.

Side_4
Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
that seed will grow to be a peach
tree. You may wish for an apple, or
an orange... but you will get a
peach.

Side_2
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

Side_4
Maybe it can. If you are willing to
guide it, to nurture it. To believe
in it.

Side_2
But how? How? I need your help,
Master.

Side_4
No, you just need to believe.
Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
will believe.

Side_2
I... I will try.

Side_4
Good. My time has come. You must
continue your journey without me.

Side_2
What... what are you..?

Side_2
Master, you can't leave me!

Side_4
You must believe.

Side_2
Master!

Person_8
...but you're a lousy tipper.

Side_16
Really? So... how'd you get out of
there alive?

Person_8
I mean, I didn't actually say that,
but I thought it... in my mind.

Person_8
If he... could read my mind, he'd
have been like, "What?"
Order up!

Person_8
Hope you like it.

Side_15
This is really good.

Person_8
No, c'mon.

Person_8
You should try my dad's secret
ingredient soup. He actually knows
the secret ingredient.

Side_17
What are you talking about? This is
amazing.

Side_16
Wow, you're a really good cook.

Side_15
I wish my mouth was bigger.

Person_6
Tigress, you gotta try this.

Person_7
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time on
nothing but the dew of a single
gingko leaf and the energy of the
universe.

Person_8
I guess my body doesn't know it's
the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna
need a lot more than dew. And, uh,
universe juice.

Person_8
What?

Side_15
Oh, nothing... Master Shifu!

Person_8
You will never be the Dragon
Warrior, unless you lose five
hundred pounds and brush your
teeth!

Person_8
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

Person_8
Work hard, Panda. And maybe,
someday... you will have ears like
mine.

Person_8
Ears. It's not working for you? I
thought they were pretty good.

Person_6
It's Shifu.

Person_8
Of course it's Shifu. What do you
think I'm doing?

Person_8
Ooh! Master Shifu!

Side_2
You think this is funny? Tai Lung
has escaped from prison and you're
acting like children!

Person_8
What?

Side_2
He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,
and you are the only one who can
stop him.

Person_8
And here I am saying you got no
sense of humor. I'm gonna stop
Tai...

Person_8
What? You're serious? And I have to--
uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He
did it before, he'll do it again.

Side_2
Oogway cannot, not anymore.

Side_2
Our only hope is the Dragon
Warrior.

Person_7
The panda?

Side_2
Yes, the panda!

Person_7
Master, please. Let us stop Tai
Lung. This is what you've trained
us for.

Side_2
No! It is not your destiny to
defeat Tai Lung. It is his.

Side_2
Where'd he go?

Side_2
You cannot leave! A real warrior
never quits!

Person_8
Watch me!

Person_8
Come on! How am I supposed to beat
Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to
the stairs.

Side_2
You will beat him because you are
the Dragon Warrior!

Person_8
Ow! You don't believe that! You
never believed that! From the first
moment I got here, you've been
trying to get rid of me.

Side_2
Yes. I was. But now I ask you to
trust in your master as I have come
to trust in mine.

Person_8
You're not my master. And I'm not
the Dragon Warrior.

Side_2
Then why didn't you quit? You knew
I was trying to get rid of you, and
yet you stayed.

Person_8
Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because
every time you threw a brick at my
head or said I smelled, it hurt.
But it could never hurt more than
it did every day of my life just
being me.

Person_8
I stayed because I thought if
anyone could change me, could make
me... not me, it was you. The
greatest kung fu teacher in all of
China.

Side_2
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior! And I
will!

Person_8
C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here
right now. And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here, how
are you gonna change this...
...into the Dragon Warrior? How?
How? How?!

Side_2
I don't know!!!
I don't know.

Person_8
That's what I thought.

Person_7
This is what you trained me for.

Side_17
Tigress!

Person_7
Don't try and stop me!

Side_17
We're not trying to stop you!

Person_7
What?

Side_17
We're coming with you!

Person_8
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?

Side_2
Oh, no need to explain. I just
thought you might be Monkey -- he
hides his almond cookies on the top
shelf.

Person_8
Don't tell Monkey.

Side_2
Look at you.

Person_8
Yeah, I know. I disgust you.

Side_2
No no, I mean... how did you get up
there?

Person_8
I don't know. I guess I-- I don't
know. I was getting a cookie...

Side_2
And yet you are ten feet off the
ground and have done a perfect
split.

Person_8
No, this... this is just an
accident.

Side_2
There are no accidents. Come with
me.

Person_8
I know you're trying to be all
mystical and kung fu-y, but could
you at least tell me where we're
going?

Person_8
You dragged me all the way out here
for a bath?!

Side_2
Panda, we do not wash our pits in
The Pool of Sacred Tears.

Person_8
The pool of...

Side_2
This is where Oogway unravelled the
mysteries of harmony and focus.
This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.

Side_2
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

Person_8
Yeah...

Side_2
Then I am your master!

Person_8
Okay!

Side_2
Don't cry.

Person_8
Okay.

Side_2
When you focus on Kung Fu, when you
concentrate...you stink.

Side_2
But perhaps that is my fault. I
cannot train you the way I have
trained the Five. I now see that
the way to get through to you is
with this!

Person_8
Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.

Side_2
Good. When you have been trained,
you may eat. Let us begin.

Side_2
After you, panda.

Person_8
Just like that? No situps? No ten
mile hike?

Side_2
I vowed to train you... and you
have been trained. You are free to
eat.

Side_2
Enjoy.

Person_8
Hey!

Side_2
I said you are free to eat. Have a
dumpling.

Person_8
Hey!

Side_2
You are free to eat!

Person_8
Am I?

Side_2
Are you?!

Person_8
I'm not hungry... master.

Person_7
Cut it!

Side_18
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

Person_7
How do you know you're not looking
at her?

Side_18
You think I'm a fool? I know you're
not the Dragon Warrior. None of
you!

Side_18
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire, that he's a
warrior unlike anything the world
has ever seen.

Person_6
Po?

Side_18
So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
a worthy opponent. Our battle will
be legendary!

Person_6
We've got this. Help her!

Side_17
Monkey!

Side_15
Go!
Ack! What was I thinking?!

Person_7
Mantis!

Person_7
Now!

Side_18
Shifu taught you well...

Side_18
But he didn't teach you everything.

Side_2
You have done well, Panda.

Person_8
Done well? Done well?! I've done
awesome!

Side_2
The mark of a true hero is
humility!

Side_2
But yes...you have done awesome.

Person_8
Huh? Guys? Guys!

Person_8
They're dead? No, they're
breathing! They're asleep?! No,
their eyes are open.

Side_16
We were no match for his nerve
attack.

Side_2
He has gotten stronger.

Person_8
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

Person_6
He's too fast!

Person_6
Sorry, Po.

Person_7
I thought we could stop him.

Side_2
He could have killed you.

Side_15
Why didn't he?

Side_2
So you could come back here and
strike fear into our hearts. But it
won't work!

Person_8
Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
pretty scared.

Side_2
You can defeat him, panda.

Person_8
Are you kidding? If they can't--
They're five masters. I'm just one
me.

Side_2
But you will have the one thing
that no one else does.

Person_8
You really believe I'm ready?

Side_2
You are, Po.

Side_2
Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
yours.

Person_8
Wait, what happens when I read it?

Side_2
No one knows, but legend says you
will be able to hear a butterfly's
wing-beat.

Person_8
Whoa! Really? That's cool.

Side_2
Yes. And see light in the deepest
cave. You will feel the universe in
motion around you.

Person_8
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?
Will I have invisibility--

Side_2
Focus. Focus.

Person_8
Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.

Side_2
Read it, Po, and fulfill your
destiny. Read it and become... the
Dragon Warrior!

Person_8
Whooaa!!!

Person_8
It's impossible to open.

Person_8
Come on baby. Come on now...

Person_8
Thank you. I probably loosened it
up for you though... Okay, here
goes.

Person_8
It's blank!

Side_2
What?

Person_8
Here! Look!

Side_2
No! I am forbidden to look upon--

Side_2
Blank? I don't...I don't
understand.

Person_8
Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
crazy old turtle after all?

Side_2
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

Person_8
Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
by accident. Of course I'm not the
Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?

Person_7
But who will stop Tai Lung?

Side_16
He'll destroy everything...and
everyone.

Side_2
No, evacuate the Valley. You must
protect the villagers from Tai
Lung's rage.

Person_7
What about you master?

Side_2
I will fight him.

Person_8
What?

Side_2
I can hold him off long enough for
everyone to escape.

Person_8
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

Side_2
Then I will finally have paid for
my mistake.

Side_2
Listen to me, all of you. It is
time for you to continue your
journey without me. I am very proud
to have been your master.

Person_7
We've got to get them out safely.

Person_6
Come, little one. Let's find your
mama.

Person_7
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
way.

Side_8
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

Person_8
Hey, Dad.

Person_8'S DAD
Po!

Person_8'S DAD
Good to have you back, son!

Person_8
Good to be back.

Person_8'S DAD
Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
it's time to face it -- the future
of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
no longer slices.

Person_8'S DAD
Also, I was thinking, maybe this
time we'll have a kitchen you can
actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
that?

Person_8'S DAD
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
out. It just... wasn't meant to be.

Person_8'S DAD
Po, forget everything else. Your
destiny still awaits. We are noodle
folk -- broth runs deep through our
veins.

Person_8
I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm
actually your son.

Person_8'S DAD
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you a
long time ago...

Person_8
Okay.

Person_8'S DAD
The secret ingredient of my secret
ingredient soup!

Person_8
Oh.

Person_8'S DAD
C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
nothing!

Person_8
Huh?

Person_8'S DAD
You heard me. Nothing. There is no
secret ingredient!

Person_8
Wait wait...it's just plain old
noodle soup? You don't add some
kind of special sauce or something?

Person_8'S DAD
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just have to believe
it's special.

Person_8
There is no secret ingredient...

Side_18
I have come home, Master.

Side_2
This is no longer your home. And I
am no longer your master.

Side_18
Yes. You have a new favorite. So
where is this...Po? Did I scare him
off?

Side_2
This battle is between you and me.

Side_18
So. That is how it's going to be?

Side_2
That is how it must be.

Side_18
I rotted in jail for twenty years
because of your weakness!

Side_2
Obeying your master is not
weakness!

Side_18
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
You always knew...

Side_2
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

Side_2
It was never my decision to make!

Side_18
It is now.

Side_18
Give me the scroll!

Side_2
I would rather die.

Side_18
All I ever did, I did to make you
proud! Tell me how proud you are,
Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!

Side_2
I have always been proud of you.
From the first moment, I've been
proud of you. And it was my pride
that blinded me. I loved you too
much to see what you were becoming.
What I was turning you into. I'm...
sorry.

Side_18
I don't want your apology. I want
my scroll!

Side_2
Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
halfway across China by now. You
will never see that scroll, Tai
Lung. Never. Never...

Person_8
Stairs...

Side_18
Who are you?

Person_8
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
Huhhh...

Side_18
You?! Him?!
He's a panda.
You're a panda. What are you gonna
do, big guy? Sit on me?

Person_8
Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
use this. You want it? Come and get
it.

Side_18
Finally!

Side_18
That scroll is mine!

Person_8
Lightning!

Side_18
The scroll has given him power.

Side_18
Finally... oh yes... the power of
the Dragon Scroll... is mine!

Side_18
It's NOTHING!!

Person_8
It's okay. I didn't get it the
first time either.

Side_18
What?

Person_8
There is no secret ingredient. It's
just you.

Person_8
Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
Don't! Don't!

Side_18
You... can't defeat me. You're just
a big, fat panda!

Person_8
I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
big, fat panda.

Side_18
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

Person_8
Oh, you know this hold?

Side_18
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that.

Person_8
Nope. I figured it out.

Person_8
Skadoosh!

Side_7
Look! The Dragon Warrior.

Person_8'S DAD
That's my boy. That big, lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

Person_8
Thanks, Dad.

Person_8
Hey, guys.

Person_7
Master.

Side_13
Master.

Person_8
Master?
Master Shifu!

Person_8
Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?

Side_2
Po! You're alive!
Or we're both dead.

Person_8
No, Master, I didn't die. I
defeated Tai Lung!

Side_2
You did?!

Side_2
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
You are the Dragon Warrior. You
have brought peace to this Valley.
And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
Po. Thank you...

Person_8
No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
Shifu. Please...

Side_2
I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
peace. Finally.

Person_8
Oh. So, um, I should...stop
talking?

Side_2
If you can.

Person_8
Want to get something to eat?

Side_2
Yeah.

Person_1
No one knows where it came from.
There had been others. Mysterious
relics of another world. But only
one with the power to stop the
world.

Person_1
Many vied for its dark magic. A
few brave souls endeavoured to
hide it from those who would use
it for ill. Until finally,
thankfully it was lost to history.

Person_1
Ours is a story of a world that
knows not where it comes from.
That cannot imagine what it is
capable of. Perhaps you can
relate. I know I can.

Person_2
The Black Falcon. I should've
known.

Person_3
Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this
place? Must have been a bunch of
lazy hippies, sitting around a
table agreeing with each other.

Person_2
It was built by the ancients.
With more wisdom and artistry than
you can ever know.

Person_3
The Kragle...

Person_2
That belongs to the Maker. It
must be protected!

Person_3
What a lame boyscout thing to say!
You're standing before the most
powerful object in the world and
you don't want to use it? You're a
real nerd, Indiana Jones.

Person_2
The MasterBuilders will learn of
this.

Person_3
And what do you know of them?

Person_2
Only that they will be your
undoing.

Person_3
Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French
for ciao.

Person_2
The Black Falcon has the Kragle.

Person_4
Gemini. Find the Chosen One.

Person_5
Okay.

Person_2
They followed me...

Person_6
Emmet!

Person_6
Did you clean your room?! The
cleaning woman is coming today!

Person_6
Because I want her to know what a
nice rule-following son I have!

Person_7
Mom!

Person_6
Aw, it is clean.

Person_7
It's always clean!

Person_7
What's the point of having my own
apartment across the hall from
your apartment if you're going to
check up on me like I still live
at home?

Person_6
I just love you and want my son to
be safe and happy. Can't you work
from home? Like a sociopath or
children's book author?

Person_7
Mom. I've spent my whole life
here. I need to go out there and
follow my dream of fitting in and
being like everybody else.

Person_6
My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon
you'll meet a girl and be married!

Person_7
Mom, please!

Person_6
I'm just saying, it's been how
many years since Lucy?

Person_7
Mom... I had the dream again.

Person_8
Emmet. This wasn't the assignment.
You've got to learn to follow the
rules.

Person_8
Everyone, the assignment is to
draw your hand, not a silly face.

Person_9
That's the guys who drew a face. /
What a weirdo. / He doesn't know
how to follow instructions. / He's
not invited to my birthday.

Person_6
I hated that day. The kids were so
mean, the school tried to expel
you... I promised myself I'd never
let anything like that happen to
you again. And it hasn't. So you
need to let your memory of that
day go. It never happened.

Person_7
I just want to be normal, Mom.

Person_6
Listen. You're my son. And you're
the most normal, regular, average
person I know.

Person_7
You mean it?

Person_6
Yeah.

Person_7
Are you crying?

Person_6
No. Yes. Emmet...

Person_6
Don't forget dinner.

Person_7
Promise.

Person_6
Be safe.

Person_7
Of course.

Person_6
Don't make waves.

Person_7
I never do.

Person_6
And follow the instructions.

Person_7
Always.

Person_6
If they weren't so firm and flush
with your head, I would pinch your
cheeks right now.

Person_7
Love you, Mom.

Person_6
Love you.

Person_7
Yeah. I love this song! And so
does everyone else!

Person_7
Hello.

Side_2
What'll it be?

Person_7
I'm Emmet.

Side_2
Larry?

Person_7
Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee
please.

Side_2
Cappuccino, macchiato, espresso,
americano.

Person_7
What are those? Sounds a little
foofy.

Side_2
They're all coffee.

Person_7
Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild.
I don't know, what do you think?

Side_2
A decaf.

Person_7
Okay, yeah. Cool.

Side_2
Venti, Grande, or Super Grande?

Person_7
Oh, goodness. So much selection.
So hard to decide! You pick.

Side_2
That's a personal decision that
only you can make.

Person_7
Uh. Gosh, which is the most
popular?

Side_2
Super Grande. It's Italian for
medium.

Person_7
Medium. That's what I'm havin'!
That is my style.

Side_2
Fantastic.

Person_7
You creative types! So
delightfully sardonic!

Side_2
I push one of two buttons on a
machine. I would hardly call that
creative. I would call that
following instructions.

Person_7
But it says Kreative right on your
shirt! With an extra "kreative"
spelling aberration! I totally
don't get it!

Side_3
Alright, kid. Here's the rules.

Person_7
Ooh, great.

Side_3
Stay on your feet--

Person_7
Mmm hmm.

Side_3
Stick to the instructions--

Person_7
Uh huh.

Side_3
And don't get creative!

Person_7
Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not
some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!

Side_3
It's Sean.

Side_3
The pieces get sent down from
corporate bundled together with
the instructions. Take the one
with your section on it and follow
it to the letter. Keep track of
all the pieces. If you lose one of
the special ones it'll seriously
drive you crazy.

Side_3
Today you'll be putting together
an artists' loft.

Person_7
Is it for an artist?

Side_3
Oh, no. It's for an accountant.

Person_7
Oh, great.

Side_3
Pretty soon, the whole city will
look like this. All part of some
big master plan from Central.

Person_7
Wow...

Person_7
What if I mess up or lose my place
or something?

Side_3
Just do what everyone else does.
Keep your head down, follow
instructions, and you could get
promoted. Central's got some big
project coming up overseas.

Person_7
Overseas? I don't know. I'm not
big on travel.

Side_3
Whatever, kid.

Person_7
One more question.

Person_7
Thank you. For making my dreams
come true.

Side_3
Is that a question?

Person_7
So.

Person_7
How about that local sports team?
What do you think of how they
played the other day?

Side_4
Ugh, they were awful.

Person_7
Right? They should make a
personnel change of some kind.

Person_7
Yes, the coach!

Side_4
He's the only good thing about
that team.

Person_7
They should so keep him!

Side_4
We're all going to watch the game
after work. Eat a little grub.
Want to join?

Person_7
Really?!
Actually, I'm supposed to have
dinner with my-- What the heck?
I'm in.

Side_4
Alright then.

Person_7
Cool. Definitely cool.
Hey did you hear that song on the
way in to work this morning?

Side_4
Everything is Awesome? I love
that song.

Side_5
Me too!

Person_7
I think I know why I like that
song so much.

Side_4
Why's that?

Person_7
Because everything is awesome.

Side_4S
Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never
thought of it like that.

Side_3
Kid! What the heck is that?!

Person_7
Oh, uh. I don't know. What?

Side_3
That's not the instructions.

Person_7
I don't know what happened. I was
just looking out at the clouds,
and-- It was an accident.

Person_7
Code Danger? What's so dangerous?

Person_7
Oh.

Side_7
Loose brick!

Side_7'S PARTNER
Loose brick!

Side_9
Stop that building!

Person_7
--unbelievably sorry. I am
honestly the last person who would
do something like thi--

Person_7
--eriously, a model citizen. I
got straight As. I vote! Even in
the off-year elections, for school
board and stuff--

Person_7
--swear, I'm not special at all.
Just ask my mom! I'm a totally
average normal person!

Side_10
Oh yeah? What size coffee do you
drink?

Person_7
Super grande.

Side_10
Dammit! I can't break him.

Person_7
You don't need to break me! I'm
just a regular old totally

Person_7
I'm Emmet. What's your name?

Side_11
...we're still following the story
of the construction worker who got
a little creative on his first day
on the job. The subject was
described as looking and acting
exactly like everybody else...
Police have taken the nondescript
suspect into custody, and he is
being held in the city jail.

Person_7
Mom? What are you doing here?

Person_6
I'm breaking you out.

Person_7
But, that's breaking the rules.
You told me never to do that.

Person_6
Well I'm temporarily reversing my
position for reasons of
convenience.

Person_7
What?

Person_6
The rules are different now.

Person_7
But I did something really bad.

Person_6
No you didn't.

Person_7
Mom. You taught me to be a person
of principle, and I stand by my
principles of doing whatever
authority tells me to.

Person_6
Great. Fine. Would you mind
holding my purse?

Person_7
Sure.

Person_7
Wh-- what are you doing?

Person_6
Saving your life.

Person_7
Where did you get a blowdart?

Person_6
That's not important.

Person_7
Half my body is numb! My hand is
stuck shut! That seems important!

Person_6
I just broke you out of prison!

Person_7
For a misdemeanor! They didn't
even decide how long I'd be in
there for yet.

Person_6
They won't ever decide. You don't

Person_7
You don't understand! I was
having the best day of my life
today. I was one of the guys. We
were going to go to a dinner and
talk about life and stuff--

Person_6
You were supposed to have dinner
with me.

Person_7
I was going to call.

Person_6
Well it feels amazing to spend
twenty years loving and protecting
someone and the first day out of
the nest they wind up on the news.

Person_7
I made a mistake. I'll explain it
to the judge tomorrow and
everything will be fine. Only it
won't because I can't because
suddenly I am an ESCAPED FUGITIVE!

Person_6
It's for your own good.

Person_7
You can't protect me my whole
life.

Person_6
You wanna bet? Come on.

Person_7
Mom, I'm going back to jail to
repay my debt to society. A
society that I would like to be a
part of.

Person_6
You have to trust me--

Person_7
You have to trust me! I'm my own
person. You have to let me grow
up and make my own choices--

Person_6
I tried, and look what happened!

Person_7
Maybe if you didn't mother me so
much I'd have been a little better
equipped. Ever think of that?

Person_6
As a matter of fact I did. All
the time.

Person_7
Ugh. You know what you are, Mom?
You want to really know? A real
pain in the elbow!

Person_6
Emmet!

Person_7
Mom? Mom!!!!

Person_5
Where did she go?!

Person_7
What's happening?!

Person_7
How did you--

Person_7
My mom got kidnapped by ninjas
then a lady turned a mailbox into
a motorcycle and now we have to
catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.

Side_2
Get in, I guess?

Side_2
What's with the purse?

Person_6
What do you want with me?!

Person_6
You have the wrong person!

Person_7
Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm
going to save you!

Person_5
Stop, Emmet! You're going to
screw everything up!

Person_7
No, I'm not! How do you know my
name?

Side_12
What the FLIPPING FLIP IS

Person_7
You're breaking the speed limit,
you know. Not to mention several
other laws, as a well as a few
other things that are not written
into law per se, but are accepted
social practices.

Person_5
Emmet.

Person_7
Lucy?

Side_13
It's Gemini now.

Person_7
Are you a DJ?

Side_13
No.

Person_7
So, uh, how have the last seven
years been?

Side_13
Okay.

Person_6
Emmet?!
Don't you dare hurt him.

Person_7
So. I have a lot of questions.

Side_13
Is this really the best time to
talk?

Person_7
Well, so far...

Side_13
Fine. Shoot.

Person_7
Why did those ninjas take my mom?
Why are there ninjas? Are they
robotic ninjas? Where have you
been the last seven years? When
did you gain magical superpowers?
Why did you change your name to
Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you
ask me. Also, have you been
following me around this whole
time? Because that's pretty weird
considering last time I saw you
was when you dumped me for
absolutely no reason.

Side_2
You guys used to date? Nice.

Side_13
Hardly.

Person_7
Oh try all of 8th grade!

Side_2
Burn.

Side_13
By the way, I'm seeing someone
now, so don't get any ideas.

Person_7
I never have any ideas.

Person_7
Oh, thank goodness, the police are
here.

Person_7
Never mind.

Side_13
You don't get it, do you?

Person_7
Get what?

Side_13
They're here for the Chosen One.

Person_7
The Chosen One? What the heck is
that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep
telling everyone- I'm just a
regular guy!

Side_13
Not you. Your mom.

Person_7
Oh. Really?

Side_13
I was sent to get her, but they
got to her first.

Person_7
You're sure I'm not the Chosen
One?

Side_13
Emmet, your mother is the most
powerful being in the universe.

Person_7
But-- how-- she has cankles!

Side_13
Don't we all.

Side_13
She and I belong to an ancient
brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who
create from our imaginations, not
instructions, forced underground
by evil forces. She has long been
in hiding to protect you from
those forces. I was sent to summon
her, but when I showed up she was
too busy breaking you out of
prison.

Person_7
Okay I did not understand a lot of
that.

Side_13
Just hold the wheel.

Side_13
How... Emmet! Jump!

Person_7
Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Side_13
It didn't break. How?

Person_7
She's gone. I can't believe she's
gone... because she tried to
protect me...?

Side_10
Send everyone you can out hunting
for that kid and whoever is trying
to help him. You hear me?!
He's wanted... broken or together.

Side_12
I need a coffee.

Person_7
Who exactly are these evil forces
my mom was trying to protect me
from? And why are the cops in
league with robot ninjas?

Side_13
You have a lot of questions.

Person_7
I'm just getting warmed up.

Side_13
They all work for the Black
Falcon.

Person_7
The Black Falcon?

Side_13
Otherwise known as Rodrigo
Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?

Person_7
Empura? I love their stuff.

Side_13
He is also the self-declared
Emperor of all known LEGO realms.
He kidnapped your mom because she
is the only one who can stop him
from destroying us all.

Person_7
My mom. My mom?

Side_13
Emmet, did your mom have a safe
deposit box, a safe, something
where she would have hidden
something very valuable?

Person_7
No. The only thing she had that
was worth anything was her purse.
She takes it with her everywhere.
Unfortunately it's now melted to
my arm. Ow!

Side_13
No...no...no...no...no...no...
No...no...no...no...no...no...

Person_7
Well, I guess it's not in there--

Side_13
No...no...no...no...no...no...

Side_13
It's not in there.

Side_13
What's her birthday?

Person_7
November twenty-second.

Side_13
Of course. Your birthday.
January six.

Side_13
Not by choice.

Side_13
The MasterPiece.

Person_7
What is this thing? It's...
beautiful.

Side_13
Some say it's the first piece
ever. No one knows exactly what it
does, but it is said the Chosen
One will use it to one day save
the world.

Person_7
And by that you mean my mom.

Side_13
There's an inscription.

Person_7
One will come from land afar,
With hand besmirched in shape of star.
One to confront a great forsaker,
And build a bridge to meet the Maker.
This one will make the world right,
But first there'll be an awesome fight.

Side_13
The prophecy of the Chosen One...

Person_7
Who is my Mom.

Side_13
Yes. We have to get this to your
mom so she can fulfill her destiny
and stop the Black Falcon before
he destroys us all.

Person_7
And if it weren't for me, she'd be
here and everything would be okay.

Side_14
Finn? I thought I told you not to
touch anything...

Person_7
What was that?

Side_13
What was what?

Side_13
We have to go. NOW.

Person_7
Where are we going?!

Side_13
We're going to take the MasterPiece
to someone who can help.

Person_7
The MasterBuilders council?

Side_13
No. They're gone. All of them.

Person_7
Then who?

Side_13
Vitruvius. He was once a great
MasterBuilder, now he's...retired.
But he's our only hope.

Person_7
Can't you do it on your own? You
were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!

Side_13
I can't, I'm...still in training.
I'm not a full-fledged
MasterBuilder yet. Technically,
I'm an intern.

Person_7
Well well well--

Person_7
You're not going to cross the city
limits, are you?

Side_13
Don't be a putz, Emmet.

Person_7
Everyone knows you're not allowed
to go Out of Town. It's dangerous,
uncharted and no one should ever go
that's what everybody says. Can't
we just explain the situation to
President Iamnotarobot?

Side_13
Iamnotarobot is one of the Black
Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever
notice how metallic he looks?

Person_7
Come on. He's just very fair
skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot"
in his very name! Besides, he's
way better than Councilman
Strawman. That guy is the pits.

Side_13
Don't be nave.

Person_7
What's nave?

Side_13
That.

Side_13
Look, just give me the MasterPiece
and I'll take it from here.

Person_7
My mom gave it to me and I'm not
giving it to anyone unless their
name is My Mom.

Side_13
Well then I guess you're going to
have to cross that line.

Person_7
Well then I guess I am.

Side_13
Well then go ahead and do it.

Person_7
Well then go ahead and do it I
shall.

Side_13
Dude!

Person_7
Okay, okay.

Side_13
Not everything is what it seems...

Person_7
Who are those guys?

Side_13
Annoying short whiners. Plus they
reproduce like crazy. It's a real
problem.

Person_7
Where are we? Where are all the
buildings? And coffee shops?

Side_13
Legopolis is only one realm in the
Black Falcon's dominion. He built
walls around all of them so he can
keep them separate. If the walls
came down, he'd have a hard time
controlling the results. The
MasterBuilders built secret
passages through the walls so we
could travel between lands.

Person_7
Who are they?

Side_13
The Black Falcon's sentries.
They're looking for us.

Person_7
So he controls all these worlds?

Side_13
Shh!

Side_15
The Black Falcon will see you now.

Person_3
Doris! Did someone get you a
water?

Person_6
You'll never get away with this.

Person_3
"You'll never get away with this!"
What a clich! You don't even know
what it is I'm trying to get away
with. Maybe you should listen
more.

Person_6
I'm all ears.

Person_3
Truly? Because listening and
hearing are not the same thing.

Person_6
I'm listening.

Person_3
Excellent.
Behold, the Kragle!

Person_6
The car in the city. That's why
it didn't break...

Person_3
Very good. But there's a lot more
to my plan than that. Check it:

Person_3
Here is your typical family. You
there. Move your arm a little
higher. A little higher... NO NO
NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are
all PATHETIC LOSERS!

Person_3
Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an
inch. You see how hard it is for
me? I have to make all these plans
and rules and enforce them on
people. It's whack-a-mole. I get
one thing perfect, and then
another thing gets messed up. Ay
ay ay I get so tired!

Person_6
You never did understand the way
of the Maker.

Person_3
Sure I do. There's one right way
to do everything, and I know it,
and everyone else is wrong and is
trying to screw me up! Until now.

Person_3
You. Introduce yourselves to me.

Side_16
I'm sorry?

Person_3
Like, you say to me "Hello Black
Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my
wife Mary and our children Mark
and Lisa."

Side_16
But you just said it.

Person_3
Well, just-- you say it now.

Side_16
Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, this

Person_3
My wife Mary.

Person_3
And our children...

Side_16
And our kids--

Person_3
Children.

Side_16
And our children Mark and Lisa.

Person_3
All together now.

Side_16
< SIGH > Hello Black Falcon I'm
Dale, this is my wife Mary and our
children Mark and Lisa.

Person_3
Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and
Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm
very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!

Person_3
Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA!
And it's totally permanent!

Person_6
You want to do this to the whole
world?

Person_3
So the whole world will be exactly
how I want.

Person_6
But-- I'll never see my son again.
No mother will ever see her son.

Person_3
Unless they're frozen when they
happen to be looking at each
other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so
glad we could finally meet again,
after all these years.

Person_6
What do you want from me?

Person_3
Isn't it obvious? I want you to
make me a better Kragle-Thingy!

Person_6
That's really dumb.

Person_3
I mean this works okay, but it
doesn't have a wide enough spray.
I need to make like a big cloud of
sticky mist. And it's not scary
enough. And I hate the color.

Person_6
You'll never get aw-- You'll not
achieve that which you have just
described!

Person_3
What, do you think your pathetic
son is going to save you or
something? He can't even put two
bricks together.

Person_3
Did you? I think you protected
him. Because you were afraid to
have him live under the spectre of
being found out. Of being hunted.
You wanted him to fit in. To feel
normal, isn't that right?

Person_3
Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to
that call, he's going to get his
butt kicked. He'll fit in,
alright. Into a coffin!

Person_6
Leave him out of this!

Person_3
I would, but I'm pretty sure he
has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in
your apartment, and it's not on
you. But your son seems to have
interesting taste in handbags.

Person_3
So, just to tie up all the loose
ends, I'll have to kill him and
take the MasterPiece so the
prophecy will never come true.

Person_6
No! Don't, please! I'll do what
you want, please don't hurt him.

Person_3
Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do
what I want regardless. I'll
simply use my very special
electromagnetic machine to extract
your thoughts and steal your ideas
like I've done for all the other
imprisoned MasterBuilders.

Person_6
No!

Person_3
Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!

Person_7
Is it much farther?

Side_13
Do you ever say something that
isn't a stupid question?

Person_7
What's that supposed to mean?

Side_13
I guess not.

Side_13
That's Dragon.

Person_7
Who could live here?

Side_13
A blind man.

Side_17
Hello! What? Hi!

Person_7
I see.

Person_7
Lovely place.

Side_17
Thank you. I am deprived of my
sight, but my hearing is so acute
that I can still perceive the
physical world using echolocation.

Person_7
Like an old bat...

Side_17
Precisely. I see with my ears.
Now, how can I help you, extremely
tall and fat stranger?

Person_7
My mother has been kidnapped and
it's all my fault.

Side_17
Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.

Side_13
His mother is the Chosen One. I
was sent to summon her. The Black
Falcon got to her first. He has
the Kragle.

Side_17
Oh my. That is grave news indeed.
But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm
sure the active MasterBuilders are
more than adequate.

Side_13
The other MasterBuilders are gone.

Side_17
I guess I'm not redundant anymore.

Person_7
Why is he being so weird?

Side_17
The Black Falcon was my student.

Side_18
Hey Rod. What's that?

Side_19
An awesome secret lair, b'doy!
It's the best thing I've ever
built. It's perfect. All I need
now is a cool nickname.

Side_19
No! My precious precious work!

Side_20
Building is rebuilding, Rodrigo.
You must learn to embrace the
practice, not the outcome.

Side_19
What a bunch of bunk! That thing
was AWESOME!

Side_17
They were probably right.

Person_7
You taught my parents...

Side_17
Your mother went into hiding to
protect you. Your father never had
a chance...

Side_13
Vitruvius, you can still help us.

Side_17
That's flattery, my dear. We both
know you're only here because you
have no other place to go.

Person_7
We're here because we don't know
what to do and you might. Sir, all
I've ever wanted was to get along
with everyone and be a part of the
world and now I don't know if
there's going to be a world to be
a part of. That is, unless you
help me fix it. And I bet if you
do, they'll forget all about what
they used to think of you.

Side_17
I wish I could, young man, but he
has the Kragle, and he has the
Chosen One, and if he has the
Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece.
And without that, there is no--

Side_13
Hope?

Side_17
The Kragle is the most powerful
relic of the Maker.

Person_7
Who is this Maker you guys keep
talking about?

Side_17
The Maker. The being who put us
all together and watches over us.
Only by following the inspiration
of the Maker can one become a true
MasterBuilder.

Person_7
Okay that sounds super weird.

Side_17
It is, but then all the best
things are.

Person_7
And what's the Kragle again?

Side_17
Every so often, the Maker drops a
piece down to us that is unique,
unlike any other. This crystal
table is but one example. Some of
them, in the wrong hands, can be
weaponized. The Kragle, if
harnessed, could--

Person_7
--destroy the world?

Side_17
Yes. The Black Falcon has taken
your mother, the one person who
can stop him, and imprisoned her.

Side_17
If we can travel across sea and
land, penetrate his heavily-
guarded fortress, unkidnap Master
Doris, and bring the MasterPiece
safely to her, she can use it to
destroy the Kragle, and set the
world right.

Person_7
Oh is that all we have to do? That
doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I
forgot to mention, I am saying
this with a sarcastic inflection.

Side_13
That's super constructive, thank
you.

Side_17
We need to assemble a team of all
remaining MasterBuilders hiding
throughout the lands. We'll scour
the countryside high and low,
overturning rocks, hiding from
sentries, avoiding the major roads
and air..

Side_13
We don't have that kind of time!

Side_17
Or we could send out a mass email
to the MasterBuilders list, and
have whichever ones are remaining
meet us at the midpoint.

Person_7
Better.

Side_17
And then, we sail for the Land of
Unused Parts!
Anybody got a ship?

Person_7
How long has your boyfriend had
his own ship?

Side_13
Why do you care?

Person_7
I just think it's interesting that
you're attracted to someone with
his own vessel. Fairly superficial
to date a guy with his own yacht.

Side_13
It's not exactly a yacht.

Side_21
Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!

Person_7
Huh. Not what I expected.

Person_7
Really not what I expected.

Side_21
Arr! Come give your weary
boyfriend a kiss!

Person_7
Wow.

Person_7
Okay. That's-- okay.

Side_13
Gosh, where are my manners?
Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my
boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is
Emmet. We used to date a million
zillion years ago. It meant
nothing to me. You have heard of
Vitruvius, of course.

Side_21
You're the teacher that made the
Black Falcon who he is, then?

Side_17
That was a long time ago.

Side_21
Farrr be it for a pirate to judge
a man with an unsavory reputation.

Person_7
That's surprisingly gracious--

Side_21
Stay away from me lady.

Person_7
Alright. Sure.

Side_21
Say that to my face.

Person_7
Alright. Sure.

Side_21
I was once the most feared
MasterBuilder in all the lands. I
lost the rest of me body fighting
off a hundred of the Black Falcon's
men. You cross me, and I'll make it
an even fight, if you follow.

Person_7
Thank you for your clarity.

Side_13
He has an incredible mind.

Side_21
Everyone hop aboard. Meet me crew.
This be Orangebeard, Brownbeard
and Nobeard, and me First Mate,
Chewbacca. You can call him
Allbeard.

Side_21
The route be stuffed to the gills
with Empura shipping activity.
It's heavily patrolled. We'll
have to be keeping an eye open,
and when the time be right, make
ourrrr move.

Person_7
What's our move?

Side_21
I'm sorry, did the Captain say you
could finish swabbing the deck?

Side_17
Lucy. Welcome.

Person_7
It's Emmet.

Side_17
Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?

Person_7
Yes. What are you doing?

Side_17
Making.

Person_7
What's it for?

Side_17
What is anything for? It's what
we were all meant to do. What the
Maker has fated us to do.

Person_7
Okay, here's what I don't get. If
our lives really are predetermined
by some all-controlling dude, what
is the point of doing anything?

Person_7
OW! Why did you do that?!

Side_17
The Maker fated me to.

Person_7
Or you did it yourself because
you're a crazy person.

Side_17
Ah. Now, you're learning.

Person_7
I could just never make something
like that. How did you even get
the idea?

Side_17
I didn't. I just opened a window
for it to fly through.

Side_17
Birds are, incidentally, one of
the most creative of all the
animals. They build nests.
Create elaborate courtship
rituals, make gifts for one
another. And of course, their
beautiful songs.

Person_7
Teach me.

Side_17
Open your throat and make a
sound.

Person_7
No. Teach me to do what you do.

Side_17
How can I teach you something you
already know? It's already inside
you. You've walled it up, but it
still shines through. That
terrific disaster you caused at
the instruction site? That was no
accident.

Person_7
I'm not sure I follow...

Side_17
They say every night the Maker
puts a blanket over the world, a
blanket with tiny holes. Some call
them stars, but I call them
MakerPeepers.

Person_7
MakerPeepers?

Side_17
MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a
time, before you were born, when
making new things came as
naturally to everyone as
breathing. The world was messy and
wild, and that made it beautiful.
But then, everything became rigid
and prefabricated, so everyone
just stopped thinking of new
things. Making has been outsourced
to Empura. The Black Falcon has
paved over the world that was.

Side_17
And yet, somehow, light still
shines through the cracks.

Person_7
Oh no! Wait!
It got out...

Side_17
Isn't that marvelous? You have an
idea, and then off it goes!

Side_10
That's them. Man your weapons.
Full steam ahead.

Side_22
We don't use steam. We row.

Side_10
Fine. Full row ahead.

Side_21
They're a-comin'! Dive!

Person_7
What are they doing?

Side_17
Collaborating.

Side_13
Vitruvius, follow my lead.

Side_21
Mateys! Be me hands and legs!
Start taking the ship apart!

Person_7
But we'll sink!

Side_13
That's the idea.

Side_21
Put the four-piece over there.
No! The skinny one. Come on!

Person_7
I don't get it-- What do I do?

Side_13
Build a hatch.

Person_7
Like for an attic?

Side_13
Like for a submarine.

Side_13
That's as far as you got?!

Person_7
Well...

Side_21
Heading?

Side_23
Arrrrrrrr.

Side_21
Get deeper. If we're too high
their sensorrrs will detect us.

Side_10
Nothing? But they were right here.

Side_22
Wait. There's something on the
scanner.

Side_21
Dive! Dive! Dive!

Side_22
Nothing. There's nothing.

Side_10
Let me see that... DAMMIT!

Side_22
Hey, watch it man, I built that.

Person_7
Hey Lucy, you gotta see--

Side_24
Where are my dang keys? Finn, have
you been playing in here?

Side_25
No.

Side_24
You sound like you are lying. Are
you lying?

Side_25
No.

Side_24
Side_26
Okay, this is my very special
area, where I play with something
anyone, because it is the most
awesome thing I have ever made.

Side_25
Uncle Ted, why don't you have a
girlfriend?

Side_24
Because you need money for
girlfriends. Although they refuse
to admit that. Although they
admit it implicitly when they
leave you for a banker.

Side_25
Why don't you have a job?

Side_24
Look, you can do anything you want
with this big bin of parts, okay?
Just promise me you aren't going
to play in my special areas
anymore.

Side_25
Okay.

Side_24
Is that a real okay or a fake one?

Side_25
Real.

Side_24
Okay. That's my man.

Side_17
Legotopia. The last free kingdom
in the universe.

Side_17
Thank you.

Person_7
Does the Black Falcon know about
this place?

Side_17
It's been hidden for ages by the
fog and its remote location. Plus
they have elaborate security
measures.

Side_27
Who goes there?

Person_7
Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex-
girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man,
a pirate head, and a loud dog.
We're here to save the world.

Side_27
Well, I've never heard of you, but
come on in!

Side_13
That's the security?

Side_28
Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my
Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!

Person_7
For Kreativity...

Side_28
Exaktly!

Person_7
Why did you build all this stuff?

Side_28
Well...Why not?

Side_28
If you can conceive it, we will
achieve it. Build anything
whenever you feel it.

Person_7
You know we really don't have time--

Side_28
Invent a game, like Roller
Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting
Tennis tickets...

Side_28
Just wide!

Side_21
This is me favorite sport.

Side_28
We only teach art and music in
school so kids feel unencumbered.
No spelling, reading, science or
math, we just make up all the
numbers!

Side_28
Make any idea thought or spoken.
Rules were meant to be broken!

Person_7
No, rules were meant to be
followed.

Side_29
We have everything and nothing and
something's all we've got. Why,
you ask? What you should ask is...
Why not?!!!!

Person_7
You guys are really weird.

Side_28
Cool, man, thank you.

Person_7
This is crazy. You can't have a
society without rules. I mean,
your castle doesn't look very
structurally sound at all!

Side_28
Who is this guy?

Side_13
Emmet. He doesn't get out much.

Side_17
Emmet, these people are not
MasterBuilders. They do not create
with purpose, they create just to
create. But they can also be very
inspiring, because the only way to
accomplish the impossible is to
break the rules of what is
possible.

Person_7
I wish that made sense to me.

Side_17
It will if you let it.
King Karl, I wish we came to you
with better news.

Side_28
As do I. The others arrived just
before you, which gave us a chance
to rehearse the song. Follow me.

Side_21
Ar! What a bounty! I be starrrving!

Side_28
Meet your team.

Side_30
Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email.
On my Batphone. Which I invented.
Gets emails. On a phone.

Person_7
Hello.

Side_13
And where do you come from?

Side_13
Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?

Side_28
No. But he wants to help.

Side_30
I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot
of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets?

Side_13
No thank you.

Side_31
I'm also a MasterBuilder.

Person_7
Cool!

Side_31
I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where
are you from? I'm from space.
There's not a lot of oxygen up
there. One time I was fixing my
ship in space and there was a
crack in my helmet. They say I
should've died or gotten Space
Madness but I didn't die. I'm
here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen
my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it
doesn't fly for some reason.

Person_7
Um, maybe if it didn't have two
fronts and no back, and it didn't
have five wings.

Side_31
I love wings. Wings are great,
right?

Side_21
He seems a little distracted.

Side_31
What? Where?

Side_13
Is this everyone?

Side_31
Oh, no. There's one more. My co-
pilot Moppy. He's really organized.

Side_31
Hi Moppy.
Hi everybody. Did you meet my
friend Benny? He's the best.
That's too nice of you, Mopper.
He can really help you with your
quest.
Well, I don't know.
He gets real lonely sometimes.
Moppy!
It's true. He was all alone in
space. He tried to look for his
space friends but couldn't find
them. No one is left but me. Him.

Person_7
What did you say you do again?

Side_31
Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First
Class.

Person_7
Ah.

Side_17
We are all that remain of the once
proud society of MasterBuilders.
Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's
not a MasterBuilder, he's just the
son of one. And Lucy, who is still
an intern.

Side_17
Along with a blind man, a pirate
head, a crazy spaceman, and
Batman...

Side_17
Together, we form a fellowship of
the MasterPiece. A shining beacon
of possibility, and the only thing
that can counteract the power of
the Kragle. If we can get this
into the hands of the Chosen One--

Side_10
Or didn't you know that as a
former student of MasterBuilder
academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd
on your mass email?

Side_28
I'm sorry, I had to let them in.

Side_13
King Karl! You betrayed us! You
betrayed everything you stand for!

Side_28
Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia
had run up like a bunch of debt.
Something about lots of spending
and no revenue. Empura promised
to fund the whole place.
Honestly, I'm super sorry.

Person_7
This guy is supposed to be
inspiring? More like conspiring...
with a bunch of mean jerks who
have my mom! You're just as bad as
them, you big mean jerk!

Side_28
Come on. Guys.

Side_28
Where are you taking them? Not to
the dungeon, right? You said--

Side_10
Do I look like a medieval
constable? No, they're going
someplace much worse. Take them
to... the conference room!

Side_10
Okay we're good to teleconference.

Side_32
OH THERE IT GOES! Can you
hear me? How about now? How about now? How

Side_10
Just, point the camera at you.

Side_33
I can't see anything.

Side_10
No, the other way. There. That's
close enough.

Side_33
Oh I see you! I see your hand.
Wave your hand. Ha ha! This is
amazing! Do you hear a weird echo
on your end? I can hear myself but
like two seconds later. Echo.
Echo. This is my voiceeeeeoooooo
aaaaayyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeee...

Side_10
Sir.

Side_33
Okay. Well well well, it looks
like I have you all right where I
want you. Good morning Vitruvius.

Side_17
Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the
Maker!

Side_13
No no he's just on teleconference.

Side_17
What?

Side_13
It's like a phone. A telegram.
He's not actually in the room.

Side_17
Like a crystal ball?

Side_13
Sure.

Side_33
Still being schooled by your
students, I see.

Side_33
I thought you might want to know
that my good friend Doris here is
safe and sound, so you don't have
anything to worry about.

Person_6
Emmet!

Person_7
Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you
down. Any more than I already
have!

Side_33
You've done enough, haven't you
sonny? After all, your mother is
now a distinguished member of my

Side_33
Every MasterBuilder in the world
is in this tank, having their
ideas extracted. Now, with the
ideas of the Chosen One, I can
finally build the best
Kraglethingy in the world, freeze
everything, and make the universe
exactly how I like it forever.

Person_7
Mom! No!

Side_33
There's nothing you can do, dude.
I already have the ideas. My
builders are putting the finishing
touches right now. What are you
going to show up here in the next
twenty four hours and stop me?
You just gave me the only hope you
had! You see this?

Person_3
These are all the lands I control!
They are perfect! And they are
going to be that way forever! Now
that you can't mess any of them
up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Side_13
So wait. What was the purpose of
this call then?

Side_33
To gloat. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha PEACE.

Person_7
You're a MasterBuilder, too?

Side_28
I dabble. You were right. I'd
rather be poor and free than
comfortable and stuck.

Side_28
Bring it on.

Side_28
Prepare for battle!

Side_28
On my mark.

Side_10
Charge.

Side_28
Charge!

Side_28
Retreat!

Side_28
You have to go.

Person_7
We can't leave you here.

Side_28
It's my place to be here. Go!

Side_31
Everyone get in my spaceship!

Person_7
Over there!

Side_13
We have to go now!

Person_7
I built that chair! Check it out.
That's my chair. Pretty good.

Side_13
That's far more impressive than
this entire Rocket-Copter.

Person_7
Well, it was my idea to get in the
catapult.

Side_13
A credit hog. Great.

Side_30
Where'd this thing come from?

Person_7
No idea.

Side_21
Bogey on our six!

Side_31
Hey look at that over there--

Side_13
Benny! Focus!

Side_21
There!

Person_7
My chair!!!!

Side_30
I say we camp here for the night
in this creepy Old West Ghost
Town.

Side_13
What's up?

Person_7
Can't sleep. Kind of still upset
about everything, you know?

Side_13
Upset about what?

Person_7
Well, I got in a fight with my mom
that caused her to get kidnapped
and the whole world is about to
get frozen, if you must know,
unless you were asking that
sarcastically, which I now realize
you were.

Side_13
Sorry.

Side_13
We'll find her.

Person_7
I hope so.

Side_13
I know it. I know you.

Person_7
I thought you said I didn't have a
creative bone in my body.

Side_13
You don't.

Person_7
That's nice, thank you.

Side_13
I'm just trying to help.

Person_7
You know what you are, Lucy?

Side_13
What?

Person_7
A real pain in the elbow.

Person_7
What?

Side_13
You may not have a creative bone
in your body, but you have a lot
of really really earnest bones.
You always did.

Person_7
Thank you?

Side_13
I mean, that day when we were
kids, and you drew the face in art
class, you inspired me. I thought
maybe there was more out there in
the world, and maybe you felt the
same. That's why I asked you out.
But then you ended up like
everyone else and broke my heart,
you know? That I was going one way
and you didn't go with me.

Person_7
Think of how I felt. My mom
trained me to follow the herd. To
lay low. All I ever wanted was to
fit in, to have friends. And the
funny thing is, maybe I was trying
too hard, but, my whole life, I
never did have any real friends.

Side_13
We're being so dramatic. It was
eighth grade!

Person_7
That's the most dramatic time in
anyone's life, right? It's what
made The Black Falcon such a world
class dingaling.

Side_13
It made a lot of us dingalings.

Person_7
Yeah.

Side_13
You know, whenever I doubt myself,
I look into this prism I found
long ago...

Person_7
It's... beautiful.

Side_13
I know. It's a relic of the Maker.
When I'm feeling low, I look at
it, and it always makes me feel
like there still is beauty in the
world, and we all have a purpose.
You know what I mean?

Person_7
Yeah. I do.

Side_13
Well, good night.

Person_7
Yeah. Okay.

Side_34
Finn? What did you do to the
spaceship? It's in pieces! I
told you not to play with this and
you broke it! It took me years to
build all this!

Side_34
And what's it doing in the Old
West Town? And is that Batman? It
doesn't belong here!

Side_35
I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just
wanted to play.

Side_34
Well, life isn't all play.
Sometimes it's serious and it gets
screwed up and you don't feel like
playing. You just wish for once
everything was in the right place.

Side_17
I don't suppose this is the
restroom?

Person_7
No. Definitely not.
Hey, Can I ask you something? I
keep having these strange dreams
about a squishy bumpy giant--

Side_17
Visions of the Maker. Quite
unusual.

Person_7
What does it mean? Do I have a
fate?

Side_17
We all have a fate. But
MasterBuilding is about channeling
the power of the Maker, and taking
that fate into our own hands. I
guess it could mean what you
choose to make it mean.

Person_7
Why do you always talk in weird
riddles? I just want answers.

Side_17
Then why don't you try building
something for yourself?

Person_7
I'm sorry, that's lame.

Side_17
Not bad. You're learning now.

Person_7
No I'm not. I'm just copying what
you did.

Side_17
A dilettante borrows. A true
artist steals.

Person_7
That makes no sense!

Side_17
And all this does?

Side_13
How the heck are we going to do
this?

Person_7
It's okay. I have a plan.

Side_13
Really?

Person_7
This R2 unit had the plans for
Empura Tower stored in its memory
bank.

Side_13
That's convenient.

Person_7
Looking over it last night, I
noticed the tower follows the same
construction principles as the
condos I was building back in
Legopolis.

Person_7
Wait.

Side_13
What about this?

Side_13
Darn.

Side_17
How about this?

Side_17
What, is it because I'm blind?

Side_30
Check this out:

Side_13
Stop it! Everyone!

Side_17
Creativity in groups is hard.

Side_13
We don't have time for that.

Person_7
Or we can just wing it.

Side_36
Well, I don't know, I've lived
alone a long time, and sharing
space with you is a new thing for
me...no it's not like that...
Hey, we didn't order any--

Side_13
I love you please move in with me.

Person_7
The Black Falcon's office!

Side_30
My office is bigger.

Side_13
Emmet.

Side_21
Arr, his appointment book be
saying he be scheduled for a
massage at four.

Side_30
He'll get a flipping massage
alright.

Side_37
Language! There are kids here.

Side_30
Who are these nerds?

Side_38
We, uh, can't move.

Side_13
They won't budge.

Side_39
The bad guy is going to freeze
everyone.

Side_40
Kids? Are you okay?

Side_37
They're alright, baby.

Side_38
I miss you, mom.

Person_7
Me too.
This is really sad. How can you
keep living like this?

Side_37
Well, yeah, we can't be together.
We can't touch or see each other.
But in here-- and if I could, I'd
be pointing to my head-- I'm not
stuck. In my brain we're sharing
a delicious meal together.

Side_40
Thank you sweetie.

Side_39
Pass the mustard.

Side_13
That's pretty elaborate.

Side_37
They can freeze you. They can tell
you what to do. But they can't
stop our secret weapon. Ideas.
Now go give `em hell.

Person_7
Wait. Batman, give me your
Batperiscope.

Person_7
Now at least you can see each
other.

Side_41
You there. Listen to me.

Side_42
You have grown a beard.

Side_41
I be trying it out. What do ye
think?

Side_42
It's very nice.

Side_41
Thank you. Arr.

Side_42
Is there something in your throat,
sir?

Side_41
Yes. It be a new throat something
I'm trying out. Do ye like it?

Side_42
Very much.

Side_41
Say, I beed wondering if you could
do me a favor.

Side_42
At your service, commander.

Side_41
Take off your ninja clothes.

Side_42
Sir?

Side_41
I be the boss, ain't I be?

Side_42
Yes, sir.

Side_41
Now pull each other's heads off
and kick them way down the hallway
where you can't see them anymore.

Side_42
Yes, sir-- ow!

Side_41
Very good. Now count to one
thousand.

Side_41
This be awesome.

Side_43
Black Falcon? You're supposed to
be at your massage.

Side_41
I uh...

Person_7
Mom...

Person_6
What? Emmet?

Person_7
It's me, Mom. I've here to save
you, so you can save the world.

Side_17
Rodrigo Falcone. My old student.
It's time you went back to SCHOOL!

Person_3
The old dog still has a few
tricks. But I guess your friends
didn't tell you that I was flanked
by like a hundred soldiers. Now!

Person_3
Get the rest of them!

Side_13
Why won't anything in this hallway
break off?!

Side_30
It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!

Side_21
Lucy.

Side_13
Yes?

Side_21
I want you to know, I love you.

Side_13
Me too...

Side_21
And even if the world be ending,
and we all get frozen, I'd feel
better about the whole situation
if I could get frozen with you as
my bride.

Side_13
Are you really doing this?

Side_21
Lucy. Will you take me hand in
marriage? Metaphorically.

Side_13
Um...

Side_21
Lucy!

Person_7
Mom! Hurry!

Person_7
No!

Person_6
No!

Side_30
We can't win this. We've got to
hide and make a new plan.

Side_21
Arrr!

Side_33
Aw how cute. Mother and son...
together at last. And what's this?

Side_33
I've been looking for a
paperweight.
Did you really think you were
going to come up here and save the
day? You're a follower, my
friend. You don't have the stuff.
And you. You must be real proud
of this one, huh? He's a credit
to the family. Just like his
talentless father.

Person_7
Mom, I'm so sorry.

Person_6
I know sweetie.

Person_7
Just- tell me everything's going
to be okay.

Person_6
I wish I could, son.

Person_7
Mom... Why didn't you -- why
didn't you teach me what you knew?

Person_6
I wanted you to be safe. I thought
you would be happier. When I saw
you with that funny drawing, it
was so marvelous. And then I
thought of what your life would
be, how everyone would treat you.
I just couldn't let that happen.

Person_7
I know you're the Chosen One, but--
I just wish you had let me choose
for myself.

Person_6
I...I don't know what to say.

Side_33
You guys want to see it? Let me
take you up to the construction
site! Things are about to get a
little sticky down here.

Person_7
They got promoted...

Side_33
Behold: The SuperKragleThingy
Part II.

Side_33
It's my best work.

Person_7
But you didn't do anything.

Side_33
Are you kidding? You think the
MasterBuilders just up and forced
themselves to think of this? Did
those guys force themselves to
build it? No. I did. Ergo, it's
mine.
Look down there.

Side_33
Magnificent, isn't it? And now it
will be just the way I want.

Side_33
Release the Kragle!

Side_30
That does not look good.

Side_21
When do we get to the part about
coming up with a plan?

Side_31
I've got a plan.

Side_21
Uh-oh.

Side_21
What about Lucy and the others?

Side_31
We'll come back for them. After we
stop that Kragle.

Side_31
Can we go in the blue one?

Side_10
There they are!

Side_21
What does it matter?

Side_31
I fly better in blue.

Side_10
No! Re-open the door! Everyone in
ships! Go!

Side_44
Dude, you don't have to yell.

Side_33
Left. Right. Straight. Now
stand up super tall and scary!

Side_45
Every time!--

Person_3
Bahahahahahahaha!!

Person_6
It's too horrible to bear.

Side_17
What is? Describe it to me. I
feel really really left out!

Person_7
The world is ending.

Side_30
Go down to the city! What are you
doing?

Side_31
Calling for help from my space
friends!

Side_21
What, a bunch of mops? There be no
space friends! Just go!

Side_31
Alright, you don't have to be mean
about it.

Side_12
< SIGH > Of course.

Side_46
What the heck is happening?

Side_12
I think a big dinobot is freezing
everything with mucusy sneezes.

Side_46
So we're doomed? What do we do?

Side_12
I don't know. Complain?

Side_12
I mean, it's not like we can do
anything.

Side_46
How annoying.

Side_12
Wait a minute...

Side_46
What are you doing?

Side_12
I don't know exactly. I'm just
going with it.

Side_46
Larry. My goodness.

Side_33
What?! This is terrible! I can't
see!
No offense.
Who the heck did that?

Side_13
That guy?!

Side_33
Hey! Guys! Swipe! Swipe! No!
You're doing it wrong! Ugh...
This is a disaster!

Person_3
Do I smell something burning? It
smells like a tire fire in here.

Person_6
I... don't know what to do. So
tired...

Side_13
She's too weak. You have to do it.

Person_7
Do what? What can I do?

Side_13
I believe in you, Emmet. I was
mad because you disappointed me
for a while, but since it wasn't
your fault, I'm willing to give
you a mulligan on it.

Person_7
A what?

Side_13
A mulligan. It's from golf.

Person_7
You play golf?

Side_13
The point is, you've spent your
whole life wanting to fit in and
have friends, by pretending to be
something you're not. But now that
you've let the real you shine
through, you've made some friends
who like you for who you are. And
even if they're just a crazy
spaceman and a pirate head and a
blind man and an intern--

Person_7
You like me?

Side_13
I do.

Person_7
Neckbeard likes me?

Side_13
...Sure.

Person_7
But... I'm not the Chosen One.

Side_13
You wanted to make your own
choices, right? So choose
yourself.

Person_7
Nuh uh.

Side_33
Wait, what's going on?! What the
hell are you smiling about?!

Person_7
This.

Person_6
What is it, Emmet?

Person_7
I don't know. It just came to me.

Side_17
You have channeled the Maker and
chosen your fate. You have chosen
to be the Chosen One.

Side_33
You are going to defeat me by
making some kind of art? Ha ha
ha! Oh let me put on my Pink
Floyd album so I can totally zone
out! Ha ha ha this is so lame!

Person_3
Whoa. That was weird.

Side_12
What the heck is that?!

Side_31
Wow, that thing is really big.

Side_21
Uh, Benny...

Side_33
Get that spaceship out of there! I
don't want to freeze space stuff
in the city--OOF!

Side_13
What do we do?

Person_6
Go after him.

Side_33
If you want to get something done,
you have to do it yourself!!!

Side_12
Quick, everyone! Run behind it!
Get away from the mist!

Side_47
It's a b--

Person_7
So...not square.

Person_7
The Maker. It's all real...

Person_7 TED
It just tried to kill me! It just tried to kill me!

Side_34
What the heck are you?!

Person_7
What the heck are you?!

Side_34
I'm a person.

Person_7
I'm a person. You on the other
hand are a giant squishy beast.

Side_34
You're a talking toy. This is
considerably less cute than I have
been led to believe.

Person_7
So ugly...

Person_7
What are these?!

Side_34
Calm down! Where did you come
from?

Person_7
Did you build that?

Side_34
Yeah, but it's seriously messed
up.

Person_7
Are you the Maker?

Side_34
The what?

Side_35
What?

Side_34
Are you seeing this?

Side_35
Yeah.

Person_7
Two Makers?

Side_34
How did this-- what is-- my sets,

Side_35
The guys. They needed my help.

Side_34
Against what?

Side_35
Against the Kragle.

Side_34
The what?

Person_7
The Kragle. The thing that is
freezing everything together.

Side_34
Oh. Krazy Glue?

Person_7
Good Lord.

Side_34
What? I'm using this to glue my
set together. So it won't get
messed up by the kid.

Person_7
But then-- it can never change.

Side_34
Exactly. It's the only thing in
my life that's perfect.

Side_34
I can't find a job that doesn't
make me hate myself. My
girlfriend dumped me for a rich
trustafarian... dingaling, is what
he is, and I'm watching my
sister's kid while she has a fun
time partying in the Hamptons with
her annoying brood of hot
girlfriends who won't have a thing
to do with me, and the only thing
I have in my life that makes any
sense, that I have any control
over is that perfect world right
there.

Person_7
But... nothing is perfect unless
it can change. You can make
something, you know, and it can be
great, for a while, but then...
then someone maybe adds to it,
makes something new out of it. And
that keeps happening until it
becomes something that a single
person could never envision. Truth
is, creating alone is never as
good as creating with others.

Side_34
See. No. That's not true-
because with others, they don't
see things the same way, so--

Person_7
I know. You want to control
everything. I get it. But if you
succeed, in the end, all you'll
ever have is what you've got.

Side_34
What else could I have?

Person_7
Who knows? That's the best part.

Side_34
Use this.

Person_7
What is it?

Side_34
What is it? It's the ca--

Side_35
Cone of Power. It's called the
Cone of Power.

Side_34
Okay. The Cone of Power.

Side_35
Put it on the Kragle to stop it.

Side_34
Yeah. Try that.

Person_7
Thank you. It was nice to meet
you both, disgusting squishy giant
Maker creature and smaller,
messier giant Maker creature.

Side_35
Nice to meet you.

Person_7
I should go save the world now.

Side_34
Let's play.

Side_33
Detach and mobilize! Stop that
loser!

Side_31
Hello!

Person_7
Thanks for dropping in.

Side_30
I hope we're not imposing.

Side_30
There's too many of them!

Side_21
They're coming at us from all
sides!

Side_31
Guy! Look up! My space friends!
They got my message!

Side_49
Anything for you, Benny!

Side_21
Lucy!

Side_13
Neckbeard! We need to talk...

Side_12
I could build such a better ship
than that.

Side_46
Why don't we?

Side_33
Didn't your mom tell you? She
designed this thing with a missile
launcher!

Person_6
Emmet!

Side_13
Doris, are you okay back there?

Side_13
Doris?! Why did she do that?

Side_17
The connection between a mother
and son is a powerful thing.

Side_13
But it's certain death.

Side_17
On the contrary. It's connections
like those that give the best
chance to survive...

Person_6
Get your hands off my flipping
son.

Person_7
Mom... Wow. Just... wow.

Person_6
I'm the Chosen One, remember?

Person_7
I guess that makes two of us.

Person_6
this time I was trying to keep you
from getting hurt, so I told you
so glad that I get to see the
beautiful waves you finally get to

Person_7
Side_33
Aw. That's sweet. I want to take
a picture so I can remember you
like this FOREVER!

Person_7
Lucy? How did you do that?

Side_13
I used a few connections.

Person_6
Emmet, now's your chance!

Side_33
Nuh-uh-uh. One step closer, and
bye-bye mommy. Now go away, you
freak, you weirdo, you loser. You
don't belong here. You don't
belong anywhere.

Person_7
You're right. I don't belong
here...

Person_7
I belong here!

Side_33
No!

Person_7
Rest in pieces.

Side_47
--oy!

Side_50
Thank God!

Side_13
What the heck just happened?

Person_7
Something totally foofy.

Person_1
--is it just me, or is it getting
crazier out there?

Person_2
It's certainly tense. People are
upset, they're struggling. Looking
for work. The garbage strike seems
like it's been going on forever.
These are tough times.
How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
enjoying it?

Person_1
Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
day, so   I really like that. I don't
think I   could ever work in an
office.   Behind a desk.

Person_1
No offense.

Person_2
Have you been keeping up with your
journal?

Person_1
Everyday.

Person_2
Great. Did you bring it with you?

Person_1
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?

Person_2
(impatient; she doesn't
have time for this)
Arthur, last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you. For
these appointments. Do you have it?

Person_1
Yes ma'am.

Person_2
Can I see it?

Person_1
I've been using it as a journal,
but also a joke diary. Funny
thoughts or, or observations-- Did
I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
stand-up comedy?

Person_2
No. You didn't.

Person_1
I think I did.

Person_2
Oh yeah. Because of what your
mother said,-- about your purpose.
"To bring laughter and joy to the
world," right?

Person_1
Right.

Person_1
I didn't realize you wanted to read
it.

Person_2
"I just hope my death makes more
sense than my life."

Person_1
Yeah. I mean, that's just--

Person_2
Does my reading it upset you?

Person_1
No. I just,-- some of it's
personal. You know?

Person_2
I understand. I just want to make
sure you're keeping up with it.

Person_2
What about your mom? How's she
feeling?

Person_1
She has good days. But mostly bad.
It's been a big help having me
there. She really needs me.

Person_2
Seems like she's been sick a lot
since you got home.

Person_1
Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
was in the hospital, after my last
episode-- she was having trouble
getting over there to visit.

Person_2
All right. So, I'll see you again,
two weeks from today?

Person_2
Is there something else I can help
you with, Arthur? My next
appointment is waiting.

Person_1
Yeah, I was wondering if you could
ask the doctor to increase the
dosage on my medications? Nothing
seems to make a difference.

Person_2
Do you know which ones you'd like
increased?

Person_2
Have you been sleeping?

Person_1
Some.

Person_2
Arthur, you're on seven different
medications. Surely they must be
doing something.

Person_1
I just don't wanna feel so bad
anymore.

Person_3
(turns back to Joker;
already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my
kid?

Person_1
I wasn't bothering her, I was--

Person_3
Just stop.

Person_3
You think that's funny?

Person_4
Wait!!

Person_4
Thank you.
Of course it's you,-- everyone else
in this building is just so fucking
rude.

Person_4
How's your mom doing?

Person_1
It's day to day. I'm doing
everything I can to get her back on
her feet.
Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
her some dinner.

Person_4
She's lucky she has you--

Person_4
Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
many times have I told you that?
This building is so awful, isn't
it?

Person_4
Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
hello.

Person_1
Hey Sophie--

Person_1
I'll tell my mom you said hello.

Person_5
(shattering the moment,
calls out)
Happy?! Did you check the mail
before you came up?

Person_1
Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.

Person_5
You sure you looked? Sometimes I
don't know where your head is.

Person_1
Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
here. I'm gonna make you some
dinner, okay?

Person_5
He must not be getting my letters.

Person_1
He's a busy man.

Person_5
Too busy for me? I worked for that
family for 12 years. He always had
a smile for me. Least he could do
is write back.

Person_1
Ma, eat. You need to eat.

Person_5
You need to eat. Look how skinny
you are.

Person_5
All day long it's more bad news.
That's all there is.

Person_1
Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
television.

Person_5
He's the only hope for Gotham.
He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
says so.

Person_1
Everybody who? Who do you talk to?

Person_5
Well everybody on the news.

Person_1
Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
mayor? He can do more good as a
businessman.

Person_5
Because he cares about this city.
And everyone in it-- that's why I
can't believe he hasn't written me
back.

Person_1
He will. Now eat some dinner.

Person_1
How you feeling today?

Person_5
I don't know. It always hits me
worse at night, you notice that?

Person_1
Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
werewolf?

Person_5
It's not funny.

Person_5
Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
A better one. I want you to hand
deliver it to him.

Person_1
What? Why?

Person_5
Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
them away. We should have tipped
him at Christmas time.

Person_1
Who tips their mailman?

Person_5
Some people do. Rich people do.

Person_1
Okay. I can try his office.
Tomorrow.

Person_5
Thank you.
Come sit. It's almost on.

Person_1
Hello. I have a personal letter for
Mr. Thomas Wayne.

Person_6
Okay. You can leave it with me.

Person_1
It's kind of important. I need to
make sure he gets it himself.

Person_6
Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
right in.

Person_6
I'm kidding. Leave it here.

Person_1
Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
work for the Wayne family-- for 12
years. She was their housekeeper.

Person_6
That's great. But you can leave it
with me or you can leave with the
letter. Those are your options. Now
please step aside.

Person_1
Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
at least call back to him? Tell him
that I'm here.

Person_6
Thomas Wayne is away on business.

Person_1
Okay. Well, can I have your name?
So I know who I left it with.

Person_1
Wait. He's right there.
(goes up to the glass,
shouts)
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.

Person_6
Sir. Please stop. Sir!!

Person_7
You okay?

Person_7
I heard about the beat down you
took. Fucking savages.

Person_1
It was just a bunch of kids. I
should have left it alone.

Person_7
It's crazy out there. And it's only
getting worse.

Person_1
My mother says that the people
nowadays lack empathy.

Person_7
What's empathy?

Person_1
It means like "feeling for other
people."

Person_7
Like sympathy?

Person_1
Kind of. But different.

Person_7
Take it. I got a few. You gotta
protect yourself out there, buddy.
Too many wackos.

Person_7
It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
done if you ever need to use it.
Usually pulling it out is enough.

Person_1
I, I don't have the money for this,
Randall.

Person_7
Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
other time. You're my boy.

Person_7
But you didn't get it from me,
okay?

Person_8
Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in
his office.

Person_1
What for?

Person_8
No clue.

Person_1
Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
see me?

Person_9
How's the comedy career? Are you a
famous stand-up yet?

Person_1
Not quite. Haven't even performed
yet. Just been working my material.
This business is all about fine-
tuning.

Person_9
Right.

Person_9
Don't sit. This will be quick.

Person_9
Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
the guys here, they think you're a
freak. But I like you. I don't even
know why I like you. I mean, you
don't say much.
It's probably that stupid laugh. It
gets me every time. Kills me.

Person_9
But I got another complaint. And
it's starting to piss me off.

Person_9
Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
you disappeared. Never even
returned his sign.

Person_1
No. I got jumped. I told you about
that.

Person_9
For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
sense, just give him his sign back.
He's going out of business for
god's--

Person_9
Hey!

Person_9
What the fuck, Arthur?!

Person_1
I don't have his sign.

Person_5
--so what did he say when you gave
him the letter?

Person_1
They wouldn't let me see him.
But they promised me it would get
to him.

Person_5
It's good they promised. He only
works with the best. We should hear
something soon.

Person_1
Look up.

Person_1
Why are these letters so important
to you, Ma? What do you think he's
gonna do?

Person_5
He's gonna help us.

Person_1
Help us how?

Person_5
Get us out of here, take me away
from this place and these-- these
awful people.

Person_1
You worked for him over 30 years
ago. What makes you think he would
help you?

Person_5
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
If he knew how I was living, if he
saw this place, it would make him
sick. I can't explain it to you any
better than that.

Person_1
I don't want you worrying about
money. Everyone's been telling me
they think my stand-up is ready for
the big clubs. It's just a matter
of time before I get a break.

Person_5
Happy, what makes you think you
could do that?

Person_1
What do you mean?

Person_5
I mean, don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

Person_5
HAPPY!? What was that?

Person_1
What?!

Person_5
It's so loud.

Person_1
I know. The Americans are really
giving it to the Japs.

Person_1
I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.

Person_1
Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
was loaded? He's my friend. With my
luck, I could have killed someone.
I could have killed myself.

Person_1
I should have killed myself.

Person_1
I should kill myself.

Person_1
Hello. I'd like to open an account.

Person_4
Hey, what are you doing up here?

Person_1
Oh, hi. That's weird.
(pausing to see if he's
gonna laugh; he's good)
I didn't know you worked at a bank.

Person_4
Pretty glamorous, right?

Person_1
Very glamorous. Look at this place.

Person_1
I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
comedy.

Person_4
Really? I had no idea.

Person_1
Yeah. You know, I'm always making
funny observations. Always on the
look out for my next bit-- so it
makes sense.

Person_4
Right. Anyway, is there something I
could help you with?

Person_1
I said hi to my mom.

Person_4
Excuse me?

Person_1
Last week. You said to say hi to my
mom. I did. Made her day.

Side_1
Everything okay here?

Person_4
Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.

Person_4
(shakes her head; to her
manager)
No. He's not. He's interested in
opening an account.

Side_1
Great. You just need to fill out a
form. They are back there-- against
the wall.

Person_1
(covering; trying to act
cool)
Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
as well, Miss.

Person_1
(shouts out, to no one in
particular)

Person_1
If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet.

Person_1
If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet.
If you're happy and you know it and
you really want to show it, if
you're happy and you know it stomp
your feet.

Person_1
Hoyt, let me explain.

Person_1
It was, it was a prop gun. It's
part of my act now.

Person_1
Randall told you that?

Person_1
Hoyt--

Person_1
Say what?

Person_1
--I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

Person_1
I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

Person_1 SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN,
face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along
with his wig.

Side_3
No thank you.

Person_1
(shakes his head, stifling
the laughter)
Please. Don't.

Person_1
Nothing. I have a condition--

Person_1
No. It's just my stuff. I don't
have anything.

Person_1
Hi. Do you like to laugh?

Person_1
Remember how I told you that I'm a
stand-up comedian?
Hi. How are you?

Person_1
Hi. Do you like to laugh?

Person_4
What?

Person_1
(continuing without taking
a breath)
Remember the other day when I told
you about my stand-up comedy. Well,
I'm doing a set next Thursday and
I'm inviting a bunch of my friends
and I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to come and check it out.

Person_1
Were you crying? Why are you
crying?

Person_4
I had a bad day.

Person_1
I'm sorry. I, I didn't--

Person_4
It's okay. How would you know.

Person_1
What happened?

Person_4
I got fired. From the bank.

Person_1
What for?

Person_4
Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't
fucking matter. I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

Person_1
Okay. Well, all the info is right
there on the flyer.

Person_1
You know they say laughter is the
best medicine.

Person_4
Is that what they say?

Person_2
We spoke about this last time,
Arthur. You're supposed to bring
your journal with you.

Person_1
Well I didn't think you were going
to read it.

Person_2
You said it didn't bother you.

Person_1
I lied. Everything bothers me.

Person_2
What about it bothered you?

Person_1
It's personal. It's my private
thoughts. Plus it contains original
comedy material that I don't feel
comfortable handing over to you.

Person_2
Arthur, I have some bad news for
you.

Person_2
They've cut our funding. We're
closing down our offices next week.

Person_1
So where will we be meeting?

Person_2
We won't be. The city's cut funding
across the board. Social services
is part of that.

Person_1
Okay.

Person_2
They don't give a shit about people
like you, Arthur. You don't have a
voice and they don't really care
what happens to you or to us for
that matter.

Person_1
How am I gonna get my medication?

Person_5
Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
is on TV.

Person_5
Quick! Come.

Person_5
They're interviewing him about
those horrible murders on the
subway last week.

Person_1
Why are they talking to him?

Person_5
You hear that! I told you. We're
family.

Side_4
This next comic describes himself
as a lifelong Gotham resident who
from a young age was always told
that "his purpose in life was to
bring joy and laughter into this
cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.

Side_4
Please help me welcome Arthur
Fleck!

Person_1
(trying to stop himself
from laughing)
-- good evening, hello.
(deep breath; trying to
stop laughing)
Good to be here.
I, I hated school as a kid. But my
mother would always say,--
(bad imitation of his mom,
still laughing)
"You should enjoy it. One day
you'll have to work for a living."
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
comedian!"

Person_1
So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
see much from up there.

Person_4
Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
anything?

Person_1
All I heard was my heart pounding.

Person_4
It was good. I really needed to get
out of my apartment so, thanks.
What happened to the rest of your
friends?

Person_1
What friends?

Person_4
Didn't you say some of your friends
were coming?

Person_1
Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
As a performer sometimes you want
to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
People who don't already love me,
or, or have a notion of who I am,
you know?

Person_4
Yeah. I get that.

Person_4
You believe that shit?

Person_1
Yeah,-- I don't know how something
like that happens.

Person_4
Please. I'll bet you five bucks
those rich assholes deserved it.

Person_1
You think?

Person_4
Look at their faces. Those smug
smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
them.

Person_4
The guy who did it is a hero. Three
less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
hoo! Only a million more to go.

Person_1
Hey. You want to get some coffee?

Person_4
--I'm telling you, it's across the
board. Wall Street, the banks,
politicians. They've been making a
killing for years. Fuck them.

Person_1
I don't know.

Person_4
What don't you know?

Person_1
Not all of them are awful. Take
someone like Thomas Wayne for
example. He's a hero.

Person_4
Oh c'mon, he's the worst!

Person_1
Sophie, he's the only one who can
save this city.

Person_4
You can't be serious!? He's a
complete narcissist. Brags about
his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
us can barely make rent. Or feed
our kids.

Person_1
What happened?

Person_4
With what?

Person_1
With your job. At the bank?

Person_4
Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--

Person_1
We don't have to talk about it.

Person_4
Have you ever been fired before?

Person_1
Every time.

Person_4
And have you ever wanted to torch
the place?

Person_1
Every time.

Person_4
Right. And this was like the first
good job I had in like, years. Not
waitressing or anything like that.
It was 9-5. I had benefits. You
know what that means when you have
a kid?

Person_4
But from the very first day, the
manager guy starts smiling at me,
whispering in my ear, touching me,
trying to get me to sleep with him--

Person_1
Did you do it? Did you go to bed
with him?

Person_4
Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.
So finally I complained to his
boss, and they fired me... And now,
now I don't know what to do with
myself.

Person_1
Right. Wait, what do you mean?

Person_4
I finally felt good. Like I had a
future. A purpose. And now I don't
even know how I'm gonna pay my
rent.

Person_1
I'm sorry. I have this thing--

Person_4
I know.

Person_4
How did you get it?

Person_1
I don't know. I read you can get it
from a brain injury or, or a lesion
in there. My mom said I was born
this way. Born laughing.

Person_4
Is that why she calls you Happy?

Person_1
Kind of. That actually started when
I was a kid. The other kids made
fun of me, called me Happy-- but
not in a good way. I got so sick of
it, one day when I was about ten,

Person_4
What?

Person_1
I took a razor and cut this smile
onto my face.
(she's taken aback as he
points to the scars)
Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
how's this for happy?"

Person_4
You okay?

Person_1
I've been thinking about this night
my whole life.

Person_1
"That's life."

Person_5
--what, what time is it?

Person_5
What happened? Did you hurt
yourself again?

Person_1
What is this? How come you never
told me?

Person_5
Is, is that my letter? Is that my
letter, Happy?

Person_1
How could you not tell me, Ma?

Person_5
You told me you dropped it off.
You have no right opening my mail.
Who do you think you are?

Person_1
(raising his voice;
excited)

Person_1
Apparently I'm Thomas Wayne's son!
How could you keep that from me?

Person_5
Stop yelling at me, you're gonna
kill me, give me a heart attack!

Person_1
I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited.
How can any of this be real!? How
can Thomas Wayne be my father?

Person_5
(shouts back from behind
the door)
I'm not talking to you until you
calm down.

Person_1
(lowers his voice; trying
to sound calm)
Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will
you please talk to me?

Person_1
Please.

Person_5
He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
We had a connection. I was so
beautiful then. We were in love.

Person_5
His wife could see it. She was
jealous from the moment I started
working there. She fired me before
I even knew I was pregnant with
you.

Person_5
And, I never told him or anybody
because, well, you can imagine what
people would say about Thomas and
me, and, and what they would say
about you.

Person_1
(eyes still closed, head
leaning against the door)
What would they say, Ma?

Person_5
That I was a whore, and Thomas
Wayne was a fornicator, and that
you're a little, unwanted bastard.

Person_8
Hey Art, I heard what happened--
I'm sorry man.

Person_7
Yeah, Hoyt did you wrong, buddy.
Doesn't seem fair.

Person_1
It was a prop gun. And I didn't
pull it out, it fell out.

Side_5
So is that part of your new act? If
your singing doesn't do the trick,
you just gonna shoot yourself?

Person_1
Why don't you ask Randall about it?
It was his idea.

Person_8
Since when do you use a prop gun?

Person_7
What? I don't. Stop talking outta
your ass, Art!

Person_7
I think all his stupid laughing
musta scrambled his brain or
something.

Person_7
Art! Hold up,--

Person_7
What the fuck was that about?

Person_1
What?

Person_7
Why would you say that? That, that
it was my idea.

Person_7
You don't get it, do you, buddy,
that shit that went down on the
subway, that's no joke. They got
clown sketches on the front of
every fucking paper. It's just a
matter of time before the cops come
around.

Person_1
I don't know anything about it.

Person_7
(leans in close; lowers
his voice)
Art, you know you're my boy. I'm
not gonna say shit. I just hope you
got rid of that gun. That can't
come back on me, okay?

Person_1
Randall, I didn't shoot anybody.
That wasn't me. And I don't have
time for this, I got somebody real
important I gotta go see.

Person_7
You know they're sellin' masks.

Person_1
What?

Person_7
They're selling masks of your clown
face,-- based off the description I
guess. It's like a thing now.

Person_1
What are you talking about?

Person_7
There's a lot of people in this
city who are happy you did what you
did. If you did it.

Person_1
Randall. Your nose.

Person_7
What?

Side_6
DAY'S TABLOID, a more detailed drawing.

Side_7
PHOTOGRAPH OF THOMAS WAYNE RIPPED OUT FROM A MAGAZINE, taped
to a page. He glances at his distorted reflection in the
window, takes his hand and parts his hair to the side, more
like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.

Person_1 IN THE BACK OF A TAXI STARING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE,
at the trees and green grass and blue sky and open spaces
whizzing by. The sun is getting low, bathing everything in a
golden light.

Side_9
(shouting; slight English
accent)
Bruce! What are you doing? Get away
from that man.

Side_9
What are you doing? Who are you?

Person_1
My name's Arthur. I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne--

Side_9
You shouldn't be talking to his
son. Why did you give him those
flowers?

Person_1
I, I was just trying to make him
laugh.

Side_9
Well it's not funny. Do I need to
call the police?

Person_1
No, please. My mother's name is
Penny Fleck. She used to work here,
years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne
that I need to see him?

Side_9
(color drains from his
face; beat)
You're her son?

Person_1
Did you know her?

Person_1
You don't need to cover for them.
I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset
when she found out.

Side_9
There was nothing to find out
about. Your mother was, was
delusional. She was a sick woman.

Person_1
No. No, just let me speak to Mr.
Wayne.

Side_9
Please just go, before you make a
fool of yourself.

Person_1
Thomas Wayne is my father--

Side_10
Mr. Fleck, sorry to bother you, I'm
Detective Garrity, this is my
partner Detective Burke.

Side_10
We had a few questions for you, but
you weren't home. So we spoke to
your mother.

Person_1
You did this to her?

Side_10
What? No. We just asked her some
questions and she started getting
hysterical-- hyperventilating,
trouble speaking-- then she
collapsed. Hit her head pretty
hard.

Person_1
They told me she had a stroke.

Side_10
Sorry to hear that.

Side_11
I'm lost. Is something funny?

Person_1
(laughter choking up in
his throat)
No I,-- I have a, a--

Side_11
Okay. But we have some questions
for you.

Side_10
About those subway killings from a
few weeks ago.

Person_1
I don't know anything about that.

Side_10
We have an eyewitness who described
a white male, about 6 feet tall, in
clown make up. Or a clown mask.
Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr.
Vaughn, and he said you were on a
job the day of the shooting.

Side_10
He also said you got fired that
day,-- For bringing a gun into the
children's hospital.

Side_10
You weren't fired?

Person_1
Not for having a gun. That was prop
gun. Part of my act.

Side_11
So why were you fired?

Person_1
They said I wasn't funny.

Person_1
Now, if you don't mind, I have to
go back and look after my mother.

Side_11
Hey lemme ask you a question? This
condition of yours,-- Is this real
or is this like some sorta clown
thing?

Person_1
Clown thing?

Side_11
I mean, is it part of your act?

Person_1
What do you think?

Person_1
Excuse me, I was wondering how I
could check my mother out of here?

Side_12
What's your mother's name?

Person_1
Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her
home.

Side_13
Mr. Fleck, your mother had a
stroke. It's very serious. You
can't "check her out." She's gonna
be here for at least a week.

Person_1
She's not gonna wanna stay that
long. She doesn't like hospitals.
Or doctors.

Side_13
I'm sorry to hear that. But she
can't just leave.

Person_1
I don't like hospitals either.

Side_13
Listen, I wanted to talk you about
something we noticed in her tox
report. We found heavy traces of
multiple medications in her system.

Person_1
Okay. Thanks.

Side_13
One of them's perphenazine. It's a
powerful anti-psychotic. If she was
taking that regularly and then
suddenly stopped, the withdrawal
could have contributed to her
stroke. Did you notice any
symptoms?

Person_1
Symptoms?

Side_13
Withdrawal symptoms. Nausea...
anxiety... hallucinations.

Side_13
Do you know how long she's been
taking it?

Person_1
Can you tell me what those symptoms
are again?

Side_14
PERFORMANCE. Joker on stage smiling behind the microphone,
under the harsh spotlight.

Side_15
-- I'm sorry to bother you, but can
you settle an argument for us?

Person_1
Excuse me?

Side_15
You were the guy on Murray Franklin
last night, right?

Person_1
No, sorry. Wasn't me.

Side_15
Except you weren't funny. You
didn't tell any jokes.

Person_1
I don't know what you're talking
about.

Side_15
No. It was definitely you, buddy.
You're the guy who couldn't stop
laughing. Murray killed you.

Person_1
If I were you, I'd walk away from
this table before I strangle all
three of you with that fucking
stethoscope hanging from your neck.

Side_16
WAYNE HALL, behind steel barricades. Many wearing Joker's
"clown face" mask... A few wave homemade signs, "CLOWN FOR

Person_1 MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK
WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold-
out black-tie audience--

Side_18
Can I help you, pal?

Person_1
What? Yeah. No I, I--

Side_18
You need to get in here or
something?

Person_1
Dad. It's me.

Side_18
Excuse me?

Person_1
My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
I know you didn't know about me,
and I don't want anything from you.
Well... maybe a hug.

Side_18
Jesus? You're the guy who came by
my house yesterday.

Person_1
Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
wouldn't let me see you. So I came
here. I have so many questions.

Side_18
Look pal, I'm not your father.
What's wrong with you?

Person_1
How do you know?

Side_18
Cause you were adopted. And I never
fucked your mother. What do you
want from me, money?

Person_1
No. What? I wasn't adopted.

Side_18
She never told you? Your mother
adopted you before she even started
working for us. She was arrested
when you were four years old and
committed to Arkham State Hospital.
She's batshit crazy.

Person_1
No. No, I don't believe that.

Side_18
I don't really give a shit   what you
believe.
But if you ever come to my   house
again, if you ever talk to   my son
again, if I ever even hear   about
you again, I'll--

Side_18
Are you laughing at me?

Side_18
You think this is funny?

Person_1
(tries shaking his head
no; still laughing and
choking)
No, no I have a con--

Side_18
(interrupting; raising his
voice)
Is this a fucking joke to you?

Person_1
Sophie?

Side_19
Sorry for the wait. All our records
that are 10 years or older are
stored in the basement. You're
talking over 30 years ago,-- I had
to do some serious digging.

Side_19
Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
still gonna need a release from
her.

Person_1
Can I ask you a question? How does
someone wind up in here? Have all
these people committed crimes?

Side_19
Some have. Some are just crazy and
pose a danger to themselves or
others. Some just got nowhere else
to go.

Person_1
Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
I don't know what to do, y'know, I
don't think I can take any more of
this.

Side_19
Yeah, I can't take much more of
this shit either.

Side_19
Now they talking about more
layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
do.

Person_1
Last time I ended up taking it out
on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
thought it would bother me but, it
really hasn't.

Side_19
What's that?

Person_1
It's just so hard to try and be
happy all the time, y'know, when
everything's going to shit all
around you.

Side_19
Listen, I'm just an administrative
assistant, like a clerk. I file
paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
really know what to tell you, but
maybe you should see someone-- they
have programs, like city services.

Person_1
Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
just talking to talk.

Side_19
Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.

Person_1
(saying it out loud for
himself to hear)
So she was a patient here.

Side_19
Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin
Stoner... The patient suffers from
delusional psychosis and
narcissistic personality
disorder... Found guilty of
endangering the welfare of a child--

Person_1
What?

Side_19
You said she's your mother?

Side_19
I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
can't release this without the
proper forms. I could get in
trouble.
Besides, it's pretty bad.

Person_1
I can handle bad. I've been on a
pretty bad run myself.

Side_19
I can't help you. If you want these
records you have to get your mom to
sign a patient disclosure form. I
can have someone mail you one.

Side_20
We went over this, Penny. You
adopted him. We have all the
paperwork right here.

Side_20
You also stood by as one of your
boyfriends repeatedly abused your
adopted son. And battered you.

Person_5
He didn't do anything to me. Or to
my boy. Can I go now, I don't like
hospitals.

Person_5
That's not true. My apartment
wasn't filthy. I keep a clean
house.

Side_20
And what do you have to say about
your son?

Person_5
I'm just glad I got to know him.

Person_4
What the hell was that? You can't
just walk into my apartment like
that.

Person_1
No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get
through this, that's why I'm here.

Person_4
What are you talking about? What do
you think this is?

Person_1
I don't know. I mean I've never
been with a woman "like that," but,
this feels like a beginning to me.

Person_4
Arthur, I was just being nice to
you. I felt sorry for you. I have a
boyfriend.

Person_1
You what? What? What kind of woman
are you? Who does that?

Person_4
You need to leave. I'm not having
this conversation with you.

Person_1
Why not?

Person_4
Go back with your friends, honey.
Mommy's having a grown up talk.

Person_1
No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you
need to hear this. Your mother's a
bad person. She's a whore, she's
seeing two men at once. You can't
trust her,-- She'll break your
fucking heart.

Person_1
How come nothing ever comes easy
for me?

Person_1
Who is this?

Person_1
Yes.

Person_1
Murray wants me to come on the
show?

Person_1
Ma, remember how you used to tell
me that God gave me this laugh for
a reason. That I had a purpose. To
bring laughter and joy into this
fucked up world,--

Person_1
HA! It wasn't God, it was you or,
or one of your boyfriends,-- how
could you let that happen? What
kind of woman are you? What kind of
mother are you?

Person_1
What's my real name?

Person_1
C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted.
What's my name? Who am I really?

Person_5
H-h-happ--

Person_1
(interrupting, snaps at
her)

Person_1
Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't
been happy for one minute of my
entire fucking life.

Person_1
But you know what's funny? You know
what really makes me laugh?

Person_1
I used to think my life was nothing
but a tragedy, but now, now I
realize it's all just a fucking
comedy.

Person_1
You wanna hear a joke, Murray?

Person_1
Knock-knock.

Person_1
Yeah, I don't know if I should
cross or uncross 'em. Both feel
completely unnatural.

Person_1
Thanks for having me on, Murray. I
can't tell you how much this means
to me, it's been a life long dream.
I have a joke for you--

Person_1
You're right. You're right,
uncrossed is better.

Person_1
(wiping his eyes;
restrained anger)
You shouldn't be here. It's not
right.

Side_10
We just came to pay our respects.
Sorry about your mother.

Side_11
Yeah, it's too bad.

Side_11
Where is everybody?

Person_1
It's always been just me and her.

Side_11
We saw you on Murray Franklin.

Person_1
You saw that?

Side_10
Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got
a videotape.

Side_11
I just couldn't tell if you were
actually trying to be funny or not.

Person_1
Yeah, well I guess you didn't get
the joke.

Side_10
Listen, we need to clear a few
things up, we spoke to the hospital
administrator--

Person_1
Which hospital?

Side_11
The Children's Hospital.
The night you were fired. He said
it didn't look like a prop gun, it
was heavy, like a real one. We have
some more questions for you.

Person_1
I just buried my mother.

Side_10
We can do it tomorrow. But you need
to come down to the precinct--
first thing in the morning.

Person_1
(looks down, reading the
card)
Right. Thanks for coming.

Side_11
Of course.

Person_1
That was a joke.

Person_8
Hey Arthur, how's it going? You get
a new gig?

Person_7
You must be goin' down to that
rally at City Hall. Right? I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

Person_1
Is that today?

Person_7
Yeah. What's with the clown-face
then?

Person_1
My mom died.

Person_7
Yeah we heard. That's why we're
here. Figured you might wanna go
out, get a drink or something?

Person_8
We don't wanna bother you. Randall
just thought we should come and pay
our respects.

Person_7
Yeah, we're family. We gotta stick
together.

Person_1
It's not a good time. I'm in the
middle of something here.

Person_8
Of course. No problem. Another
time.

Person_7
Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,--
one other thing--

Person_7
Listen, the cops have been poking
around the shop, they're talking to
all the clowns about those subway
murders and--

Person_8
They didn't talk to me.

Person_7
That's because the suspect was a
regular-sized person. If it was a
fucking midget you'd be in jail
right now.
Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking
for me, and, and I just wanna see
what you said. You know, make sure
our stories line up, bein' that
you're my boy and--

Person_8
What the fuck what the fuck WHAT

Person_1
I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you
believe it?

Person_1
It's okay, Gary. You can go.

Person_8
Hey, Art?

Side_21
PANTS, pocketing all the cash.

Side_22
glimpse Joker's hand reaching for it--

Person_1
Go on. Go. You're free.

Side_23
before scampering off out into the world, leaving him behind
for good.

Side_10
Hey Arthur, where you going?

Side_11
Yeah, thought you were coming down
to the station this morning.

Side_24
Side_25
--You gotta see this nut for
yourself, Murray. I don't think we
can put him on. With the rioting
out there.

Side_26
Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for
this. Cindy's been breaking my
balls all day.

Side_25
She's still mad at you about that
thing?

Side_26
Three marriages, you'd think I'da
fuckin' learned something.
What do I gotta see? I already know
he's a nut. That's why we're
putting him on, it's a goof.

Side_25
(just shakes his head, and
smiles)
I'm telling you, you gotta see him,
Murray. I think it's too risky, the
show's too big. It's worth too much
to blow it on this,-- this freak.

Person_1
(shakes Murray's hand;
effusive)
Murray, I can't believe this is
real, that I'm really here.

Side_25
It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some
respect.

Side_26
Oh shut up, Gene.
Murray is fine. I prefer it in
fact. Thanks for coming on the
show.

Person_1
Are you kidding? Thank you for the
opportunity. I've been watching you
forever. My mother never missed a
show.

Side_26
So what's with the face? Are you
part of the protests?

Person_1
No, I don't believe in any of that.
I don't believe in anything. I just
thought it would be good for my
act.

Side_25
Your act? Didn't you hear that a
kid got killed on the subway and
two cops who were almost beat to
death? You didn't hear about the
dozens of protestors and police
injured in the riots?

Person_1
No. I hadn't heard.

Side_25
--the audience is gonna go crazy if
you put him on. It was okay maybe
for a bit, but not a whole segment.

Side_26
I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
It's, it's dangerous. The best
comedy is all those things put
together.
We're gonna go with it.

Person_1
Thank you Murray.

Side_26
(flashes his bemused
smile; condescending)
Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
no off-color material, we do a
clean show, okay? You'll be on
after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
and get you. Good?

Person_1
Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
you bring me out, can you introduce
me as "The Joker"?

Side_25
What? You don't want to use your
real name?

Person_1
Honestly, I don't even know what my
real name is.

Person_1
Besides, that's what you called me
on the show, Murray. A joker.
Remember?

Side_26
(to Gene; trying not to
crack up)
Did I?

Side_25
I have no idea.

Side_26
Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
is.

Side_26
You gotta see our next guest for
yourself. Will you stick around?
Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
he could use a doctor.

Side_27
Oh. Does he have sexual problems?

Side_26
He looks like he's got a lot of
problems.

Side_26
It's been a crazy few days here in
Gotham, and, I think maybe things
are about to get crazy around here
too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
be right back.

Side_28
Back in 30 seconds.

Side_29
Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
it straight out of break.

Side_28
Five... Four... Three...

Side_29
Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.

Side_26
O-kay, you may have seen that clip
of our next guest when we first
played it two weeks ago. Now before
he comes out, I just want to say
that we're all heartbroken here and
sensitive to what's going on in the
city tonight. But, this is how he
wanted to come on the show. So let
me introduce-- The Joker.

Side_26
So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
show. But I gotta tell ya, with
what happened at City Hall today,
I'm sure many of our viewers here
in the studio, and at home, might
find this look of yours in poor
taste.

Side_26
Can you tell us why you're dressed
like this?

Side_26
(can't help but smile at
Joker's laughing)
Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
this is funny. A lot of those
protesters are going with this
look. City seems to be full of
clowns these days.

Person_1
(just nods, still
laughing)
Yeah. Isn't it great?

Side_30
This guy's got nothing.

Side_29
(hits the producer's talk
button; into the mic)
Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
this?

Side_26
(smiles; trying to save
the interview)
So when we talked earlier, you
mentioned that you aren't
political. That this look isn't a
political statement.

Person_1
That's right. I'm not political,
Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
to make people laugh.

Side_26
How's that goin' for ya? Have you
been working on any new material?
Do you want to tell us a joke?

Side_26
You brought a joke book?

Person_1
Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.

Side_26
Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
need to read it?

Person_1
I want to get it right. Knock
knock.

Side_26
Who's there?

Person_1
(looks up from his
notebook)
It's the police, ma'am. Your son
has been hit by a drunk driver.
He's dead.

Side_29
Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
Ready Three. Three.

Side_26
(bemused smile;
patronizing)
Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
told me backstage that your
mother's a big fan of the show,
that she never misses it.

Person_1
That's right, Murray. But she's
dead now.

Side_26
(goes along with the
"joke")
Hold on. Your mother's dead?

Person_1
Yeah. She is.

Side_26
Okay. What about your father? Does
he watch the show?

Person_1
I don't know who my father is,
Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
sexually assaulted by my mother's
boyfriend.

Side_27
Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
about that.

Side_26
(shakes his head;
irritated)
Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
the kind of humor we do on this
show.

Person_1
(just keeps going, on a
roll)
Sorry. It's been a rough few
months, Murray. I mean, after my
mother died, the police came to
question me at her funeral. Who
does that?

Side_26
Oh really? Were you a suspect?

Person_1
Very funny, Murray. No, they came
because I killed those three Wall
Street guys.

Side_26
Okay. I'm waiting for the
punchline.

Person_1
There is no punchline. It's not a
joke.

Side_29
Did he just confess to killing the
Wall Street Three?

Side_30
Yeah. I think he did.

Side_28
(turns to the director,
nods)
He definitely did.

Side_29
Jesus Christ.
(hits the camera talk
button, into mic)
Camera Three, get in close.

Side_26
(turns back to Joker; with
gravitas)
You're serious, aren't you? You're
telling us you killed those three
boys on the subway. Why should we
believe you?

Person_1
I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
is my fate, it was always my fate.
My life is nothing but a comedy.

Side_26
Okay, I think I understand. You did
it to start a movement, to become a
symbol.

Person_1
C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
kind of clown who could start a
movement? I killed those guys
because they were awful.
Everybody's awful these days. It's
enough to make anyone crazy.

Side_26
So that's it, you're crazy. That's
your defense for killing three
young men? Because they were mean
to you?

Person_1
No. They couldn't carry a tune to
save their lives.

Person_1
Why is everyone so upset about
these guys? Because Thomas Wayne
went and cried about them on TV?

Side_26
You have a problem with Thomas
Wayne, too?

Person_1
Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
easy for him.

Side_26
And what's wrong with that?

Person_1
Have you seen what it's like out
there, Murray? Do you ever actually
leave the studio? Everybody just
yells and screams at each other.
Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
thinks what it's like to be the
other guy. You think men like
Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
think what it's like to be a guy
like me? To be anybody but
themselves.
(shaking his head, voice
rising)
They don't. They think we'll all
just sit there and take it like
good little boys. That we won't
werewolf and go wild. Well, this is
for all of you out there.

Side_31
That asshole just confessed to
killing those Wall Street guys on
fucking live TV!

Person_1
You're awful, Murray.

Side_26
Me? How am I awful?

Person_1
Playing my video, inviting me on
the show,-- You just wanted to make
fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh
at Frankenstein on a crowded beach,
isn't it? You're just like the rest
of them, Murray. Everything comes
too easy for you.

Side_26
You don't know the first thing
about me, pal. Look what happened
because of what you did, Arthur,
what it led to. There are riots out
there. Two policemen are in
critical condition, someone was
killed today.

Person_1
How about another joke, Murray?
What do you get when you cross a
mentally-ill loner with a system
that abandons him and treats him
like trash?

Person_1
I'll tell you what you get. You get
what you fucking deserve,--

Side_32
GUARDS AND SOME STAGEHANDS, still hear screams of terror from
the audience around him.

Side_33
reports of rioters in "Joker" masks setting fires, breaking
windows, looting stores.

Side_34
STOP. Smoke rising from the wreck. Ferrante & Teicher's piano
only version of "Send in the Clowns" still playing...

Side_35
You still think we're all fucking
clowns?

Side_36
What's so funny?

Person_1
-- just thinking of this joke.

Side_36
Do you want to tell it to me?

Person_1
No.

Side_36
Because you don't think I'll get
it?

Person_1
Because it's personal, it's between
me and him.

Side_36
Okay. Is the medication working?
How's your sleeping?

Person_1
Side_36
How are you feeling?

Person_1
Good. Everything's good now.

Side_36
Have you been writing in your
journal?

Side_36
Great. I want to make sure you're
keeping up with it.

Person_1
Yeah.

Side_36
Have you written about your
episode? About what happened?

Person_1
How I remember it.

Side_36
Can I see?

Person_1
I suppose we could just sack him.

Person_1
Look, I don't hate the man but ...

Person_2
I know, Gareth. It's the mental strain he inflicts on us all.
How is Professor Bradbury

Person_2
Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert?

Person_3
Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak,
Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and
running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than ....
useful?

Person_4
Morning, Bean.

Person_1
Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks
and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell
him.

Person_3
Seconded.     We could all move to France.

Person_5
All those in favour.

Person_2
Come on - settle down everyone.

Person_6
I'm sorry I'm late.

Person_6
Steady on, old man. I only ...

Person_1
Not you, you idiot.

Person_7
Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.
Circa 1670. Can do?

Person_7
What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art
stored in that one, curious brain of yours.

Person_1
Then we are agreed, gentlemen.   He goes.

Person_6
Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render
Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete.

Person_3
There's no question.

Person_2
Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking
the pills.

Person_2
Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom,
please.

Person_2
invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second
one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?

Person_2
Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you
still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge.
Your invaluable thoughts, sir?

Person_8
Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question.

Person_7
Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius.

Person_9
Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom.

Side_1
What's happening here?

Side_2
Ahm...

Side_2
Ah.... Ahm....

Person_2
You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the

Person_2
Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news
which will not, I'm afraid...

Person_2
Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How?
All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long
will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here
will    you, dear boy.

Person_2
As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South
California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it

Person_2
Mr. Bean.     Wonderful news. You are going to America.

Side_3
Ooooh, how lovely.

Person_2
Ah, Timothy.    You're sacked.

Side_4
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in
the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.

Side_5
Great news.

Side_6
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then

Side_7
Here we go, sir. You've been moved to l st. class. Apparently
your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're
finally on your way.

Side_4
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your
home instead of some expensive hotel.

Side_5
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period.

Side_4
David?

Side_8
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really
like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't
really er ...

Side_4
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate
attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial

Side_8
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my
family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course
it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?

Side_4
Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that?

Side_8
No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it.

Side_8
Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with
Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
more.

Side_9
Hello, David.

Side_8
Side_10
I had to do some last minute stuff.

Side_9
My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you,
gallery going well?

Side_8
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I
think it ....

Side_10
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.

Side_10
Kevin!   You stop that right now!

Side_9
Great kids.     Good looking too.

Side_8
You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,
looks-wise.

Side_8
Ah ... absolutely.

Side_10
Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get
into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before
the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.

Side_10
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin

Side_8
Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's
coming to work at the Gallery, from England...

Side_8
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a
while.

Side_10
There aren't hotels?

Side_8
Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for
him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all
that stuff.

Side_8
I said I'd check with you.

Side_8
Then I said 'yes'.

Side_10
Do we know anything about him?

Side_8
Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ...      at least
2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind
dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the
time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here.

Side_10
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

Side_8
Side_10
It's the last thing we need.

Side_8
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a
sensational idea."

Side_11
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....

Side_8
Great, good.

Side_8
Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back?     Years ago?
No. Course not. Just imagining it.

Side_12
Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.

Side_13
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are
ugly.

Side_8
What makes you say that?

Side_13
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan
Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony
Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two
million bucks a year to stay indoors.

Side_8
Richard Burton was very good-looking.

Side_13
Welsh.

Side_8
Sean Connery.

Side_10
Scottish.

Side_8
Tom Jones?

Side_13
Welsh again.

Side_8
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.    No-one's
asking you to go to bed with him.

Side_10
Bed sounds good though.    Bed sounds great.

Side_11
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

Side_8
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

Side_11
I vote for Bart.

Side_13
Shut up, Kevin.

Side_11
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something
about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad?
Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11
mosquitoes, resting.

Side_13
You know the thing I hate most about children?

Side_11
Nope.

Side_13
You.

Side_14
Police!   Stop or we shoot!

Side_14
Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers
only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back!

Side_15
Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of medication at all?

Side_15
You could certainly use some.

Side_10
What did they say?

Side_8
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...

Side_10
Did you really ask?

Side_8
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

Side_10
What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse
me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and
I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
I'll go.

Side_10
I said, I'11 go.

Side_13
So. where do your parents live?

Side_16
My parents are dead.

Side_13
Yeah, so are mine.

Side_14
Just get him the hell out of here, will ya?

Side_17
Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
ya know that?

Side_10
It isn't working any more, David.

Side_8
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.
Stupid thing.

Side_10
No, US.     It's not working any longer -you and me.

Side_8
Jesus.

Side_10
I need some time, David. A little time.        It's not just you.
It's partly me.

Side_13
Thanks a lot, Kevin!

Side_8
That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London
Airport!

Side_18
ALISON is still watching T.V. The volume is getting to DAVID.

Side_8
Alison, please.

Side_8
I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's
important.

Side_10
Go ahead.

Side_8
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

Side_10
There were three strawberries.

Side_8
One.

Side_10
Liar.

Side_8
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.

Side_8
Ali?    What's wrong?

Side_10
Your face smells like a foot.

Side_10
What is it?    Jennifer!

Side_8
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...

Side_13
There's a man.    I woke up next to a man ...

Side_10
Side_8
It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust
me.

Side_10
He can't stay here, David.

Side_8
Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the
gallery ...

Side_10
David, I'm serious!

Side_8
I know you are.   Very serious ... most of the time these days.

Side_10
Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man
in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? (looks at his
tie) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?

Side_8
Ah, Mr Bean ...

Side_2
Excuse me.

Side_2
Now - can I help?

Side_19
Two dollars please.

Side_8
Annie, it's me.

Side_19
Side_8
No, Annie, no.    This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with
us.

Side_19
Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but
for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which
is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.

Side_19
He doesn't like to say much does he?

Side_8
Right first time.

Side_19
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.

Side_8
You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes
worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep
aesthetic level.

Side_12 1
What do you think?

Side_12 2
0h yes - lovely - very nice.

Side_12 1
And what colour would you use for the curtains?

Side_12 2
Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a
gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom
would be nice in this yellow ....

Side_8
Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96.
Know it?

Side_19
Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you
upstairs.

Side_8
Thanks, Annie.

Side_8
Better go.    Grierson hates people being late.

Side_2
Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ...

Side_8
Why me?

Side_8
Come on!     Let's go!

Side_4
must be our professor from across the sea.

Side_8
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.

Side_2
Actually I'm not .... er ...

Side_4
This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.

Side_22
Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....

Side_4
Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your
eyes on these.

Side_4
Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check
this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
something?

Side_8.
They're beautiful, sir.

Side_4
Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to
business.

Side_4
Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery
computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very
exciting stuff ....

Side_2
Ahm ... NO.

Side_5
What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'
interactive public guide to the gallery.

Side_8
It's very good Bernie.

Side_5
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work
oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the
program to every room in the gallery.

Side_4
Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?

Side_4
Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice
President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm,
yes, Doctor?

Side_2
I'm not actually... um...

Side_4
... Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps
you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.

Side_5
Absolutely.     This way, sir.

Side_4
He's a genius, right?

Side_8
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

Side_4
Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's
job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

Side_8
Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have
him with us. The whole family's very excited.

Side_4
Glad to hear it.     Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?

Side_8
You're not going to ....

Side_4
Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not,
repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this
morning?

Side_8
You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir.

Side_8
Goodnight Annie.

Side_19
Night.

Side_24
Gimme the keys!

Side_24
I said, give me the keys!

Side_24
But I haven't got a f.....

Side_2
Ssssh!!!!

Side_24
I haven't got a gun.

Side_24
Okay, okay, I'11 do it!

Side_14
Excuse me.    Mr. er ... Cabbage?

Side_15
It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.

Side_15
Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got
the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking

Side_15
'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.

Side_15
Mr. Bean.     You lookin' to stay long in California?

Side_3
Oh, yes.

Side_8
He was incredible.     This guy is fearless.     He has no fear.

Side_11
That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is
brainless he has no brain'.

Side_8
Well, there is that ...

Side_2
Ahm....

Side_11
It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and
I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.

Side_11
Come on, winkle.

Side_11
It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the
stupid cuckoo.

Side_2
Click, click, click, click, click ...

Side_11
How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!!

Side_11
Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!

Side_8
Hi,

Side_10
Side_8
Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner
that will kill you.

Side_10
putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?

Side_8
Sort of half.....

Side_10
Meaning?

Side_8
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have
asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

Side_10
Honestly David, you're so spineless.

Side_8
Roses.     Wine.

Side_10
But no real change.

Side_10
I really do need some time on my own. Away from here.

Side_8
Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak.
You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.

Side_10
Side_8
Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer -
could you turn that damn thing down.

Side_10
No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ...

Side_11
I wish I    could use    that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard
feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used
to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you
around in    a couple    of years, maybe".

Side_13
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.

Side_8
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?

Side_13
It's you and Mom that need to talk.

Side_8
Sure.    You're right.

Side_11
You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are
you, Dad?

Side_11
Are you?

Side_8
Yes, I am.    I must.

Side_2
Enter.

Side_8
Hi, am I disturbing you?

Side_8
May I?

Side_8
None of your folks here - Family?

Side_8
Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've
been here twelve all...

Side_8
Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do
it) ... to say good night. Okay?

Side_8
Spineless.

Side_8
Bean can I ask you something?

Side_8
Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've
known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?

Side_8
I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame.
She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the
flesh?

Side_8
I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but'
let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great
works of art is true, huh?

Side_8
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody
gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?

Side_25
Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like
my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with
her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.

Side_8
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me
David?

Side_25
Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm
calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're
my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.

Side_8
You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that
works the night shift.

Side_8
Stay there.    Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.

Side_8
Right.   Open now.

Side_8
I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want
to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave
the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.

Side_2
What the ... !!!

Side_26
Second floor.

Side_27
I guess I'll see you up there, guys.

Side_26
Third floor.

Side_5
I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project
today.

Side_8
Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy,
you know?

Side_5
Howls he getting on with the family?

Side_8
Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great.

Side_5
And howls Alison?

Side_8
She's ... well, she's good.

Side_5
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.
Nice guy. Good looking.

Side_8
Yes, isn't he.

Side_8
Isn't it?

Side_5
I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even
though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
way, huh?

Side_8
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -
always a subtle joy.

Side_5
Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.

Side_5
By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the
balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or
we're all in the
crap house. What     do you think?

Side_8
'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

Side_5
comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll
hear soon enough.

Side_19
True love can be very hard.

Side_8
gone?

Side_2
Ahm.....

Side_8
What?    What?

Side_8
Oh Jesus. Oh God.     Oh Jesus God.   Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh
Jesus of Nazareth.

Side_2
oh dear.

Side_8
What happened?!!!

Side_2
Ahm.... (setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive
answer).

Side_8
Side_8
Brilliant.   Brilliant. Problem solved!

Side_4
Ah, David.   Showing Dr. Bean our good lady?

Side_2
Actually I'm not a...

Side_8
That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his
father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying
doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes.

Side_4
Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself...

Side_8
No!

Side_4
Er ... pray tell me why?

Side_25
Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why.

Side_25
I better continue my rounds, sir..

Side_8
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very
thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel
the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.

Side_4
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?

Side_8
Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she,
Bean?

Side_2
Oh yes.

Side_8
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of
paints ....

Side_4
Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth

Side_8
... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In
fact I'll go right now.

Side_4
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've
decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

Side_4
Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current
Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to
inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think
decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you?

Side_8
Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo.

Side_8
Bean.   Do you drink?

Side_8
Neither do I.

Side_8
It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -
lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?

Side_8
I guess not.

Side_8
He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?

Side_8
... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an
artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a
figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the
problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before
I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.

Side_8
Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.
Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.
Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I
should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I
tell you something, Beanie ...

Side_8
Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?

Side_8
So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you
understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been
better if I'd never been born.

Side_28
Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut.

Side_8
0 my God. Tell it vas a dream.

Side_2
Morning.

Side_8
It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them
Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

Side_8
What?

Side_4
I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever
looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.

Side_8
Ahm....

Side_4
Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want
anything to go wrong.

Side_8
Quite right, sir.

Side_8
Wait a minute.

Side_2
Ssshhhh.

Side_13
Bye, Dad.

Side_8
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen?

Side_13
Be serious, Dad.    It's Saturday.

Side_8
Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and
with your mom away ... I really need you.

Side_16
You.

Side_13
Don't worry, Dad.    I'll be home. Monday, after school.

Side_11
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna
look just like its handsome driver.

Side_8
Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this
family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!
Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.

Side_13
And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a
family till you get Mom back.

Side_13
Come on Sting!

Side_11
Sting?!   Sounds like something you put on a rash.

Side_8
Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.

Side_8
To BEAN )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!
the car!     Both of you. Jesus!

Side_19
So, Kevin.    How's it going?

Side_11
Badly.    You wanna adopt me?

Side_19
Big day today, huh?

Side_8
Uh ... yes ...

Side_5
Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and
concentrating on the future.

Side_8
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we
haven't been doing as badly as all that.

Side_8
Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after
Bean.

Side_11
My Dad told me all about you.

Side_19
Did he now?

Side_11
He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain
cell count of about two and a half.

Side_19
Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually.

Side_11
must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't
do anything.

Side_4
Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David?

Side_8
Certainly is.

Side_5
We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to
every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the
Governor.

Side_4
Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a
winning team.

Side_11
This is way cool, Beanie.

Side_5
Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who
actually gets things done.

Side_8
You arrange those flowers yourself?

Side_25
Sure did.

Side_8
They're pretty.   Learn it in the army?

Side_25
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands,
you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

Side_4
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of

Side_5
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.

Side_4
Right.    Got it.

Side_19
Good day, Governor Reynolds. I'm Annie ...

Side_5
Curtsy.

Side_19
Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s America.      Women don't
curtsy, they run the damn country!

Side_4
Alex, please!

Side_19
That's Annie, sir.

Side_4
This is Elmer, our longest serving...

Side_5
Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans'
reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him
of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.

Side_8
David Leary. I'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and
thank you for your patronage ...

Side_5
Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour.       We have
to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!

Side_4
Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a
little smartening up to do myself.

Side_11
I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,

Side_29
Side_30
A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" BEAN tries something 0 else.
The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making
BEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.

Side_5
How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?

Side_5
We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more.
Period. Oh, And put this on.

Side_5
David?   Lift off!

Side_4
what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.

Side_31
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s
reunion after.

Side_4
Not at all, Governor.    Very striking.

Side_31
Interesting suit.

Side_4
Why thank you sir.

Side_31
off the peg?

Side_4
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

Side_31
Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.

Side_5
Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.

Side_19
Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller
than you were half an hour ago.

Side_31
Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much.

Side_19
Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does
she 0 have a decent job?

Side_31
Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine.

Side_31
Nice set of medals there Elmer.      Which beach they drop you on?
Utah? Omaha?

Side_25
Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I
didn't know where I was.

Side_31
Well, congratulations soldier.

Side_4
Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the
established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?

Side_31
Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you
got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?

Side_5
Everything okay, David?

Side_8
Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had
got to.

Side_5
He's just parking the Governor's car.

Side_8
Great - keep him out of trouble.

Side_31
Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now?      My eyes are making my feet
sore, as my wife would say.

Side_8
Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way.

Side_8
Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother
before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.

Side_8
I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with
his new friend.

Side_31
Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to
me - or should I say ten million dollars!

Side_4
Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it

Side_8
Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
England.

Side_2
Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...

Side_31
You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten
million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!?

Side_4
Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks

Side_8
Nice try, kiddo.

Side_19
David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife.

Side_8
Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a
date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.

Side_19
She's calling from the hospital ...

Side_19
She's on line three!

Side_19
Such... great buns.

Side_31
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more
intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect
your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even
know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who
sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you
guys.

Side_4
I am sorry you feel that way.

Side_31
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.     That suit stinks and
you obviously dye your hair.

Side_5
Certainly, sir.

Side_15
Come on man!     Move it!

Side_25
Hey, Cop, wanna ride?       Jeese, where do they get you guys?

Side_5
There is one other tiny problem, sir.

Side_11
Is Jenny gonna be okay?

Side_8
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

Side_11
But is she gonna be okay?

Side_8
Side_8
Damn! She's a good kid. Sometimes good people get a break once

Side_25
It's okay!    I'll tail 'em!

Side_15
You got it.

Side_8
Just stay away from me!   D'you hear?

Side_31
Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way
of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass.

Side_10
They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just
a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while.

Side_8
Excuse me.

Side_32
I'll be back in a minute.

Side_8
Okay, great.

Side_10
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.

Side_8
Ah, well ....

Side_33
Doctor Jacobson?

Side_34
Yes?

Side_33
We need you urgently in C Theatre.

Side_34
Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 ....

Side_33
It is urgent, sir.

Side_34
Okay.....

Side_25
No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now.

Side_25
Buck?

Side_33 2
Doctor ... Bean?

Side_2
Side_33 2
Just in time, sir.     Allow me.

Side_10
When the Police told me what had happened I ... it's stupid I know
... but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to
coma victims ...

Side_11
Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee
grinders?

Side_10
That right.   So I went home and picked it up.

Side_8
Side_36
Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the
lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's
severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.

Side_33 2
He's coming round.

Side_36
Give him a T 70, straight away.

Side_36
Shall I do the cut, sir?

Side_36
I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

Side_33
I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll
never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
systems.

Side_36
so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all
better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.

Side_37
Any news on the chief?.

Side_36
There certainly is.    Dr Bean here just saved his life.

Side_10
0 my god.

Side_8
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

Side_10
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

Side_8
Excuse me.

Side_38
Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to
deal with here, sir.

Side_10
Excuse me, doctor.

Side_39
Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.

Side_10
Okay.

Side_8
Say that again, son.

Side_39
I beg your pardon?

Side_8
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll
make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less
healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.

Side_39
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

Side_8
We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the
Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end
of the world.

Side_8
and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going
to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence
and    attention you    are    going to give her case.

Side_39
Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good.

Side_8
Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will
you?

Side_10
Smiling         Well, well.

Side_10
Let's get a coffee.

Side_8
Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.

Side_11
Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna
wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire
bats.

Side_10
Disgusting.

Side_8
Everything's gonna be fine.

Side_10
About Charles...

Side_8
shhh...

Side_10
It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was
the last time we laughed? Any of us?

Side_8
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular
proportions. Olympic standard.

Side_11
Dad...

Side_11
These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ...

Side_40
Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down
the hall that could use ...

Side_8
Side_10
in you, my' man?

Side_10
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.

Side_8
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

Side_8
I thought you said....

Side_8
Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you
hear me? Come on now...

Side_13
Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom?

Side_11
I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back
from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do
not lie!

Side_8
Here, let me do that.

Side_10
No, I'm fine.

Side_2
Side_10
Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready.

Side_10
There.     Is that how you like them?

Side_10
He's not too bad.       I can live with him.

Side_8
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale
to tell. And not a happy one.

Side_4
Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday
teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would
have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent
philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself
for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell
her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership
flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
President.

Side_4
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and
the 21st century.

Side_5
Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we
can ...

Side_4
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?
Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we
find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a
criminal of great genius.

Side_4
Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!

Side_4
The best security in the world is no match for a master
criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank
you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new
Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the
computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were
so rudely interrupted by events.

Side_4
David, David, David ...

Side_8
I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?

Side_4
Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,
relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,
through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I
trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

Side_4
I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie
will.

Side_4
Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation
for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
bathroom.

Side_4
How are you making out there?

Side_5
All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be
quite a show.

Side_5
Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother.

Side_5
Just click on the corner.

Side_5
Right let me take over now...

Side_5
You've had long enough on it now.       A joke's a joke.   That's it.
Period!

Side_5
You can stop right there, Mr! Those are confidential ...

Side_2
Daaa!   Daaa!

Side_5
Excuse me, If I may just ...

Side_4
Shut up, Schimmel. Exactly how long have you been siphoning
gallery money into your own private accounts?

Side_8
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all
completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...

Side_5
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

Side_4
Horse shit.   You're dead, grease-ball.   Period.

Side_5
But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn
you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably
typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit
There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me
up!

Side_4
Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that?

Side_2
Side_4
I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd

Side_41
Oh, yeah - I forgot.

Side_4
I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
you do not.

Side_8
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

Side_4
Of course.

Side_8
And a car.

Side_4
Mmmmm...

Side_8
Maybe two cars.

Side_4
A car sounds sensible.

Side_8
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.
Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
time to make up.

Side_10
well, it's been... unusual. But thank you.

Side_13
Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time.

Side_8
Come on          hurry or we'll be late.

Side_8
... Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National. Said
good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,
huh?

Side_11
Good-bye Beanie. It's Bean .... surreal.          And don't forget you're
welcome to come back anytime ...

Side_11
... in the distant future.

Side_8
Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?      I know
it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

Side_42
They've moved, guy.

Person_2
Is he gone?

Person_9
Yes, my lord.

Person_2
Tell the others.

Person_9
Very well, my lord.

Person_9
He's gone.

<title>THE BIG LEBOWSKI</title>
</head>
<pre>

Person_3
A way out west there was a fella,
fella I want to tell you about, fella
by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At
least, that was the handle his lovin'
parents gave him, but he never had
much use for it himself.  This
Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.  But
then, there was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make a whole lot of sense
to me.  And a lot about where he
lived, like- wise.  But then again,
maybe that's why I found the place
s'durned innarestin'.

Person_3
They call Los Angeles the City of
Angels.  I didn't find it to be that
exactly, but I'll allow as there are
some nice folks there.  'Course, I
can't say I seen London, and I never
been to France, and I ain't never
seen no queen in her damn undies as
the fella says.  But I'll tell you
what, after seeing Los Angeles and
thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any
a those other places, and in English
too, so I can die with a smile on my
face without feelin' like the good
Lord gypped me.

Person_3
Now this story I'm about to unfold
took place back in the early nineties--
just about the time of our conflict
with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I
only mention it 'cause some- times
there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,
'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes
there's a man.

Person_3
And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--
sometimes there's a man who, wal,
he's the man for his time'n place,
he fits right in there--and that's
the Dude, in Los Angeles.

Person_4
This aggression will not stand. . .
This will not stand!

Person_3
...and even if he's a lazy man, and
the Dude was certainly that--quite
possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
County.

Person_3
...which would place him high in the
runnin' for laziest worldwide--but
sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes
there's a man.

Person_3
Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.
But--aw hell, I done innerduced him
enough.

Person_5
It's the LeBaron.

Person_6
We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny
said you were good for it.

Person_6
Where's the money, Lebowski!

Person_6
Where's the money, Lebowski!

Person_5
It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
Lemme take another look.

Person_6
Don't fuck with us.  If your wife
owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that
means you owe money to Jackie
Treehorn.

Person_7
Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

Person_5
Oh, man.  Don't do--

Person_8
You see what happens?  You see what
happens, Lebowski?

Person_5
Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You
got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,
man.

Person_8
Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is
Bunny.

Person_5
Bunny?  Look, moron.

Person_5
You see a wedding ring?  Does this
place look like I'm fucking married?
All my plants are dead!

Person_8
The fuck is this?

Person_5
Obviously you're not a golfer.

Person_8
Woo?

Person_9
Yeah?

Person_8
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a
millionaire?

Person_9
Uh?

Person_9
Fuck.

Person_8
What do you think?

Person_9
He looks like a fuckin' loser.

Person_5
Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

Person_9
Fuckin' waste of time.

Person_8
Thanks a lot, asshole.

Side_1
Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

Side_2
This was a valued rug.

Side_2
This was, uh--

Person_5
Yeah man, it really tied the room
together--

Side_2
This was a valued, uh.

Side_3
What tied the room together, Dude?

Side_2
Were you listening to the story,
Donny?

Side_3
What--

Side_2
Were you listening to the Dude's
story?

Side_3
I was bowling--

Side_2
So you have no frame of reference,
Donny.  You're like a child who
wanders in in the middle of a movie
and wants to know--

Person_5
What's your point, Walter?

Side_2
There's no fucking reason--here's my
point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

Side_3
Yeah Walter, what's your point?

Side_2
Huh?

Person_5
What's the point of--we all know who
was at fault, so what the fuck are
you talking about?

Side_2
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you
talking--I'm not--we're talking about
unchecked aggression here--

Side_3
What the fuck is he talking about?

Person_5
My rug.

Side_2
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of
your element.

Person_5
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
can't go give him a bill so what the
fuck are you talking about?

Side_2
What the fuck are you talking about?!
This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm
talking about drawing a line in the
sand, Dude.  Across this line you do
not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is
not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-
American.  Please.

Person_5
Walter, this is not a guy who built
the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
who peed on my--

Side_2
What the fuck are you--

Person_5
Walter, he peed on my rug--

Side_3
He peed on the Dude's rug--

Side_2
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This
Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

Person_5
So who--

Side_2
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other
Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.
He's gonna be easier to find anyway
than these two, uh. these two  . . .
And he has the wealth, uh, the
resources obviously, and there is no
reason, no FUCKING reason, why his
wife should go out and owe money and
they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

Person_5
No, but--

Side_2
Am I wrong!

Person_5
Yeah, but--

Side_2
Okay. That, uh.

Person_5
Fuckin' A.

Side_3
And this guy peed on it.

Side_2
Donny!  Please!

Person_5
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

Side_3
His name is Lebowski?  That's your
name, Dude!

Person_5
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should
compensate me for the fucking rug.
I mean his wife goes out and owes
money and they pee on my rug.

Side_2
Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on
your fucking Rug.

Side_4
And this is the study.  You can see
the various commendations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

Person_5
Yes, uh, very impressive.

Side_4
Please, feel free to inspect them.

Person_5
I'm not really, uh.

Side_4
Please!  Please!

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_4
That's the key to the city of
Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was
given two years ago in recognition
of his various civic, uh.

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_4
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce Business Achiever award,
which is given--not necessarily given
every year!  Given only when there's
a worthy, somebody especially--

Person_5
Hey, is this him with Nancy?

Side_4
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the
first lady, yes, taken when--

Person_5
Lebowski on the right?

Side_4
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,
Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

Person_5
He's handicapped, huh?

Side_4
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And
this picture was taken when Mrs.
Reagan was first lady of the nation,
yes, yes? Not of California.

Person_5
Far out.

Side_4
And in fact he met privately with
the President, though unfortunately
there wasn't time for a photo
opportunity.

Person_5
Nancy's pretty good.

Side_4
Wonderful woman.  We were very--

Person_5
Are these.

Side_4
These are Mr. Lebowski's children,
so to speak--

Person_5
Different mothers, huh?

Side_4
No, they--

Person_5
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially
pretty cool--

Side_4
They're not his, heh-heh, they're
not literally his children; they're
the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
inner-city children of promise but
without the--

Person_5
I see.

Side_4
--without  the means  for higher
education, so Mr. Lebowski  has
committed  to sending  all of them
to college.

Person_5
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one
more?

Side_4
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went
to college?

Person_5
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most
of my time occupying various, um,
administration buildings--

Side_4
Heh-heh--

Person_5
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into
the ROTC--

Side_4
Yes, heh--

Person_5
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the
truth, Brandt, I don't remember most
of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Side_5
Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a
Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very
busy so what can I do for you?

Person_5
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really
tied the room together-

Side_5
You told Brandt on the phone, he
told me.  So where do I fit in?

Person_5
Well they were looking for you, these
two guys, they were trying to--

Side_5
I'll say it again, all right?  You
told Brandt.  He told me.  I know
what happened. Yes?  Yes?

Person_5
So you know they were trying to piss
on your rug--

Side_5
Did I urinate on your rug?

Person_5
You mean, did you personally come
and pee on my--

Side_5
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla
usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

Person_5
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on
the rug--

Side_5
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I
just want to understand this, sir--
every time a rug is micturated upon
in this fair city, I have to
compensate the--

Person_5
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam
anybody here, I'm just--

Side_5
You're just looking for a handout
like every other--are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

Person_5
Look, let me explain something.
I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr.
Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's
what  you  call me.  That, or Duder.
His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,
you know, you're not into the whole
brevity thing--

Side_5
Are you employed, sir?

Person_5
Employed?

Side_5
You don't go out and make a living
dressed like that in the middle of a
weekday.

Person_5
Is this a--what day is this?

Side_5
But I do work, so if you don't mind--

Person_5
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.
This will not stand, ya know, this
will not stand, man.  I mean, if
your wife owes--

Side_5
My wife is not the issue here. I
hope that my wife will someday learn
to live on her allowance, which is
ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that
will be her problem, not mine, just
as your rug is your problem, just as
every bum's lot in life is his own
responsibility regardless of whom he
chooses to blame.  I didn't blame
anyone for the loss of my legs, some
chinaman in Korea took them from me
but I went out and achieved anyway.
I can't solve your problems, sir,
only you can.

Person_5
Ah fuck it.

Side_5
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!
Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your
answer to everything!

Side_5
Your "revolution" is over, Mr.
Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums
lost!

Side_5
...My advice is, do what your parents
did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will
always lose-- do you hear me,
Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

Side_6
--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt
is approaching.

Side_7
How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

Person_5
Okay.  The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

Side_7
Manolo will load it into your car
for you, uh, Dude.

Person_5
It's the LeBaron.

Side_7
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see
you again some time, Dude.

Person_5
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the
neighborhood, need to use the john.

Side_8
Blow on them.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_8
G'ahead.  Blow.

Person_5
You want me to blow on your toes?

Side_8
Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

Person_5
You sure he won't mind?

Side_8
Dieter doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

Person_5
Practicing?

Side_8
You're not blowing.

Side_7
Our guest has to be getting along,
Mrs.  Lebowski.

Person_5
You're Bunny?

Side_9
I'll suck your cock for a thousand
dollars.

Side_7
Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very
free-spirited.  We're all very fond
of her.

Side_9
Brandt can't watch though.  Or he
has to pay a hundred.

Side_7
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

Person_5
I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

Side_3
Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in
the water!!

Person_5
Your maples, Carl.

Side_2
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it
is no dream.

Person_5
You're fucking twenty minutes late.
What the fuck is that?

Side_2
Theodore Herzel.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_2
State of Israel.  If you will it,
Dude, it is no--

Person_5
What the fuck're you talking about?
The carrier.  What's in the fucking
carrier?

Side_2
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.
Can't leave him home alone or he
eats the furniture.

Person_5
What the fuck are you--

Side_2
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.
I'm looking after it while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

Person_5
You brought a fucking Pomeranian
bowling?

Side_2
What do you mean "brought it bowling"?
I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not
buying it a fucking beer.  He's not
gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

Person_5
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
me to take care of her fucking dog
while she and her boyfriend went to
Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck
herself.  Why can't she board it?

Side_2
First of all, Dude, you don't have
an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show
dog with fucking papers.  You can't
board it.  It gets upset, its hair
falls out.

Person_5
Hey man--

Side_2
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over
the line!

Side_2
Smokey Huh?

Side_2
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.
That's a foul.

Side_10
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

Side_2
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

Side_10
Bullshit. Walter!

Side_2
This is not Nam.  This is bowling.
There are rules.

Person_5
Come on Walter, it's just--it's
Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a
little, it's just a game.

Side_2
This is a league game.  This
determines who enters the next round-
robin, am I wrong?

Side_10
Yeah, but--

Side_2
Am I wrong!?

Side_10
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the
marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an
eight.

Side_2
Smokey my friend, you're entering a
world of pain.

Person_5
Hey Walter--

Side_2
Mark that frame an eight, you're
entering a world of pain.

Side_10
I'm not--

Side_2
A world of pain.

Side_10
Look Dude, I don't hold with this.
This guy is your partner, you should--

Person_5
Walter, they're calling the cops,
put the piece away.

Side_10
Walter--

Side_10
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking
zero!

Side_10
You happy, you crazy fuck?

Side_2
This is a league game, Smokey!

Person_5
Walter, you can't do that.  These
guys're like me, they're pacificists.
Smokey was a conscientious objector.

Side_2
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with
pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam,
of course--

Person_5
And you know Smokey has emotional
problems!

Side_2
You mean--beyond pacifism?

Person_5
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

Side_2
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well,
it's water under the bridge.  And we
do enter the next round-robin, am I
wrong?

Person_5
No, you're not wrong--

Side_2
Am I wrong!

Person_5
You're not wrong, Walter, you're
just an asshole.

Side_2
Okay then.  We play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.  They'll be
pushovers.

Person_5
Just, just take it easy, Walter.

Side_2
That's your answer to everything,
Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism
is not--look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq--
pacifism is not something to hide
behind.

Person_5
Well, just take 't easy, man.

Side_2
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

Person_5
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

Side_2
Calmer than you are.

Person_5
Just take it easy, man!

Side_2
Calmer than you are.

Person_6
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't
wanna be a hard-on about this, and I
know it wasn't your fault, but I
just thought it was fair to tell you
that Gene and I will be submitting
this to the League and asking them
to set aside the round.  Or maybe
forfeit it to us--

Person_5
Shit!

Person_6
--so, like I say, just thought, you
know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

Side_11
Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,
well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.
Please call us as soon as is
convenient.

Side_11
Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski
with the Southern Cal Bowling League.
I just got a, an informal report,
uh, that a uh, a member of your team,
uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded
weapon during league play--

Person_5
Hiya Allan.

Side_12
Dude, I finally got the venue I
wanted.  I'm Performing my dance
quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane
Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on
Tuesday night, and I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

Person_5
Sure Allan, I'll be there.

Side_12
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the
tenth.

Person_5
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

Side_12
Just, uh, just slip the rent under
my door.

Person_5
Yeah, okay.

Person_6
--serious infraction, and examine
your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

Person_6
Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please
do call us when you get in and I'll
send the limo.  Let me assure you--I
hope you're not avoiding this call
because of the rug, which, I assure
you, is not a problem.  We need your
help and, uh--well we would very
much like to see you.  Thank you.
It's Brandt.

Side_7
We've had some terrible news.  Mr.
Lebowski is in seclusion in the West
Wing.

Person_5
Huh.

Side_7
Mr. Lebowski.

Side_5
It's funny.  I can look back on a
life of achievement, on challenges
met, competitors bested, obstacles
overcome.  I've accomplished more
than most men, and without the use
of my legs.  What. . . What makes a
man, Mr. Lebowski?

Person_5
Dude.

Side_5
Huh?

Person_5
I don't know, sir.

Side_5
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to
do the right thing?  Whatever the
price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

Person_5
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Side_5
You're joking.  But perhaps you're
right.

Person_5
Mind if I smoke a jay?

Side_5
Bunny.

Person_5
'Scuse me?

Side_5
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light
of my life.  Are you surprised at my
tears, sir?

Person_5
Fuckin' A.

Side_5
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men
also cry.

Side_5
I received this fax this morning.

Side_5
As you can see, it is a ransom note.
Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable
to achieve on a level field of play.
Men who will not sign their names.
Weaklings.  Bums.

Person_5
Bummer.

Side_5
Brandt will fill you in on the
details.

Side_7
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as
courier once we get instructions for
the money.

Person_5
Why me, man?

Side_7
He suspects that the culprits might
be the very people who, uh, soiled
your rug, and you're in a unique
position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm
that suspicion.

Person_5
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,
huh?

Side_7
Well Dude, we just don't know.

Person_5
Fucking Quintana--that creep can
roll, man--

Side_2
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,
Dude.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_2
The man is a sex offender.  With a
record.  Spent six months in Chino
for exposing himself to an eight-
year-old.

Person_5
Huh.

Side_2
When he moved down to Venice he had
to go door-to-door to tell everyone
he's a pederast.

Side_3
What's a pederast, Walter?

Side_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

Side_2
Anyway.  How much they offer you?

Person_5
Twenty grand.  And of course I still
keep the rug.

Side_2
Just for making the hand-off?

Person_5
Yeah.

Person_5
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so
whenever these guys call--

Side_2
What if it's during a game?

Person_5
I told him if it was during league
play--

Side_3
If what's during league play?

Side_2
Life does not stop and start at your
convenience, you miserable piece of
shit.

Side_3
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

Person_5
I figure it's easy money, it's all
pretty harmless.  I mean she probably
kidnapped herself.

Side_2
Huh?

Side_3
What do you mean, Dude?

Person_5
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean
look at it.  Young trophy wife.
Marries a guy for money but figures
he isn't giving her enough.  She
owes money all over town--

Side_2
That...fucking...bitch!

Person_5
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin
said, look for the person who will
benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,
you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
to say--

Side_3
I am the Walrus.

Side_2
That fucking bitch!

Person_5
Yeah.

Side_3
I am the Walrus.

Side_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

Side_3
What the fuck is he talking about?

Side_2
That's fucking exactly what happened,
Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

Person_5
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

Side_3
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed
off?

Side_2
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking
thing-- I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck so that
this fucking strumpet--

Person_5
I don't see any connection to Vietnam,
Walter.

Side_2
Well, there isn't a literal
connection, Dude.

Person_5
Walter, face it, there isn't any
connection.  It's your roll.

Side_2
Have it your way.  The point is--

Person_5
It's your roll--

Side_2
The fucking point is--

Person_5
It's your roll.

Person_6
Are you ready to be fucked, man?

Side_13
I see you rolled your way into the
semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and
me, we're gonna fuck you up.

Person_5
Yeah well, that's just, ya know,
like, your opinion, man.

Side_13
Let me tell you something, bendeco.
You pull any your crazy shit with
us, you flash a piece out on the
lanes, I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass and pull
the fucking trigger til it goes
"click".

Person_5
Jesus.

Side_13
You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with
the Jesus.

Side_2
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

Person_5
Oh man.

Side_7
They called about eighty minutes
ago.  They want you to take the money
and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll
call you on the portable phone with
instructions in about forty minutes.
One person only or I'd go with you.
They were very clear on that: one
person only.  What happened to your
jaw?

Person_5
Oh, nothin', you know.

Side_7
Here's the money, and the phone.
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_7
Her life is in your hands.

Person_5
Oh, man, don't say that..

Side_7
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:
Her life is in your hands.

Person_5
Shit.

Side_7
Her life is in your hands, Dude.
And report back to us as soon as
it's done.

Side_2
Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

Person_5
The what?

Side_2
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have
they called yet?

Person_5
What the hell is this?

Side_2
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.
The whites.

Person_5
Agh--

Person_5
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies--

Side_2
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.
The ringer can't look empty.

Person_5
Walter--what the fuck are you
thinking?

Side_2
Well you're right, Dude, I got to
thinking.  I got to thinking why
should we settle for a measly fucking
twenty grand--

Person_5
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you
just wanted to come along--

Side_2
My point, Dude, is why should we
settle for twenty grand when we can
keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

Person_5
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a
fucking game, Walter--

Side_2
It is a fucking game.  You said so
yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

Person_5 '
Yeah, but--

Person_5
Dude here.

Person_6
Who is this?

Person_5
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want
us to go?

Person_6
...Us?

Person_6
Shut the fuck up.
Hello?

Person_5
Yeah?

Person_6
Okay, listen--

Side_2
Dude, are you fucking this up?

Person_6
Who is that?

Person_5
The driver man, I told you--

Person_5
Oh shit.  Walter.

Side_2
What the fuck is going on there?

Person_5
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it
up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was
in our hands!

Side_2
Easy, Dude.

Person_5
We're screwed now!  We don't get
shit and they're gonna kill her!
We're fucked, Walter!

Side_2
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.
You're being very unDude.  They'll
call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

Side_2
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here,
Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These
guys are fucking amateurs--

Person_5
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say
peep when I'm doing business here.

Side_2
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

Side_2
But they're amateurs.

Person_5
Dude here.

Person_6
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there
is no funny stuff.

Person_5
Yeah.

Person_6
So no funny stuff.  Okay?

Person_5
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you
want us to go.

Person_5
That was the sign.

Side_2
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back,
nobody's in a position to complain.
And we keep the baksheesh.

Person_5
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't
told me how we get her back.  Where
is she?

Side_2
That's the simple part, Dude.  When
we make the handoff, I grab the guy
and beat  it out of him.

Side_2
...Huh?

Person_5
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.
That's fucking ingenious, if I
understand it correctly.  That's a
Swiss fucking watch.

Side_2
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of
this is its simplicity. If the plan
gets too complex something always
goes wrong.  If there's one thing I
learned in Nam--

Person_5
Dude.

Person_6
You are approaching a vooden britch.
When you cross it you srow ze bag
from ze left vindow of ze moving
kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch
you.

Side_2
What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
off?

Person_5
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!
At a wooden bridge we throw the money
out  of the car!

Side_2
Huh?

Person_5
We throw the money out of the moving
car!

Side_2
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks
up our plan.

Person_5
Well call them up and explain it to
'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking
simple, I'm sure they'd fucking
understand it!  That's the beauty of
it Walter!

Side_2
Wooden bridge, huh?

Person_5
I'm throwing the money, Walter!
We're not fucking around!

Side_2
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the
ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

Person_5
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but
sooner or later you're gonna have to
face the fact that you're a goddamn
moron.

Side_2
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's
the bridge--

Person_5
Walter!

Side_2
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

Person_5
What the fuck?

Side_2
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch
I roll out!  I double back, grab one
of 'em and beat it out of him!  The
uzi!

Person_5
Uzi?

Side_2
You didn't think I was rolling out
of here naked!

Person_5
Walter, please--

Side_2
Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's
take that hill!

Person_5
WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

Side_2
Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

Side_2
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used
to say.

Person_5
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean?  What the fuck're we gonna
tell Lebowski?

Side_2
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't
see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

Person_5
Huh?  The problem is--what do you
mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
they're gonna kill that poor woman--

Side_2
What the fuck're you talking about?
That poor woman--that poor slut--
kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said
so yourself--

Person_5
No, Walter!  I said I thought she
kidnapped herself!  You're the one
who's so fucking certain--

Side_2
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

Side_3
They posted the next round of the
tournament--

Side_2
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

Side_3
This Saturday.  Quintana and--

Side_2
Saturday!  Well they'll have to
reschedule.

Person_5
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

Side_2
I told that fuck down at the league
office-- who's in charge of
scheduling?

Person_5
Walter--

Side_3
Burkhalter.

Side_2
I told that kraut a fucking thousand
times I don't roll on shabbas.

Side_3
It's already posted.

Person_5
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about
that poor woman?  What do we tell--

Side_2
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get
sick of her little game and, you
know, wander back--

Side_3
How come you don't roll on Saturday,
Walter?

Side_2
I'm shomer shabbas.

Side_3
What's that, Walter?

Person_5
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I
tell Lebowski?

Side_2
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of
rest.  Means I don't work, I don't
drive a car, I don't fucking ride in
a car, I don't handle money, I don't
turn on the oven, and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

Side_3
Sheesh.

Person_5
Walter, how--

Side_2
Shomer shabbas.

Person_5
That's it.  I'm out of here.

Side_2
For Christ's sake, Dude.

Side_3
Oh yeah, how'd it go?

Side_2
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little
dinged up--

Person_5
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking
hand- off!  They didn't get, the
fucking money and they're gonna--
they're gonna--

Side_2
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

Side_2
Kill that poor woman.

Side_3
Walter, if you can't ride in a car,
how d'you get around on Shammas--

Side_2
Really, Dude, you surprise me.
They're not gonna kill shit.  They're
not gonna do shit.  What can they
do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.  Who's
sitting on a million fucking dollars?
Am I wrong?

Person_5
Walter--

Side_2
Who's got a fucking million fucking
dollars parked in the trunk of our
car out here?

Person_5
"Our" car, Walter?

Side_2
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty
undies.  My fucking whites--Say,
where is  the car?

Side_3
Who has your undies, Walter?

Side_2
Where's your car, Dude?

Person_5
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to
know the answer to everything else!

Side_2
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped
spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

Person_5
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking
know it's been stolen!

Side_2
Well, certainly that's a possibility,
Dude--

Person_5
Aw, fuck it.

Side_3
Where you going, Dude?

Person_5
I'm going home, Donny.

Side_3
Your phone's ringing, Dude.

Person_5
Thank you, Donny.

Person_5
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

Side_15
Color?

Person_5
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,
coloration.

Side_15
And was there anything of value in
the car?

Person_5
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple
of Creedence tapes.  And there was
a, uh. . . my briefcase.

Side_15
In the briefcase?

Person_5
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my
papers.  Business papers.

Side_15
And what do you do, sir?

Person_5
I'm unemployed.

Side_16
...Most people, we're working nights,
they offer us coffee.

Person_5
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But
it's nice when they offer.

Person_5
...Also, my rug was stolen.

Side_15
Your rug was in the car.

Person_5
No.  Here.

Side_15
Separate incidents?

Side_16
Snap out of it, son.

Person_5
You find them much?  Stolen cars?

Side_15
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much
hope for the tape deck though.  Or
the Creedence tapes.

Person_5
And the, uh, the briefcase?

Side_17
Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.
Call when you get home and I'll send
a car for you.  My name is Maude
Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took
the rug.

Side_16
Well, I guess we can close the file
on that one.

Person_6
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.
Lebowski.

Person_5
Is that what that's a picture of?

Side_18
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.
My art has been commended as being
strongly vaginal.  Which bothers
some men.  The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

Person_5
Oh yeah?

Side_18
Yes, they don't like hearing it and
find it difficult to say.  Whereas
without batting an eye a man will
refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or
his "Johnson".

Person_5
"Johnson"?

Side_18
Thank you.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_18
Yes, I know about it.  And I know
that you acted as courier.  And let
me tell you something:  the whole
thing stinks to high heaven.

Person_5
Right, but let me explain something
about that rug--

Side_18
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

Person_5
Excuse me?

Side_18
Sex.  The physical act of love.
Coitus.  Do you like it?

Person_5
I was talking about my rug.

Side_18
You're not interested in sex?

Person_5
You mean coitus?

Side_18
I like it too.  It's a male myth
about feminists that we hate sex.
It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.
But unfortunately there are some
people--it is called satyriasis in
men, nymphomania in women--who engage
in it compulsively and without joy.

Person_5
Oh, no.

Side_18
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate
souls cannot love in the true sense
of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these.

Person_5
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho, but I don't
see what it has to do with--do you
have any kalhua?

Side_18
Take a look at this, sir.

Side_19
Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere
iss problem mit deine kable.

Person_5
Shit, I know that guy.  He's a
nihilist.

Side_18
And you recognize her, of course.

Side_19
Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Side_18
The story is ludicrous.

Side_19
Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to
verk in zese clozes--

Side_18
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes
from here.

Person_5
He fixes the cable?

Side_18
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little
matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career

Person_5
Shit yeah, the achievers.

Side_18
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
yes, and proud we are of all of them.
I asked my father about his withdrawal
of a million dollars from the
Foundation account and he told me
about this "abduction", but I tell
you it is preposterous.  This
compulsive

Person_5
Yeah, but my-

Side_18
I'm getting to your rug. My  father
and I don't get along; he doesn't
approve of my lifestyle and, needless
to say, I don't approve of his.
Still, I hardly wish to make my
father's embezzlement a police matter,
so I'm proposing that you try to
recover the money from the people
you delivered it to.

Person_5
Well--sure, I could do that--

Side_18
If you successfully do so, I will
compensate you to the tune of 1% of
the recovered sum.

Person_5
A hundred.

Side_18
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

Person_5
Yeah, but what about--

Side_18
--your rug, yes, well with that money
you can buy any number of rugs that
don't have sentimental value for me.
And I am sorry about that crack on
the jaw.

Person_5
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

Side_18
Here's the name and number of a doctor
who will look at it for you.  You
will receive no bill.  He's a good
man, and thorough.

Person_5
That's really thoughtful but I--

Side_18
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a
good man, and thorough.

Side_20
--So he says, "My son can't hold a
job, my daughter's married to a
fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on
my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.
But you know me.  I can't complain."

Person_5
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.
Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya
Tony.

Side_21
Aw, forget about it.

Person_5
Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be
worrying about that shit.  Life goes
on!

Side_21
Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your
friend in the Volkswagon?

Person_5
Huh?

Person_5
When did he-

Side_22
Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No
arguments.

Person_5
Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

Side_5
Start talking and talk fast you lousy
bum!

Side_7
We've been frantically trying to
reach you, Dude.

Side_5
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

Person_5
Well we--I don't--

Side_5
They did not receive the money, you
nitwit!  They  did not receive the
goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR

Side_7
This is our concern, Dude.

Person_5
No, man, nothing is fucked here--

Person_5
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?
Those guys are--we dropped off the
damn money--

Person_5
I--the royal we, you know, the
editorial--I dropped off the money,
exactly as per--Look, I've got certain
information, certain things have
come to light, and uh, has it ever
occurred to you, man, that given the
nature of all this new shit, that,
uh, instead of running around blaming
me, that this whole thing might just
be, not, you know, not just such a
simple, but uh--you know?

Side_5
What in God's holy name are you
blathering about?

Person_5
I'll tell you what I'm blathering
about!  I got information--new shit
has come to light and--shit, man!
She kidnapped herself!

Person_5
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy
wife, I mean, in the parlance of our
times, owes money all over town,
including to known pornographers--
and that's cool, that's cool-- but
I'm saying, she needs money, and of
course they're gonna say they didn't
get it 'cause she wants more, man,
she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
Sir?

Side_5
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not
occurred to me.

Side_7
That had not occurred to us, Dude.

Person_5
Well, okay, you're not privy to all
the new shit, so uh, you know, but
that's what you pay me for.  Speaking
of which, would it be possible for
me to get my twenty grand in cash?
I gotta check this with my accountant
of course, but my concern is that,
you know, it could bump me into a
higher tax--

Side_5
Brandt, give him the envelope.

Person_5
Well, okay, if you've already made
out the check.  Brandt is handing
him a letter-sized envelope which is
distended by something inside.

Side_7
We received it this morning.

Side_5
Since you have failed to achieve,
even in the modest task that was
your charge, since you have stolen
my money, and since you have
unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

Side_5
I have no choice but to tell these
bums that they should do whatever is
necessary to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And
with Brandt as my witness, tell you
this:  Any further harm visited upon
Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon
your head.

Side_5
...By God sir.  I will not abide
another toe.

Side_2
That wasn't her toe.

Person_5
Whose toe was it, Walter?

Side_2
How the fuck should I know?  I do
know that nothing about it indicates--

Person_5
The nail polish, Walter.

Side_2
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible
to get some nail polish, apply it to
someone else's toe--

Person_5
Someone else's--where the fuck are
they gonna--

Side_2
You want a toe?  I can get you a
toe, believe me.  There are ways,
Dude.  You don't wanna know about
it, believe me.

Person_5
But Walter--

Side_2
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this
afternoon--with nail  polish. These
fucking amateurs.   They send us a
toe, we're  supposed to  shit our-
selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My
point is--

Person_5
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and
then they're gonna kill me--

Side_2
Well that's just, that's the stress
talking, Dude.  So far we have what
looks to me like a series of
victimless crimes--

Person_5
What about the toe?

Side_23
Could you please keep your voices
down--this is a family restaurant.

Side_2
Oh, please dear!  I've got news for
you: the Supreme Court has roundly
rejected prior restraint!

Person_5
Walter, this isn't a First Amendment
thing.

Side_23
Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

Side_2
Lady, I got buddies who died face-
down in the muck so you and I could
enjoy this family restaurant!

Person_5
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry
ma'am.

Side_2
Don't run away from this, Dude!
Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

Side_2
Our basic freedoms!

Side_2
I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

Side_2
Finishing my coffee.

Person_6 THROUGH MACHINE
Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer
Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

Person_6 THROUGH MACHINE
We've recovered your vehicle.  It
can be claimed at the North Hollywood
Auto Circus there on Victory.

Person_5
Far out.  Far fuckin' out.

Side_25
You'll just need to present a--

Person_5
Hunh?

Person_5
Hey!  This is a private residence,
man!

Person_5
Nice marmot.

Side_26
Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

Side_27
You think veer kidding und making
mit de funny stuff?

Side_28
Vee could do things you only dreamed
of, Lebowski.

Side_27
Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.
Vee belief in nossing.

Side_19
Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!

Person_5
Jesus Christ!

Side_26
Tomorrow vee come back und cut off

Excuse me?

Side_27
Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

Side_26
Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

Side_27
Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und
skvush it, Lebowski!

Side_29
You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.
Lebowski. Must've been a joyride
situation; they abandoned the car
once they hit the retaining wall.

Side_29
These were on the road next to the
car.  You'll have to get in on the
other side.

Person_5
My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

Side_29
Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.
You're lucky they left the tape deck
though.

Person_5
My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's
that smell?

Side_29
Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept
in the car.  Or perhaps just used it
as a toilet, and moved on.

Person_5
When will you find these guys?  I
mean, do you have any promising leads?

Side_29
Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with
the boys down at the Crime Lab.
They've assigned four more detectives
to the case, got us working in shifts.

Side_3
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

Side_2
Oh for Christ--will you shut the
fuck up, Donny.

Person_5
I figure my only hope is that the
big Lebowski kills me before the
Germans can cut my dick off.

Side_2
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No
one is going to cut your dick off.

Person_5
Thanks Walter.

Side_2
Not if I have anything to say about
it.

Person_5
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me
a very secure feeling.

Side_2
Dude--

Person_5
That makes me feel all warm inside.

Side_2
Now Dude--

Person_5
This whole fucking thing--I  could
be sitting here with just pee-stains
on my rug.

Side_2
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.
Fucking Nazis.

Side_3
They were Nazis, Dude?

Side_2
Come on, Donny, they were threatening
castration!

Side_3
Uh-huh.

Side_2
Are you gonna split hairs?

Side_3
No--

Side_2
Am I wrong?

Side_3
Well--

Person_5
They're nihilists.

Side_2
Huh?

Person_5
They kept saying they believe in
nothing.

Side_2
Nihilists!  Jesus.

Person_5
Yeah.

Side_2
And let's also not forget--let's not
forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent, for uh,
domestic, you know, within the city--
that isn't legal either.

Person_5
What're you, a fucking park ranger
now?

Side_2
No, I'm--

Person_5
Who gives a shit about the fucking
marmot!

Side_2
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

Person_5
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need
your sympathy, man, I need my fucking
Johnson!

Side_3
What do you need that for, Dude?

Side_2
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go
into the tournament with this negative
attitude--

Person_5
Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,
Walter!

Side_2
Fuck the tournament?!

Side_2
Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want
to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's
go get a lane.

Person_5
Another Caucasian, Gary.

Person_6
Right, Dude.

Person_5
Friends like these, huh Gary.

Side_30
That's right, Dude.

Side_1
D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?

Side_31
Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

Side_32
That's a good one.

Side_32
How ya doin' there, Dude?

Person_5
Ahh, not so good, man.

Side_32
One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser
fella than m'self once said, sometimes
you eat the bar and sometimes the
bar, wal, he eats you.

Person_5
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern
thing?

Side_32
Far from it.

Person_5
Mm.

Side_32
Much obliged.

Side_32
I like your style, Dude.

Person_5
Well I like your style too, man.
Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

Side_32
Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.
D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

Person_5
The fuck are you talking about?

Side_32
Okay, have it your way.

Side_32
Take it easy, Dude.

Person_5
Yeah.  Thanks man.

Person_6
Dude!  Dude!

Side_18
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the
doctor.

Person_5
No it's fine, really, uh--

Side_18
Do you have any news regarding my
father's money?

Person_5
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta
respecfully, 69 you know, tender my
resignation on that matter, 'cause
it looks like your mother really was
kidnapped after all.

Side_18
She most certainly was not!

Person_5
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen
occasionally?  You might learn
something.  Now I got--

Side_18
And please don't call her my mother.

Person_5
Now I got--

Side_18
She is most definitely the perpetrator
and not the victim.

Person_5
I'm telling you, I got definitive
evidence--

Side_18
From who?

Person_5
The main guy, Dieter--

Side_18
Dieter Hauff?

Person_5
Well--yeah, I guess--

Side_18
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

Person_5
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,
you know him?

Side_18
Dieter has been on the fringes of--
well, of everything in L.A., for
about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.
Under 'Autobahn.'

Side_18
That was his group--they released
one album in the mid-seventies.

Person_5
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

Side_18
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their
music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

Person_5
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

Side_18
Is he pretending to be the abductor?

Person_5
Well...yeah--

Side_18
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really
kidnap someone that you're acquainted
with.  You can't get away with it if
the hostage knows who you are.

Person_5
Well yeah...I know that.

Side_18
So Dieter has the money?

Person_5
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a
complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.
Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to
keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands
in old Duder's--

Side_18
Do you still have that doctor's
number?

Person_5
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have
the bruise any more, I--

Side_18
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be
responsible for any delayed after-
effects.

Person_5
Delayed after-eff--

Side_18
I want you to see him immediately.

Side_18
I'll see if he's available.  He's a
good man, and thorough.

Person_6
Could you slide your shorts down
please, Mr.  Lebowski?

Person_5
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

Person_6
I understand sir.  Could you slide
your shorts down please?

Person_5
Fuck Me.

Person_5
Fuckola, man.

Side_2
He lives in North Hollywood on
Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

Person_5
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

Side_2
Near the In-and-Out Burger--

Side_3
Those are good burgers, Walter.

Side_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid
is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his
father is--are you ready for this?--
Arthur Digby Sellers.

Person_5
Who the fuck is that?

Side_2
Huh?

Person_5
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

Side_2
Who the f--have you ever heard of a
little show called Branded, Dude?

Person_5
Yeah.

Side_2
All but one man died?  There at Bitter
Creek?

Person_5
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show
Walter, so what?

Side_2
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote
156 episodes, Dude.

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_2
The bulk of the series.

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_2
Not exactly a lightweight.

Person_5
No.

Side_2
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

Person_5
Uh.

Side_2
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out
there after the, uh, the.

Side_2
What have you.  We'll, uh--

Side_3
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

Side_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh,
brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.
We'll get that fucking money, if he
hasn't spent it already.  Million
fucking clams. And yes, we'll be
near the, uh--some burgers, some
beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking
troubles are over, Dude.

Person_5
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already
spent all the money!

Side_2
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's
still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,
depending on the options.  Wait in
the car, Donny.

Side_33
Jace?

Side_2
Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter
Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this
is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

Side_33
Jace.

Side_2
May we uh, we wanted to talk about
little Larry.  May we come in?

Side_33
Jace.

Side_34
Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

Side_2
That's him, Dude.

Side_35
And a good day to you, sir.

Side_34
See down, please.

Side_2
Thank you, ma'am.

Side_2
Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

Side_34
No, no.  He has healt' problems.

Side_2
Uh-huh.

Side_2
I just want to say, sir, that we're
both enormous--on a personal level,
Branded, especially the early
episodes, has been a source of, uh,
inspir---

Side_34
See down, Sweetie.  These are the
policeman--

Side_2
No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the
impression that we're police exactly.
We're hoping that it will not be
necessary to call the police.

Side_2
But that is up to little Larry here.
Isn't it, Larry?

Side_2
Is this your homework, Larry?

Side_2
Is this your homework, Larry?

Person_5
Look, man, did you--

Side_2
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your
homework, Larry?

Person_5
Just ask him if he--ask him about
the car, man!

Side_2
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your
homework, Larry?

Person_5
Is the car out front yours?

Side_2
Is this your homework, Larry?

Person_5
We know it's his fucking homework,
Walter!  Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

Side_2
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

Person_5
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

Side_2
You're going to enter a world of
pain, son.  We know that this is
your homework.  We know you stole a
car--

Person_5
And the fucking money!

Side_2
And the fucking money.  And we know
that this is your homework, Larry.

Side_2
You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

Side_2
Ah, this is pointless.

Side_2
All right, Plan B.  You might want
to watch out the front window there,
Larry.

Side_2
This is what happens when you FUCK a
STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

Side_2
Fucking language problem, Dude.

Side_2
Maybe he'll understand this.

Side_2
Hunh?

Person_5
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

Person_5
I accept your apology. . . No I, I
just want to handle it myself from
now on. . . No.  That has nothing to
do with it. . . .Yes, it made it
home, I'm calling from home.  No,
Walter, it didn't look like Larry
was about to crack.

Person_5
Well that's your perception. . .
Well you're right, Walter, and the
unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND
LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,
I'll be at practice.

Person_5
Huh?

Person_9
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.

Person_8
And we know which Lebowski you are,
Lebowski.

Person_9
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk
to the deadbeat Lebowski.

Person_8
You're not dealing with morons here.

Side_1
Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm
Jackie Treehorn.

Person_5
This is quite a pad you got here,
man.  Completely unspoiled.

Side_36
What's your drink, Dude?

Person_5
White Russian, thanks.  How's the
smut business, Jackie?

Side_36
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in
publishing, entertainment, political
advocacy, and--

Person_5
Which one was Logjammin'?

Side_36
Regrettably, it's true, standards
have fallen in adult entertainment.
It's video, Dude.  Now that we're
competing with the amateurs, we can't
afford to invest that little extra
in story, production value, feeling.

Side_36
People forget that the brain is the
biggest erogenous zone--

Person_5
On you, maybe.

Side_36
Of course, you do get the good with
the bad.  The new technology permits
us to do exciting things with
interactive erotic software.  Wave
of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

Person_5
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off
manually.

Side_36
Of course you do.  I can see you're
anxious for me to get to the point.
Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

Person_5
I thought you might know, man.

Side_36
Me?  How would I know?  The only
reason she ran off was to get away
from her rather sizable debt to me.

Person_5
But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Side_36
I've heard the kidnapping story, so
save it.  I know you're mixed up in
all this, Dude, and I don't care
what you're trying to take off her
husband.  That's your business.  All
I'm saying is, I want mine.

Person_5
Yeah, well, right man, there are
many facets to this, uh, you know,
many interested parties.  If I can
find your money, man-- what's in it
for the Dude?

Side_36
Of course, there's that to discuss.
Refill?

Person_5
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

Side_36
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

Person_5
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way
you do business.  Your money is being
held by a kid named Larry Sellers.
He lives in North Hollywood, on
Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.
A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure
your goons'll be able to get it off
him, mean he's only fifteen and he's
flunking social studies.  So if you'll
just write me a check for my ten per
cent. . . of half a million. . .
fifty grand.

Person_5
I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you
mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

Side_36
A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your
idea of a joke?

Person_5
No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's
got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just
wanted a car.  All the Dude ever
wanted. . . was his rug back. . .
not greedy. . . it really.

Side_32'S VOICE
Darkness warshed over the Dude--
darker'n a black steer's tookus on a
moonless prairie night.  There was
no bottom.

Person_5
He was innocent.  Not a charge was
true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

Side_38
This is your only I.D.?

Person_5
I know my rights.

Side_38
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

Person_5
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I
want Bill Kunstler.

Side_38
What are you, some kind of sad-assed
refugee from the fucking sixties?

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_38
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to
eject you from his garden party,
that you were drunk and abusive.

Person_5
That guy treats women like objects,
man.

Side_38
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in
this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw
shit.  We got a nice quiet beach
community here, and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.  So let me make
something plain.  I don't like you
sucking around bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
off name, I don't like your jerk-off
face, I don't like your jerk- off
behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
off --do I make myself clear?

Person_5
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

Person_5
--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

Side_38
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

Side_38
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep
your ugly fucking goldbricking ass
out of my beach community!

Person_5
Jesus, man, can you change the
station?

Side_20
Fuck you man!  You don't like my
fucking music, get your own fucking
cab!

Person_5
I've had a--

Side_20
I pull over and kick your ass out,
man!

Person_5
--had a rough night, and I hate the
fucking Eagles, man--

Side_20
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

Person_5
Jesus.

Side_18
Jeffrey.

Person_5
Maude?

Side_18
Love me.

Person_5
That's my robe.

Side_18
Tell me a little about yourself,
Jeffrey.

Person_5
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

Person_5
I was, uh, one of the authors of the
Port Huron Statement.--The original
Port Huron Statement.

Side_18
Uh-huh.

Person_5
Not the compromised second draft.
And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the
Seattle Seven?

Side_18
Mmnun.

Person_5
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music
business briefly.

Side_18
Oh?

Person_5
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed
of Sound Tour.

Side_18
Uh-huh.

Person_5
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you
know, little of this, little of that.
My career's, uh, slowed down a bit
lately.

Side_18
What do you do for fun?

Person_5
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.
Drive around.  The occasional acid
flashback.

Side_18
What happened to your house?

Person_5
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.
Wanted to save the finder's fee.

Side_18
Finder's fee?

Person_5
He thought I had your father's money,
so he got me out of the way while he
looked for it.

Side_18
It's not my father's money, it's the
Foundation's.  Why did he think you
had it?  And who does?

Person_5
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.
Real fucking brat.

Side_18
Jeffrey--

Person_5
It's a complicated case, Maude.
Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately
I've been adhering to a pretty strict,
uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,
you know, limber.  I'm real fucking
close to your father's money, real
fucking close.  It's just--

Side_18
I keep telling you, it's the
Foundation's money.  Father doesn't
have any.

Person_5
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

Side_18
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

Person_5
But your father--he runs stuff, he--

Side_18
We did let Father run one of the
companies, briefly, but he didn't do
very well at it.

Person_5
But he's--

Side_18
He helps administer the charities
now, and I give him a reasonable
allowance.  He has no money of his
own.  I know how he likes to present
himself; Father's weakness is vanity.
Hence the slut.

Person_5
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is
that yoga?

Side_18
It increases the chances of
conception.

Person_5
Increases?

Side_18
Well yes, what did you think this
was all about?  Fun and games?

Person_5
Well...no, of course not--

Side_18
I want a child.

Person_5
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

Side_18
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.
In fact I don't want the father to
be someone I have to see socially,
or who'll have any interest in rearing
the child himself.

Person_5
Huh...

Person_5
So...that doctor.

Side_18
Exactly.  What happened to your face?
Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

Person_5
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.
A real reactionary. . . So your
father. . . Oh man, I get it!

Side_18
What?

Person_5
Yeah, my thinking about the case,
man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.
Your father--

Side_39
This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in;
leave a message after the beep.

Side_18'S VOICE
What're you talking about?

Person_5
Walter, if you're there, pick up the
fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,
this is an emergency.  I'm not--

Side_2
Dude?

Person_5
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I
need you to come pick me up--

Side_2
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev
shabbas.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_2
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm
not even supposed to pick up the
phone, unless it's an emergency.

Person_5
It is a fucking emergency.

Side_2
I understand.  That's why I picked
up the phone.

Person_5
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,
just call Donny then, and ask him to--

Side_2
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

Side_18'S VOICE
Jeffrey?

Person_5
Get out of that fucking car, man!

Person_5
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,
man!

Side_1
Relax, man!  No physical harm
intended!

Person_5
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you
been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

Side_1
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

Person_5
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

Side_1
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking
about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a
private snoop!  Like you, man!

Person_5
Huh?

Side_41
A dick, man!  And let me tell you
something: I dig your work. Playing
one side against the other--in bed
with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

Person_5
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay
away from my fucking lady friend,
man.

Side_41
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your
special lady--

Person_5
She's not my special lady, she's my
fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping
her conceive, man!

Side_41
Hey, man, I'm not--

Person_5
Who're you working for?  Lebowski?
Jackie Treehorn?

Side_41
The Gundersons.

Person_5
The?  Who the fff--

Side_41
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering
daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.
Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.
Her parents want her back.

Side_41
See?

Person_5
Jesus fucking Christ.

Side_41
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

Person_5
Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on
the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

Side_41
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

Person_5
Yeah, it sucks.

Side_41
Well maybe you and me could pool our
resources--trade information--
professional courtesy--compeers, you
know--

Person_5
Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.
And stay away from my special la--
from my fucking lady friend.

Side_23
You folks ready?

Side_19
I haff lingenberry pancakes.

Side_42
Lingenberry pancakes.

Side_43
Sree picks in blanket.

Side_19
Lingenberry pancakes.

Person_5
I mean we totally fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his pay-off.  And got
the kidnappers all pissed off, and
the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,
but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

Side_2
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic,
uh.

Person_5
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
up, then why does he still leave me
in charge of getting back his wife?
Because he fucking doesn't want her
back, man!  He's had enough!  He no
longer digs her!  It's all a show!
But then, why didn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?  I mean, he
knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,
but he never asked for it back.

Side_2
What's your point, Dude?

Person_5
His million bucks was never in it,
man!  There was no money in that
briefcase!  He was hoping they'd
kill her!  You throw out a ringer
for a ringer!

Side_2
Yeah?

Person_5
Shit yeah!

Side_2
Okay, but how does all this add up
to an emergency?

Person_5
Huh?

Side_2
I'm saying, I see what you're getting
at, Dude, he kept the money, but my
point is, here we are, it's shabbas,
the sabbath, which I'm allowed to
break only if it's a matter of life
and death--

Person_5
Walter, come off it.  You're not
even fucking Jewish, you're--

Side_2
What the fuck are you talking about?

Person_5
You're fucking Polish Catholic--

Side_2
What the fuck are you talking about?
I converted when I married Cynthia!
Come on, Dude!

Person_5
Yeah, and you were--

Side_2
You know this!

Person_5
And you were divorced five fucking
years ago.

Side_2
Yeah?  What do you think happens
when you get divorced?  You turn in
your library card?  Get a new driver's
license?  Stop being Jewish?

Person_5
This driveway.

Side_2
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

Person_5
It's just part of your whole sick
Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her
fucking dog.  Going to her fucking
synagogue.  You're living in the
fucking past.

Side_2
Side_44
Three thousand years of beautiful
tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell
happened?

Side_2
Jesus Christ.

Side_7
He can't see you, Dude.

Person_5
Where'd she been?

Side_7
Visiting friends of hers in Palm
Springs.  Just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

Person_5
But I guess she told Dieter.

Side_2
Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped
her.

Side_7
Who's this gentleman, Dude?

Side_2
Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

Side_7
You shouldn't go in there, Dude!
He's very angry!

Side_5
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

Person_5
Where's the money, Lebowski?

Side_5
Who the hell is he?

Side_2
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy
who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY

Person_5
We know the briefcase was empty,
man.  We know you kept the million
bucks yourself.

Side_5
Well, you have your story, I have
mine.  I say I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

Person_5
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped
and you could use it as a pretext to
make some money disappear.  All you
needed was a sap to pin it on, and
you'd just met me.  You thought,
hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone
the square community won't give a
shit about.

Side_5
Well?  Aren't you?

Person_5
Well. . . yeah.

Side_5
All right, get out.  Both of you.

Side_2
Look at that fucking phony, Dude!
Pretending to be a fucking
millionaire!

Side_5
I said out.  Now.

Side_2
Let me tell you something else.
I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude,
and this guy is a fake.  A fucking
goldbricker.

Side_2
This guy fucking walks.  I've never
been more certain of anything in my
life!

Side_5
Stay away from me, mister!

Side_2
Walk, you fucking phony!

Side_5
Put me down, you son of a bitch!

Person_5
Walter!

Side_2
It's all over, man!  We call your
fucking bluff!

Side_2
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!

Side_2
Oh, shit.

Side_5
You're bullies!  Cowards, both of
you!

Side_2
Oh, shit.

Person_5
He can't walk, Walter!

Side_2
Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

Side_5
You monsters!

Person_5
Help me put him back in his chair.

Side_2
Shit, sorry man.

Side_5
Stay away from me!  You bullies!
You and these women!  You won't leave
a man his fucking balls!

Person_5
Walter, you fuck!

Side_2
Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I
wouldn't've done it if I knew he was
a fucking crybaby.

Person_5
We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

Person_5
There ya go.  Sorry man.

Side_2
Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

Side_2
Sure you'll see some tank battles.
But fighting in desert is very
different from fighting in canopy
jungle.

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_2
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war
whereas, uh, this thing should be a
fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an
M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking
tank.  Just me and Charlie, man,
eyeball to eyeball.

Person_5
Yeah.

Side_2
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in
the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy
fuckin' adversary.

Side_3
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

Side_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch
of fig-eaters with towels on their
heads tryin' to find reverse on a
Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

Side_13
What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!

Side_13
What is this bullshit, man?  I don't
fucking care!  It don't matter to
Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!
You might fool the fucks in the league
office, but you don't fool Jesus!
It's bush league psych-out stuff!
Laughable, man!  I would've fucked
you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck
you in the ass next Wednesday instead!

Side_13
You got a date Wednesday, man!

Side_2
He's cracking.

Side_2
A tree of life, Dude.  To all who
cling to it.

Person_5
They finally did it.  They killed my
fucking car.

Side_19
Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

Side_42
Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

Side_43
Ja, it seems you forgot our little
deal, Lebowski.

Person_5
You don't have the fucking girl,
dipshits.  We know you never did.
So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

Side_3
Are these the Nazis, Walter?

Side_2
They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to
be afraid of.

Side_19
Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat

Side_2
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

Person_5
Hey, cool it Walter.

is.  Those are the fucking rules.

Side_19
Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

Side_42
His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She

dollars!  Iss not fair!

Side_2

Person_5
Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal,

Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase,
man, so take it up with him.

Side_3
Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

Side_2
They won't hurt us, Donny.  These
men are cowards.

Side_19
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on

Person_5
Come on, Walter, we're ending this

Person_5
Four dollars here!

Person_5
Almost five!

Side_3
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

Side_2
What's mine is mine.

Side_2
Come and get it.

Side_2
Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

Side_2
Show me what you got.  Nihilist.
Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

Side_2
We've got a man down, Dude.

Person_5
Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

Side_2
No Dude.

Person_5
They shot Donny!

Side_2
There weren't any shots.

Person_5
Then what's...

Side_2
It's a heart attack.

Person_5
Wha.

Side_2
Call the medics, Dude.

Person_5
Wha. . . Donny--

Side_2
Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping
blood.  Might pass out.

Side_2
Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing
fine.  We got help choppering in.

Side_1
Hello, gentlemen.  You are the
bereaved?

Person_5
Yeah man.

Side_1
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet
you.

Person_5
Jeffrey Lebowski.

Side_2
Walter Sobchak.

Person_5
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

Side_45
Excuse me?

Person_5
Nothing.

Side_45
Yes.  I understand you're taking
away the remains.

Side_2
Yeah.

Side_45
We have the urn.

Side_45
And I assume this is credit card?

Side_2
Yeah.

Side_2
What's this?

Side_45
That is for the urn.

Side_2
Don't need it.  We're scattering the
ashes.

Side_45
Yes, so we were informed.  However,
we must of course transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

Side_2
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

Side_45
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

Person_5
Well can we--

Side_2
A hundred and eighty dollars?!

Side_45
They range up to three thousand.

Side_2
Yeah, but we're--

Person_5
Can we just rent it from you?

Side_45
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental
house.

Side_2
We're scattering the fucking ashes!

Person_5
Walter--

Side_45
Sir, please lower your voice--

Person_5
Hey man, don't you have something
else you could put it in?

Side_45
That is our most modestly priced
receptacle.

Side_2
I'll say a few words.

Side_2
Donny was a good bowler, and a good
man.  He was. . . He was one of us.
He was a man who loved the outdoors,
and bowling, and as a surfer explored
the beaches of southern California
from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he
was an avid bowler.  And a good
friend.  He died--he died as so many
of his generation, before his time.
In your wisdom you took him, Lord.
As you took so many bright flowering
young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc
and Hill 364.  These young men gave
their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny
who. . . who loved bowling.

Side_2
And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,
in accordance with what we think
your dying wishes might well have
been, we commit your mortal remains
to the bosom of.

Side_2
the Pacific Ocean, which you loved
so well.

Side_2
Goodnight, sweet prince.

Side_2
Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

Side_2
Goddamn wind.

Person_5
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking
asshole!

Side_2
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

Person_5
You make everything a fucking
travesty!

Side_2
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

Person_5
What about that shit about Vietnam!

Side_2
Dude, I'm sorry--

Person_5
What the fuck does Vietnam have to
do with anything!  What the fuck
were you talking about?!

Side_2
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

Person_5
You're a fuck, Walter!

Side_2
Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

Person_5
Two oat sodas, Gary.

Side_30
Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

Person_5
Thanks, man.

Side_30
Sorry to hear about Donny.

Person_5
Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you
eat the bear, and, uh.

Side_32
Howdy do, Dude.

Person_5
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered
if I'd see you again.

Side_32
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things
been goin'?

Person_5
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

Side_32
Sure, I gotcha.

Person_5
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I
gotta get back.

Side_32
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know
that you will.

Person_5
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude
abides.

Side_32
The Dude abides.

Side_32
I don't know about you, but I take
comfort in that.  It's good knowin'
he's out there, the Dude, takin' her
easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I
sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp,
that about does her, wraps her all
up.  Things seem to've worked out
pretty good for the Dude'n Walter,
and it was a purt good story, dontcha
think?   Made me laugh to beat the
band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I
didn't like seein' Donny go. But
then, happen to know that there's a
little Lebowski on the way.  I guess
that's the way the whole durned human
comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self,
down through the generations, westward
the wagons, across the sands a time
until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin'
again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed
yourselves.

Side_32
Catch ya further on down the trail.

Side_32
...Say friend, ya got any more a
that good sarsaparilla?...

Person_3
Wow.

Person_4
Mmm.

Person_3
Wow.

Person_4
Mmm-hmm.

Person_3
Wow.

Person_4
Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.

Person_4
My man delivered.

Person_3
And it wasn't so easy.

Person_4
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

Person_3
You better believe they did--every single one of them.

Person_4
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

Person_3
So, you do like it, don't you?

Person_4
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

Person_3
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

Person_4
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

Person_3
Oh, right. Right.

Person_4
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

Person_3
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

Person_4
I like Nemo.

Person_3
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

Person_4
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

Person_3
Yeah. What if they don't like me?

Person_4
Marlin.

Person_3
No, really.

Person_4
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

Person_4
What?

Person_3
You remember how we met?

Person_4
Well, I try not to.

Person_3
Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

Person_4
Marlin!

Person_4
Get away!

Person_3
Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

Person_3
No!

Person_3
Coral! Coral?

Person_3
Coral? Oh!

Person_3
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

Person_5
First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

Person_3
I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

Person_5
Not you, dad. Me!

Person_3
Okay...huh?

Person_5
Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

Person_3
All right, I'm up.

Person_5
Oh boy--whoa!

Person_3
Nemo!

Person_5
First day of school!

Person_5
No.

Person_3
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

Person_5
No.

Person_3
Are you woozy?

Person_5
No.

Person_3
How many stripes do I have?

Person_5
I'm fine.

Person_3
Answer the stripe question!

Person_5
Three.

Person_3
No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

Person_5
Lucky.

Person_3
Let's see.

Person_3
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

Person_5
Come on, dad. It's time for school.

Person_3
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

Person_5
Ohh...

Person_3
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

Person_5
Yes.

Person_3
Brush.

Person_5
Okay, I'm done.

Person_3
You missed a spot.

Person_5
Where?

Person_3
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

Person_3
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

Person_5
It's not safe.

Person_3
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

Person_5
Dad..

Person_3
All right. Come on, boy.

Person_5
Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

Person_5
Have you ever met a shark?

Person_3
No, and I don't plan to.

Person_5
How old are sea turtles?

Person_3
Sea turtles? I don't know.

Person_5
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

Person_3
Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

Person_5
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

Person_3
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

Person_6
Bye, mom!

Person_7
I'll pick you up after school.

Person_8
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

Person_3
Come on, we'll try over there.

Person_3
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

Person_9
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

Person_3
Yes. Shocking, I know.

Person_9
Marty, right?

Person_3
Marlin.

Person_9
Bob.

Side_1
Ted.

Side_2
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

Person_9/TED
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

Person_3
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

Side_2
Aw, come on, clownie.

Side_1
Yeah, do something funny.

Person_9
Yeah!

Person_3
All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

Person_9
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

Side_4
Whoa!

Side_5
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

Person_5
Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

Person_3
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

Person_3
That's where I would play

Side_6
What's wrong with his fin?

Side_7
He looks funny!

Side_8
Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

Person_9
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

Person_3
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

Person_5
Dad.

Side_6
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

Side_7
I'm obnoxious.

Side_4
Mr. Ray!

Side_8
Come on, Nemo.

Person_3
Whoa, you better stay with me.

Side_9
Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

Person_5
Dad, you can go now.

Side_9
Well, hello. Who is this?

Person_5
I'm Nemo.

Side_9
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

Person_5
Okay.

Side_9
You live in what kind of home?

Person_5
An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

Side_9
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

Person_3
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

Person_5
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

Side_9
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

Side_10
Aw, man!

Person_3
Bye, Nemo!

Person_5
Bye, dad!

Person_3
Bye, son! Be safe.

Person_9
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

Person_3
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

Side_2
Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

Person_3
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

Person_9
Hey, Marty. Calm down.

Person_3
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

Person_9
'Pony boy'?

Side_2
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

Side_1
Pity.

Person_5
Whoa.

Side_7
Come on, let's go.

Person_5
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

Side_7
Cool.

Side_7
Saved your life!

Side_6
Aw, you guys made me ink.

Person_5
What's that?

Side_7
I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

Person_5
Whoa.

Side_6
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

Side_8
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

Side_6
Okay. Beat that.

Side_7
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

Person_5
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.

Person_3
Nemo, no!

Person_5
Dad?

Person_3
You were about to swim into open water!

Person_5
No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

Person_3
It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

Side_6
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

Side_7
Yeah, he was too afraid.

Person_5
No, I wasn't.

Person_3
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

Person_5
I can swim fine, dad, okay?

Person_3
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

Person_5
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

Person_3
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

Person_5
I hate you.

Side_9
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

Person_3
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

Side_9
Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

Side_11
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

Person_3
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

Person_3
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--

Person_5
Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

Person_3
I'm coming, Nemo!

Side_4
Aaaah!

Side_9
Get under me, kids!

Person_5
Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

Person_3
Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

Side_12
Whoa! Hold on.

Person_3
Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

Person_3
Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

Side_13
Look out!

Person_3
Waaaah!

Person_3
Ooh, ooh...

Side_13
Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

Person_3
He's gone, he's gone..

Side_13
There, there. It's all right.

Person_3
He's gone.

Side_13
It'll be okay.

Person_3
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

Side_13
Hey, I've seen a boat.

Person_3
You have?

Side_13
It passed by not too long ago.

Person_3
A white one?

Side_13
Hi. I'm Dory.

Person_3
Where!? Which way!?

Side_13
Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

Side_13
No problem.

Person_3
Hey! Wait!

Side_13
Will you quit it?

Person_3
What?

Side_13
I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

Person_3
Huh?

Side_13
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

Person_3
Wait a minute..

Side_13
Stop following me, okay!?

Person_3
What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

Side_13
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

Person_3
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

Side_13
I did? Oh dear...

Person_3
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

Side_13
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

Person_3
Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

Side_13
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

Side_14
Hello.

Side_13
Well, hi!

Side_14
Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

Person_3
Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

Side_14
Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

Side_14
Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

Side_13
Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

Person_3
Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

Side_14
Oh, come on, I insist.

Person_3
O-okay..that's all that matters.

Side_13
Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

Side_14
Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

Side_14
Anchor! Chum!

Side_15
There you are, Bruce, finally!

Side_14
We got company.

Side_15
It's about time, mate.

Side_16
We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

Side_15
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

Side_16
Come on, let's get this over with.

Side_14
Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

Side_14/ANCHOR/CHUM
'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

Side_15
Except stinkin' dolphins.

Side_16
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

Side_14
Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A FISH FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

Side_15
Got mine.

Side_13
Hey there!

Side_14
How 'bout you, Chum?

Side_16
Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.

Side_14
That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

Side_16
Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

Side_14
I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

Side_15/CHUM
Hello, Bruce.

Side_14
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

Side_16
You're an inspiration to all of us.

Side_15
Amen.

Side_14
Right, then. Who's next?

Side_13
Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

Side_14
Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

Side_13
Woo-hoo!

Side_14
Come on up here.

Side_13
Hi. I'm Dory.

Side_14/ANCHOR/CHUM
Hello, Dory.

Side_13
And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

Side_16
Hey, that's incredible.

Side_14
Good on 'ya, mate!

Side_13
Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

Side_14
All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

Person_3
Me? I don't have a problem.

Side_14
Oh. Okay..

Side_14/ANCHOR/CHUM
Denial.

Side_14
Just start with your name.

Person_3
Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

Side_16
A clownfish? Really?!

Side_14
Go on, tell us a joke!

Side_16
Ooh! I love jokes!

Person_3
Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

Person_5
Daddy!

Person_3
Nemo!

Side_16
Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

Side_14
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

Person_3
No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

Side_13
Oh my, you poor fish.

Side_16
Humans. Think they own everything.

Side_15
Probably American.

Side_14
Now there is a father looking for his little boy.

Person_3
Ugh! What do these markings mean?

Side_16
Aw, come here.

Side_15
Group hug.

Side_16
We're all mates here, mate.

Person_3
I can't read human.

Side_13
Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!

Person_3
No, no, no, Dory!

Side_13
Guys, guys!

Person_3
No, Dory!

Side_13
That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!

Person_3
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

Side_13
Ow, ow, ow.

Person_3
I'm so sorry.

Side_13
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

Person_3
Ohh...

Side_13
Ow, ow, ow.

Side_14
Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.

Side_15/CHUM
Intervention!

Side_14
Just a bite!

Side_15
Hold it together, mate!

Side_16
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

Person_3
Dory, look out!

Side_14
I'm havin' fish tonight!

Side_16
Remember the steps, mate!

Side_14
Just one bite!

Side_14
G'day!

Person_3/DORY
Aaaaaaaah!

Side_14
Arrrr!

Person_3
There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

Side_13
Who is it?

Person_3
Dory, help me find a way out!

Side_13
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

Person_3
There's gotta be a way out!

Side_13
Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled
just like the word 'escape'.

Person_3
Let's go!

Side_14
Here's Brucey!

Side_13
I can read? That's right, I can read!

Person_3
Well, then here. Read this now!

Side_15
He really doesn't mean it, y'know! He never even knew his father!

Side_16
Don't fall off the wagon!

Person_3
Oh no, it's blocked!

Side_15
No, Bruce. Focus!

Side_16
Sorry about--this, mate!

Side_15
He's really--a nice guy!

Person_3
I need to get that mask!

Side_13
You want that mask? Okay.

Person_3
No, no, no, no, no, no!

Person_3
Quick grab the mask!

Side_15
Oh no. Bruce?

Side_13
Aw, is the party over?

Side_20
Nice.

Person_5
Dad? Daddy?

Side_21
Barbara?

Side_22
Uh-huh?

Side_21
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

Side_22
Okay.

Side_21
Hello, little fella!

Person_5
Aah!

Side_21
Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and
I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?

Side_23
I think so. We're ready to roll.

Side_25
He likes bubbles.

Person_5
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

Side_26
Bonjour.

Person_5
Aah!

Side_27
Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

Side_28
Oh, he's scared to death.

Person_5
I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?

Side_25
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

Person_5
Pet store?

Side_27
Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

Side_29
Pet Palace.

Side_24
Fish-O-Rama.

Side_28
Mail order.

Side_25
Ebay.

Side_29
So which one is it?

Person_5
I'm from the ocean.

Side_29
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

Side_26
Oui.

Side_29
Clean him!

Side_26
Oui.

Side_29
Ocean!

Side_26
Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean.

Side_24
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

Person_5
Big...and blue?

Side_24
I knew it.

Side_28
Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not
around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything
my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!

Side_27
Can't hear you, Peach.

Side_25
I said we got a live one.

Side_29
Yes!

Side_27
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

Side_28
What do we got?

Side_25
Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.

Side_23
Owwwwwwwww!

Side_27
Rubber dam and clamp installed?

Side_25
Yep.

Side_29
What did he use to open?

Side_25
Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

Side_28
I can't see, Flo.

Side_23
You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!

Side_25
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

Side_27
Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

Side_29
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

Side_27
It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

Side_29
No, no. K-Flex.

Side_27
Hedstrom!

Side_29
K-Flex!

Side_28
I'll go deflate him.

Side_21
All right, go ahead and rinse.

Side_29
Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.

Side_25
Hey, Nigel.

Side_30
What did I miss? Am I late?

Side_25
Root canal and it's a doozy.

Side_30
Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?

Side_25
Gator-Glidden drill.

Side_30
He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus...
hello.

Side_30
Who's this?

Side_28
New guy. Ha ha ha!

Side_29
The dentist took him off the reef.

Side_21
Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh,
the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week.
Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're
her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up
I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby.

Side_27
Oh, Darla.

Person_5
What? What's wrong with her?

Side_29
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

Side_24
Poor Chuckles.

Side_28
He was her present last year.

Side_27
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

Side_25
She's a fish killer.

Person_5
I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!

Side_29
Oh, he's stuck!

Person_5
Can you help me?

Side_31
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

Side_25
Gill..

Side_31
I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

Person_5
I can't. I have a bad fin.

Side_31
Never stopped me.

Side_31
Just think about what you need to do.

Side_27
Come on.

Side_31
Perfect.

Side_24
Yay!

Side_29
You did it!

Side_28
Good squirming! Ha ha ha!

Side_25
Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

Side_31
Yeah.

Side_25
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

Side_31
I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

Side_27
So kid, you got a name or what?

Person_5
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

Side_13
Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...

Person_3
Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!

Side_13
Sea monkey has my money...

Person_3
Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!

Side_13
Yes, I'm a natural blue...

Side_13
Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aaaaaah!

Side_13
Wow. Dusty.

Person_3
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

Side_13
Did you drop it?

Person_3
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.

Side_13
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?

Person_3
I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.

Person_3
Dory, no singing.

Person_3
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!

Side_13
Sorry.

Person_3
Dory, do you see anything?

Side_13
Aaah! Something's got me!

Person_3
That was me. I'm sorry.

Person_3
Who could it be? It's me!

Side_13
Are..are you my conscience?

Person_3
Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

Side_13
Hmm, can't complain.

Person_3
Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?

Side_13
I see..I see a light.

Person_3
A light.

Side_13
Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?

Person_3
No, I see it too. What is it?

Side_13
It's so pretty.

Person_3
I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.

Side_13
I want to touch it. Oh!

Person_3
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

Person_3
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.

Person_3
I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

Side_13
Haah!

Person_3
The mask!

Side_13
What mask?

Side_13
Okay, I can't see a thing.

Person_3
Oh, gee!

Side_13
Hey, look! A mask!

Person_3
Read it!

Side_13
I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That's great, keep it right there.

Person_3
Just read it!

Side_13
Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh!
The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

Person_3
P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!

Side_13
Okay, second line. '42'.

Person_3
Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

Side_13
Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'...

Person_3
Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

Side_13
The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!

Person_3
That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure!
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!

Side_13
'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!

Person_3
Duck!

Side_13
Aaah!

Person_3
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

Person_3
Dory.

Person_3
Dory! What did the mask say?

Person_3
Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?

Side_13
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!

Person_3/DORY
Aaah!

Side_13
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

Side_26
Psst. Nemo.

Person_5
Mmmm...

Side_26
Nemo.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_26
Suivez-moi. Follow me.

Side_31
State your name.

Person_5
Nemo.

Side_31
Brother Bloat, proceed.

Side_27
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

Person_5
Huh?

Side_25
We want you in our club, kid.

Person_5
Really?

Side_24
Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!

Side_25
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!

Side_31
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

Side_27/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

Side_31
Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

Side_27/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

Side_31
Enough with the Sharkbait.

Side_29
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.

Side_31
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

Side_27/BUBBLES/GURGLE
Agreed!

Side_31
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.

Person_5
Escape? Really?

Side_31
We're all gonna escape!

Side_29
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

Side_28
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.

Side_27
Yeah. Why should this be any different?

Side_31
'Cause we've got him.

Person_5
Me?

Side_31
You see that filter?

Person_5
Yeah?

Side_31
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?

Side_27
Aye!

Side_26
Aye!

Side_28
Aye!

Side_24
Aye!

Side_29
I think your nuts.

Side_29
No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.

Side_31
He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?

Person_5
Let's do it.

Side_13
I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P.
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's
where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...

Side_13
P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell
you again. I don't get tired of it--

Person_3
Okay, all right.

Side_13
Huh?

Person_3
Here's the thing.

Person_3
Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself.

Side_13
Okay.

Person_3
Y'know, alone.

Side_13
Uh-huh.

Person_3
Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you...
with me.

Side_13
Huh?

Person_3
I don't wanna hurt your feelings..

Side_13
You want me to leave?

Person_3
Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays
and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's
a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.

Person_3
No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.

Side_35
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?

Side_13
Um, I don't remember. Were you?

Person_3
No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--

Side_35
Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?

Side_13
Mm-mmm-mmmm.

Side_35
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.

Side_13
Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.

Side_35
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

Side_13
Wait, wait, um..

Person_3
It's a swordfish.

Side_35
Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?

Side_13
Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.

Side_35
Saw that.

Person_3
What?

Side_35
Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.

Side_13
Clam!

Side_13
Oh, they're good.

Person_3
Will somebody please give me directions?

Side_13
Ha ha ha ha ha!

Person_3
I'm serious.

Side_35
Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!

Person_3
Thank you.

Side_13
Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?

Person_3
What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from
home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

Side_13
Boy, bet that's frustrating.

Person_3
Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.

Side_13
You're son Chico?

Person_3
Nemo.

Side_13
Right. Got it.

Person_3
But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.

Side_13
Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.

Side_35
What, is he bothering you again?

Side_13
No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

Side_35
Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

Side_36
Sure do.

Side_13
Oh, hey! They know Sydney!

Side_13
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

Side_35
What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current,
can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I
don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna
put you right past Sydney.

Person_3
Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!

Side_13
Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.

Person_3
Well, listen fellas, thank you.

Side_35
Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?

Side_13
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

Side_35
Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.

Side_13
Yes.

Side_35
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

Side_13
Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner.
Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello!
Okay, let's go.

Person_3
Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.

Side_13
Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through
it, not over it.

Person_3
Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.

Side_13
I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.

Person_3
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

Side_13
Come on, trust me on this.

Person_3
Trust you?

Side_13
Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

Person_3
Look! Something shiny!

Person_3
Oh, it just swam over the trench. Come on, we'll follow it.

Side_13
Okay.

Side_13
Boy, sure is clear up here.

Person_3
Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.

Side_13
Hey, little guy.

Person_3
You wanted to go through the trench.

Person_3
Dory! That's a jellyfish!

Side_13
Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

Person_3
Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

Side_13
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

Person_3
I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.

Side_13
Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?

Person_3
It did. It's just that..

Side_13
Ow! Ow, oww!

Person_3
..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings.
Come here.

Side_13
Ow, ow! Oww!

Person_3
It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?

Side_13
Yeah.

Person_3/DORY
Aaaah!

Person_3
Don't move! This is bad, Dory.

Side_13
Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!

Person_3
Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you,
that's it!

Side_13
Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.

Person_3
Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

Side_13
A game?

Person_3
A game.

Side_13
A game?

Person_3
Yes.

Side_13
Aah! I love games! Pick me!

Person_3
All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

Side_13
Okay!

Person_3
Rules, rules, rules!

Side_13
Okay!

Person_3
You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.

Side_13
Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

Person_3
W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!

Side_13
Weeee!

Person_3
Dory!

Side_13
Gotta go faster if you wanna win!

Side_13
Boing! Boing! Boing-boing-boing-boing!

Person_3
Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!

Side_13
Weeee!

Person_3
So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time.
I can do this, just be careful.

Side_13
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!

Person_3
Oh, I don't think so!

Side_13
Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.

Person_3
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

Side_13
Huh? Hungry?

Side_13
Ugh...am I disqualified?

Person_3
No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where
does P. Sherman live?

Side_13
P..Sherman..Wallaby Way...Sydney...

Person_3
That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake!

Side_13
Awake...P..Sherman..

Person_3
Awake...

Side_13
..42 Wallaby Way...

Person_3
Awake...wake up...Nemo...

Side_31
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

Person_5
Yeah.

Side_31
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you.

Person_5
He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.

Side_31
Peach, any movement?

Side_25
He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon.

Side_31
Keep on him.

Side_31
My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.

Person_5
Toilet?

Side_31
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

Person_5
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

Side_31
Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya.

Side_24
Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles---

Side_25
Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.

Side_31
That's your cue, Sharkbait.

Side_27
You can do it, kid.

Side_31
Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber
and I'll talk you through the rest.

Person_5
Okay.

Side_31
Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp.

Side_31
Nicely done! Can you hear me?

Person_5
Yeah.

Side_31
Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_31
Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the
fan to stop it turning.

Person_5
Aaah!

Side_31
Careful, Sharkbait.

Person_5
I can't do it!

Side_25
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

Side_31
He'll be fine. Try again.

Person_5
Okay.

Side_31
That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

Person_5
I got it! I got it!

Side_27
He did it!

Side_29
Whew!

Side_31
That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.

Person_5
Oh no! Gill! Gill!

Side_31
Sharkbait!

Side_27
Oh my gosh!

Side_31
Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there!

Side_24
Help him!

Side_29
What do we do!? What do we do!?

Side_25
Oh no!

Side_31
Stay calm, kid! Just don't panic!

Person_5
Help me!

Side_31
Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!

Person_5
No! No!

Side_31
Feed me more!

Side_29
That's it!

Side_31
Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!

Person_5
I got it!

Side_31
Pull!

Side_25
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

Side_31
No. We're done.

Side_37
Dude.

Person_3
Ooh...

Side_37
Dude. Focus, dude. Dude.

Person_3
Ooooh...

Side_37
Oh, he lives! Hey, dude!

Person_3
Ooooh..what happened?

Side_37
Oh, saw the whole thing, dude. First you were like, 'whoa'! And then we were all like,
'whoa'! And then you were like, 'whoa'.

Person_3
What're you talking about?

Side_37
You, mini-man. Takin' on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude.

Person_3
Ooh.

Side_37
Awesome.

Person_3
Ooh..ooh, my stomach. Ooooh..

Side_37
Oh, man. No hurlin' on the shell, dude, okay, just waxed it.

Person_3
So Mr. Turtle...

Side_37
Whoa, dude. Mr. Turtle is my father. Name's Crush.

Person_3
Crush? Really? Okay Crush, listen I need to get to the East Australian Current. EAC?

Side_37
Ha ha ha, dude, ha ha, you're ridin' it, dude! Check it out!

Side_37
Okay, grab shell, dude!

Person_3
Grabbing--waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaaaaaaaah!!! Whooooooaaaa!!!

Side_37
Ha ha! Righteous! Righteous! Yeah!

Person_3
Stop!

Side_37
So, what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?

Side_37
Oh. Oh, Little Blue. She is sub-level, dude.

Person_3
Dory, Dory! Dory!

Side_13
Hmm-mmm....

Person_3
Oh, Dory. I-I-I'm so sorry. This is all my fault, it's my fault...

Side_13
..29, 30! Ready or not, here I come! There you are! Catch me if you can! Ha ha!
Ha ha ha ha!

Person_3
Huh?

Side_38
Whoa!

Side_37
Whoa. Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

Side_38
Whoa! Whoa! That was so cool! Hey dad, did you see that? Did you see me? Did you see
what I did?

Side_37
You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin..noggin..

Side_37/SQUIRT
..dude!

Side_37
Oh, intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

Side_38
Jellies? Sweet.

Side_37
Totally.

Person_3
Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes.

Side_38
You rock, dude.

Person_3
Ow.

Side_37
Curl away, my son. Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em
on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue.

Person_3
All by themselves?

Side_37
Yeah.

Person_3
But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?

Side_37
Well, you never really know. But when they'll know, you'll know, you know? Ha.

Side_13
Hey! Look, everybody!

Side_38
I know that dude. It's the Jellyman.

Side_13
Well, go on, jump on him.

Side_40
Turtle pile!

Person_3
W-w-wai-wait--

Side_41
Are you funny?

Side_42
Where's your shell?

Person_3
Hold on, I need to breath--

Side_43
Are you running away?

Side_44
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?

Side_45
Did they sting you?

Person_3
One at a time!

Side_46
Mr. Fish, did you die?

Side_13
Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

Side_38
So where are you going?

Person_3
Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

Side_13
No way.

Side_38
What happened?

Person_3
No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.

Side_40
Awww! Please?

Side_38
Pleeeease?

Side_13
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

Person_3
And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been
so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...

Side_47
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

Side_48
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

Side_49
Golly, that's amazing!

Side_48
And then dives thousands of..

Side_50
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

Side_51
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...

Side_52
So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.

Side_53
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

Side_54
..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

Side_55
..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

Side_56
That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_30
Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!

Side_20
..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo.

Side_30
Nemo?

Side_20
He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

Side_30
There, take it! You happy!

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_30
Hey, hey, hey! Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_58
Whooooooaaa..watcha!

Side_59
Mine!

Side_20
Last I heard, he's headin' towards the harbor.

Side_30
Ho ho! Brilliant!

Side_28
Is he doing okay?

Side_29
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R..

Person_5
It's okay, I know who you're talking about.

Person_5
Gill? Gill?

Side_31
Hey, Sharkbait.

Person_5
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

Side_31
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that
ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that.
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

Side_30
All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--!

Side_21
What the!?

Side_23
AAAAAAAAAH!!! Oooooh...

Side_21
Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth. He he he he he! Huh, darn kids. Well, good
thing I pulled the right one, eh, prime minister? He he he he!

Side_30
Hey, hey. Psst!

Side_25
Oh, Nigel. You just missed an extraction.

Side_30
Ooh! Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what I'm talkin' about!? Nemo!
Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.

Person_5
What? What is it?

Side_30
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

Person_5
My father? Really?

Side_31
Really?

Side_30
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and
all sorts of--

Person_5
Sharks? That can't be him.

Side_30
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..

Person_5
Marlin?

Side_30
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

Person_5
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

Side_30
I heard he took on three.

Side_28/BLOAT/GURGLE
Three!?

Side_31
Three sharks!?

Side_27
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!

Side_30
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.

Person_5
Really?

Side_30
He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him   and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with   huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right
now, to Sydney!

Side_27
Wow! Ha ha ha!

Side_28
Oh, what a good daddy!

Side_31
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.

Side_29
He's swimming to the filter!

Side_27
Not again!

Side_31
Sharkbait!

Side_28
No!

Side_29
You've got your whole life ahead of you!

Side_27
Oh no!

Side_31
We'll help you, kid!

Side_27
Gotta get him out!

Side_28
Gimme that thing!

Side_28
Get him outta there!

Side_29
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

Side_28
Sharkbait!

Side_27
Sharkbait! Are you okay!?

Side_29
No!

Side_31
Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!?

Person_5
Yeah, I can hear you.

Side_31
Sharkbait, you did it!

Side_29
Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs! Aaaaaaah!!!

Side_31
That took guts, kid.

Side_26
Oui!

Side_31
No cleaning.

Side_26
I shall resist.

Side_31
Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank
so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.

Side_31
Good work.

Person_5
Ha ha ha ha!

Side_37
All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!

Person_3
Where!? I don't see it!

Side_13
Right there! I see it! I see it!

Person_3
You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?

Side_37
That's it, dude!

Person_3
Of course it is.

Side_37
Okay, first: find your exit buddy!

Side_37
Do you have your exit buddy?

Side_13
Yes!

Side_37
Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!

Side_38
Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today! Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit
the wall! There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and
punch it!

Person_3
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't
know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!

Side_37
Okay, Jellyman! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

Person_3/DORY
Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!!
Whoooooaaa!!!

Side_13
Whoooo!

Side_13
Hey, look! Turtles!

Side_37
Ha ha! Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through
to Sydney! No worries, man!

Person_3
No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

Side_40
Bye! Bye, Jellyman!

Side_37
You tell your little dude I said 'hi', okay?

Side_38
See you later, dudes!

Side_13
Bye, everyone!

Person_3
Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?

Side_37
Hundred and fifty, dude! And still young! Rock on!

Person_3
Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that.

Side_13
Whoa. We goin' in there?

Person_3
Yup.

Side_13
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

Person_3
Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.

Person_3
Dory?

Person_3
Boy, this is taking a while.

Side_13
Hey, how about we play a game?

Person_3
Okay.

Side_13
Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small..

Person_3
It's me.

Side_13
Right. Okay..

Side_13
..orange, and uh, small..

Person_3
It's me.

Side_13
All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.

Side_13
..orange and small, and white stripes..

Person_3
Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.

Side_13
Okay, that's just scary.

Person_3
W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!

Side_13
Hey. Hey!

Person_3
We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
Wha--?

Side_13
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

Person_3
Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!

Person_3
Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out
our bones!

Side_13
What is it with men and asking for directions?

Person_3
Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
'Let's Not Die' card.

Side_13
You wanna get outta here, don't you?

Person_3
Of course, I do.

Side_13
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm?
Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.

Person_3
All right.

Side_13
Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.

Person_3
Ha..hello.

Side_13
His son Bingo..

Person_3
Nemo.

Side_13
..Nemo, was taken to, uh..

Person_3
Sydney.

Person_3
Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.

Side_13
Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale.

Person_3
Uh, Dory..what're you doing?

Person_3
What're you doing?

Person_3
Are you sure you speak whale?

Person_3
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.

Person_3
He's not coming back. You offended him.

Side_13
Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!

Person_3
Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.

Side_13
Maybe I should try humpback.

Person_3
No, don't try humpback.

Person_3
Okay, you actually sound sick.

Side_13
Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!

Person_3
Don't do that!

Side_13
Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?

Person_3
It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!

Person_3
It's just as well, he might be hungry.

Side_13
Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill.

Side_13
Oh, look. Krill.

Person_3
Move, Dory! Move!

Side_13
Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

Side_31
Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to
you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning!

Side_26
I am ashamed.

Side_25
Hey, look. Scum angel.

Side_29
Aah! Aaaah! Ooh-ooh! Aaaaah!

Side_28
Flo! Flo! Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

Side_25
Nine o' clock and cue dentist.

Side_21
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

Side_25
Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go, okay.

Side_21
Little Davey Reynolds.

Side_25
Okay. Walks to the counter, drops the keys..

Side_29
Bloat, that's disgusting!

Side_29
Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own--

Side_25
Shhh! Here he comes.

Side_21
Crikey, what a state. Oh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

Side_22
Uh, ten 'o clock, luv.

Side_21
Leave it open, would you? I gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

Side_31
He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

Person_5
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean!

Side_31
Are you ready to see your dad, kid?

Person_5
Uh-huh.

Side_31
Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor
waitin' for you right now.

Person_5
Yeah.

Person_3
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!

Side_13
Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!

Person_3
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

Side_13
Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!

Person_3
Would you just stop it!?

Side_13
Why? What's wrong?

Person_3
We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?

Side_13
A whale?

Person_3
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!

Side_13
Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.

Side_13
Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?

Side_13
There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay.

Person_3
No. No, it won't.

Side_13
Sure it will, you'll see.

Person_3
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

Side_13
Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.

Person_3
What?

Side_13
Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.

Side_13
Hmm..

Person_3
What's going on?

Side_13
I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..

Person_3
Dory. Dory.

Person_3
Dory.

Side_13
I think he says we've stopped.

Side_13
Really? You sure about that?

Person_3
Look, it's already half-empty!

Side_13
Hmm..I'd say it's half full.

Person_3
Stop that! It's half-empty!

Side_13
Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat
or he wants a root beer float.

Person_3
Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!?
Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!

Side_13
Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--

Person_3
Stop talking to him--waaaah!

Side_13
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

Person_3
What is going on!?

Side_13
I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--!

Person_3
No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!

Side_13
Yes, I can!

Person_3
No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!

Side_13
Okay.

Person_3
Dory!

Side_13
He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!

Side_13
I don't!

Person_3
Ha ha ha! We're alive!

Side_13
Look! Sy-d-ney..Sydney! Uh, Sydney! Sydney again!

Person_3
You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son!

Side_13
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

Person_3
Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.

Side_13
Right!

Person_3
Come on, Dory. We can do this!

Side_28
But how?

Side_31
Boss must've installed it last night while we were sleepin'.

Person_5
What're we gonna do?

Side_31
What's it say, Peach?

Side_31
I can't hear you, Peach.

Side_25
'The AquaScum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning maintenance free salt water purifier
that is guaranteed to even extend the life of your aquarium fish'.

Side_25
'The AquaScum is programmed to scan your tank environment every 5 minutes'?

Side_29
Scan? What does that mean?

Side_29
Aaah!

Side_62
Temperature: 82 degrees. PH balance: normal.

Side_61
Oooooh.

Side_25
Nice.

Side_29
Ooh..ah..curse you, AquaScum!

Side_27
That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined!

Person_5
Then what're we gonna do about--

Side_31
Stay down, kid!

Side_27
False alarm.

Side_29
My nerves can't take much more of this.

Side_27
What're we gonna do when that little brat gets here?

Side_31
I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'.

Person_5
Aaah! Oh! Gill!

Person_5
Help me! Help me!

Side_31
Hold on! I'm comin'!

Person_5
Help me!

Side_31
Swim down! Come on, kid! Swim down! Come on!

Side_27
Everybody jump in!

Side_28
Swim down!

Side_31
That's it!

Side_21
What the!?

Side_61
Yay!

Side_31
Good work!

Person_5
Gill!

Side_27
Sharkbait!

Side_21
Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.

Person_5
Gill! Don't let me go belly up!

Side_31
Just calm down, Nemo.

Person_5
Don't let me go belly up!

Side_31
You won't go belly up, I promise. You're gonna be okay.

Side_13
All right, do any of these boats look familiar to you?

Person_3
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it.

Person_3
Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on.

Person_3
That's not a duck. It's a--pelican! Whooooaaaaah!

Side_13
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

Person_3
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast!

Side_20
Hey, hey, Nigel. Heh, would you look at that?

Side_30
Huh? Wha-what?

Side_20
Sun's barely up and already Gerald's had more than he can handle.

Side_30
Yeah. Reckon somebody oughta help the poor guy.

Side_20S
Yeah, yeah, right.

Side_30
Well, don't everybody fly off at once.

Side_30
All right, Gerald, what is it? Fish got your tongue?

Side_13
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

Side_30
Love a duck!

Person_3
I gotta find my son Nemo!

Person_3
Dory, keep going! He's crazy!

Side_30
I got something to tell 'ya!

Side_59
Mine.

Side_30
Okay, don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

Person_3
Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live?

Side_59
Mine.

Side_30
Because I can take you to your son.

Person_3
Yeah, right.

Side_30
No. I know your son. He's orange, he's got a gimpy fin on one side..

Person_3
That's Nemo!

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_13
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

Side_30
Fasten your seatbelts!

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_13
Whoooooo! Woohooooo!

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_13
Ha-haaaa! Ha ha ha ha!

Person_3
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Side_30
Everybody hold on!

Person_3/DORY
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

Side_57
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_24
Aaaah! Too loud! Too loud for me!

Side_25
Find a happy place, find a happy place, find a happy place!

Side_22
Darla, you're uncle will see you now.

Side_21
All right, let's see those pearly whites.

Side_64
RAAAH! I'm a piranha. They're in the Amazon.

Side_21
And a piranha's a fish, just like your present.

Side_21
Oh no. Poor little guy.

Side_27
He's dead!

Side_31
Sharkbait!

Side_64
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

Side_21
He he he! Must've left your present in the car, sweetie. Ha ha ha ha ha!

Side_64
Awwwww.

Side_21
I'll go and get it.

Side_25
He's not dead!

Side_27
What's happening? Why is he playing dead?

Side_31
He's gonna get flushed down the toilet! He's gonna get outta here!

Side_28
Yay!

Side_27
He's gonna get flushed!

Side_29
What a smart little guy!

Side_31
Oh no, not the trash can!

Side_24
Nemo! No!

Side_30
Hey! Hey! I found his dad!

Person_3
Where's Nemo!? Where is he!?

Side_27
Dentist! Dentist!

Side_31
He's over there!

Side_30
I can't go in there.

Person_3
Oh yes, you can! Charge!

Side_64
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

Side_21
What the--!? Darla, sweetie! Look out!

Side_64
Aaaaaaaah!

Side_21
Hold still!

Side_64
Aaaaaaaah!

Side_21
Easy! Easy!

Side_64
Aaaaaaaah!

Side_21
Hold still! Nobody's going to hurt you! Oof!

Side_21
Gotcha! Keep down!

Person_3
Nemo!

Person_5
Daddy?

Side_21
Out with 'ya! And stay out!

Person_5
Daddy!?

Side_64
Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Wake up!

Side_28
Oh no!

Side_31
Quick! To the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie!

Side_64
Why are you sleeping!?

Side_25
Hurry!

Side_31
Bloat! Ring of Fire!

Side_64
Fishy--aaaaaaaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

Side_21
What!? All the animals have gone mad!

Side_64
Aaaaaaaah! Get it out!

Side_29
Smack her in the head!

Side_27
Go, Gill! Go!

Side_64
Fish in my hair! Aaaaaaaah!

Person_5
Gill.

Side_31
Sharkbait. Tell your dad..I said..hi. Go get 'em.

Side_27
He did it! Ha ha!

Side_28
Yay!

Side_24
I'm so happy!

Side_29
Is he gonna be okay, Gill?

Side_31
Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

Side_64
Fishy!

Person_5
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Daddy!

Side_30
I'm, I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.

Side_13
Hey..

Person_3
Dory. If it wasn't for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you.

Side_13
Hey! Hey, wait a minute. W-w-wait! Where are you going?

Person_3
It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now.

Side_13
No..no, you can't! Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No  one's ever stuck with me for
so long before. And if you leave, if you leave...I just,  I remember things better with you.
I do. Look, P. Sherman, 42..40..2..agh! I remember it, I  do. It's there, I know it is
because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I, I look  at you and...I'm home. Please.
I don't want them to go away. I don't wanna forget.

Person_3
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

Side_58 1
Manna from heavens!

Side_58 2
Sweet nectar of life!

Side_58 1/CRAB 2
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

Side_58 1
This is our spot!

Side_58 2
Go on! Get outta here!

Side_58 1/CRAB 2
Hey, hey! Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

Side_58 1
Yeah, that's it fella! Just keep on swimmin', you got that!

Side_58 2
Too right, mate! Oh, Oh! I got a live one here!

Person_5
Hey, have you seen my dad?

Side_58 2
Gotcha! Hey! Hey! Come back here!

Side_58 1
You let 'im go!

Side_58 1/CRAB 2
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

Person_5
Dad! Dad! Dad!

Side_13
Aah! No!

Person_5
Um, excuse me. Are you all right?

Side_13
I don't know where I am! I don't know what's going on, I think I lost somebody but I,
I can't remember.

Person_5
It's okay, it's okay. I'm looking for someone too. Hey, we can look together.

Side_13
I'm Dory.

Person_5
I'm Nemo.

Side_13
Nemo? That's a nice name.

Person_5
Dad!

Side_13
Dad!

Person_5
Dad!

Side_13
Dad! Wait a minute, is it your dad or my dad?

Person_5
My dad.

Side_13
Got it. Dad!

Person_5
Where are we, anyway?

Side_13
Aaaaah! Nemo! It's you! Aaaaaah! You're Nemo!

Person_5
My father!? You know my father!? Where is he!?

Side_13
Hey! Hey, hey! Hey!

Side_58 1/CRAB 2
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

Side_13
Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him!

Person_5
But bigger!

Side_58 2
Yeah, I saw 'im, bluey! But I'm not tellin' you where he went. And there's no way you're
gonna make me!

Side_59
Mine.

Side_58
Huh!? Aaaah! All right! I'll talk! I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds! Aaaaah!

Side_57
Mine!Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Side_68
Hey! Look out!

Person_3
Sorry. Just trying to get home.

Person_5
Dad! Dad!

Person_3
Nemo?

Person_5
Daddy!

Person_3
Nemo?

Person_5
Dad!

Side_13
Nemo's alive!

Person_5
Daddy!

Person_3
Nemo! I'm coming, Nemo!

Person_5
Dad!

Person_3
Nemo!

Person_5
Dad!

Person_3
Oh, thank goodness! It's all right, son. It's gonna be okay.

Side_68
Turn around! You're going the wrong way! Aaaaaaaaaaah!

Side_13
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Look out!

Person_3
Move! Move!

Side_68
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

Side_13
Help! AAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!

Person_3
Dory!

Person_5
Come on!

Side_13
Heeeeeeeelp!!! Help!

Person_5
Dory!

Side_13
Help! Get us out! Aaaaaaaah!

Person_3
No, no, no! No! Dory!

Person_5
Dad! I know what to do!

Person_3
Nemo! No!

Person_5
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!

Person_3
Get out of there, now!

Person_5
I know this will work!

Person_3
No, I am not gonna lose you again!

Person_5
Dad, there's no time! It's the only way we can save Dory! I can do this!

Person_3
You're right. I know you can.

Person_5
Lucky fin!

Person_3
Now go! Hurry!

Person_5
Tell all of the fish to swim down!

Person_3
Well!? You heard my son! Come on!

Person_5
Dory!

Person_5
You have to tell everybody to..

Person_3
..swim down together! Do you understand what I'm saying to you!? Swim down!

Side_13
Everybody swim down!

Person_5
Come on! You have to swim down!

Side_13
Swim down, okay?

Person_5
Swim..

Person_3
down! Swim down! Swim down! Swim down!

Person_3
Don't give up! Keep swimming! Just keep swimming!

Person_5
It's working!

Side_68
Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming!

Person_3
Just keep swimming! Keep swimming!

Person_5
Come on, dad!

Person_3
You're doing great, son!

Person_5
That's my dad!

Person_3
Come on! Let's get to the bottom! Keep swimming!

Person_3
Almost there! Keep swimming!

Side_68
Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Keep swimming! Yay!

Person_3
Oww!

Side_13
Hey!

Person_3
Dory! Where's Nemo!?

Person_3
Oh no. Nemo!

Person_3
Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you.

Person_3
Oh, thank goodness.

Person_5
Dad...I don't hate you.

Person_3
No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo.

Person_3
Hey, guess what?

Person_5
What?

Person_3
Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old.

Person_5
Hundred and fifty?

Person_3
Yep.

Person_5
'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a hundred.

Person_3
Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as
Sandy Plankton!?

Person_5
Ha ha ha ha!

Person_3
He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?

Person_3
Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go!

Person_3
I'm gonna win!

Person_5
No, you're not! I did it! Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

Person_3
Oh! My own son beats me!

Side_9
Climb aboard, explorers!

Person_3
So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these,
who needs anemones?'!

Person_9/TED/BILL
Haaa-ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Side_9
Well, hello, Nemo! Who's this?

Person_5
Exchange student.

Side_38
I'm from the EAC, dude!

Side_9
Sweet.

Person_5/SQUIRT
Totally.

Person_9
But seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did?

Side_14
Uh, pardon me.

Side_14
Hello.

Side_1
Ohh!

Side_14
Don't be alarmed.

Side_15
Oh, we just wanna make sure that our newest member got home safe.

Side_13
Thanks, guys.

Side_14
Well, we'll see you next week.

Side_16
Keep up with the program, Dory.

Side_15
Remember: fish are friends..

Side_13
..not food! Bye!

Side_9
Hold on! Here we go! Next up, knowledge!

Person_3
Bye, son! Have fun!

Person_5
Bye, dad! Oh! Oh, Mr. Ray! Wait. I forgot something.

Person_5
Love you, dad.

Person_3
I love you too, son.

Person_5
Uh, dad, you can let go now.

Person_3
Sorry! Now go have an adventure!

Side_38
Goodbye! See you later, dudes!

Side_13
Bye, Elmo!

Person_3
Nemo.

Person_5
See you after school, Dory! Bye, dad!

Person_3
Bye, son.

Side_21
Barbara?

Side_22
Uh-huh?

Side_21
I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks! Had to clean
the tank myself, take all the fish out, put 'em in bags and---where'd the fish go?

Side_31
Come on, Peach!

Side_28
Hurry!

Side_31
You can do it!

Side_27
Yeah, that's it! You can do it!

Side_29
Just a little further!

Side_25
That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!

Side_27
Come on, Peach!

Side_25
Oooh--aaaaah!

Side_61
Yay! We did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!

Side_27
Now what?

Person_1
This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have
a flash transmission for Agent Finn
McMissile.

Person_1
Finn. My cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

Person_1
You won't believe what I've found
out here.

Person_1
This is bigger than anything we've
ever seen. And no one even knows it
exists. Finn, I need backup. But
don't call the cavalry - it could
blow the operation. And be careful.
It's not safe out here!

Person_1
Transmitting my grids now. Good
luck!

Person_2
Alright buddy, we're here. Right
where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?

Person_3
I'm looking for a car.

Person_2
A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
further away from land than out
here.

Person_3
Exactly where I want to be.

Person_2
Well I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

Person_4
What are you doing out here?

Person_2
What does it look like, genius? I'm
crabbing!

Person_4
Well turn around and go back where
you came from.

Person_2
Yeah? And who's gonna make me?

Person_2
Alright, alright! Don't get your
prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?

Person_5
Too many cars here. Out of my way!

Person_3
Professor Zundapp?

Person_6
You wanted to see this before we
load it?

Person_5
Ah, yes. Very carefully...

Person_6
Oh. A TV camera. What does it
actually do?

Person_5
This camera is extremely dangerous.

Person_5
This is valuable equipment. Make
sure it is properly secured for the
voyage.

Person_6
You got it.

Person_7
This is one of those British spies
we told you about.

Person_8
Yeah. This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

Person_5
Agent Leland Turbo.

Person_5
It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
camera! Kill him!!

Person_8
He's getting away!

Person_4
Not for long.

Person_5
Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
gone, who can stop us now?

Person_9
Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
here to help you!

Person_9
Hey, Otis!

Side_1
Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
thought I could make it this time,
but...
(he tries to start his
engine, stalls)
Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
am I kidding? I'll always be a
lemon.

Person_9
Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
look on the bright side: This is
your tenth tow this month, so that
means it's on the house.

Side_1
You're the only one that's nice to
lemons like me, Mater.

Person_9
Don't sweat it. These things happen
to everybody, Otis.

Side_1
But you never leak oil.

Person_9
Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
tell nobody, but I think my rust is
starting to show through.

Side_1
Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?

Person_9
Not yet.

Side_1
He must be crazy-excited about
winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!

Person_9
Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
get back `cause we got a whole
summer's worth of best friend fun
to make up for. Just me and --

Person_9
--- McQueen!

Side_1
Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
don't need to go so fast!

Side_2
Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.

Side_3
Good to have you back, honey.

Side_4
Congratulations, man.

Side_5
Welcome home, soldier.

Side_6
The place wasn't the same without
you, son.

Side_7
What? Did he go somewhere?

Side_8
It's good to be home, everybody.

Side_8
Mater!

Person_9
McQueen!

Side_1
Woaahhhhh!

Side_9
Hey. How far'd you make it this
time, Otis?

Side_1
Halfway to the county line.

Side_9
Not bad, man.

Side_1
I know, I can't believe it either!

Person_9
McQueen, welcome back!

Side_8
Mater, it's so good to see you.

Person_9
You too, buddy.

Person_9
Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
the things I got planned for us.

Side_10
These best friend greetings get
longer every year.

Side_8
Well, actually I've got something
to show you first.

Person_9
Wow. I can't believe they renamed
the Piston Cup after our very own
Doc Hudson.

Side_8
I know Doc said these things were
just old cups, but to have someone
else win it just didn't feel right,
you know?

Person_9
Well, Doc would've been real proud
of you. That's for sure.

Side_8
Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
summer for this. What've you got
planned?

Person_9
You sure you can handle it?

Side_8
Come on, you know who you're
talking to? This is Lightning
McQueen. I can handle anything.

Side_8
Uh.... Mater?!

Person_9
Just remember, your brakes ain't
gonna work on these!

Side_8
Come on, come on! Faster, faster!

Person_9
This is gonna be good!

Person_9
Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.

Person_9
Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir?

Person_9
This new dent!

Side_8
Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...

Person_9
Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
you see what I got planned for
tonight.

Side_8
Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
thinking of just a quiet dinner.

Person_9
That's exactly what I was thinking.

Side_8
No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.

Person_9
Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
going out for supper.

Side_8
Mater, I meant it would be just me
and Sally.

Person_9
Oh.

Side_8
It's just for tonight. We'll do
whatever you want tomorrow.

Side_8
Thanks for understanding.

Person_9
Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
fun now.

Side_8
Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!

Side_11
This is so nice.

Side_8
I can't tell you how good it is to
be here alone. Just the two of us.
Finally, you and me ---

Person_9
My name is Mater and I'll be your
waiter.
Mater the waiter. That's funny
right there.

Side_8
Mater, you work here?

Person_9
Well yeah I work here. What'd you
think, I just snuck in here when
nobody was looking and pretended to
be your waiter, just so I could
hang out with you?

Side_8
Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
be?

Person_9
Now, can I start you two lovebirds
off with a couple drinks?

Side_8
Yes. I'll have my usual.

Side_11
You know what? I'm going to have
that too.

Person_9
Uh, right. Your usual.

Person_9
Guido! What's McQueen's usual?

Side_12
How should I know?

Person_9
Perfect! Give me two of `em.

Side_5
Quiet! My program's on.

Side_5
Uh-oh...

Side_8
Hey, what's going on over there?

Side_11
Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
there's a crowd.

Side_8
Wait, why do you know his name? And
don't say it like that. It's three
syllables, not ten.

Side_11
What? He's nice to look at. You
know, open-wheeled and all.

Side_8
What's wrong with fenders? I
thought you like my fenders.

Side_8
Mater?

Person_9
Ha ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

Side_8
Those are strong words from a car
that is so fragile.

Side_8
"Not so fast." What is that, your
new motto?

Side_8
Well, I would love to. The only
thing is my crew's off for the
season so ---

Side_12
Pit stop.

Side_8
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!

Side_8
I know, I know. I just got back.
But we won't be long and ---

Side_11
Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
got enough to do here. Mater's
going to have a blast though.
You're bringing Mater, right? You
never bring him to any of your
races.

Side_11
Just let him sit in the pits, give
him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
thrill of a lifetime for him.

Person_9
Your drinks, sir.

Side_8
Mater.

Person_9
I didn't taste it!

Side_8
How'd you like to come and see the
world with me?

Person_9
You mean it?

Side_8
You got me into this thing. You're
coming along.

Side_2
Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
Let's go!

Person_9
You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
that?

Side_8
Mater!

Side_13
Hey, McQueen, over here!

Side_8
Hey, Jeff. Lewis!

Person_9
Hey! You done good! You got all the
leaves!

Side_14
Check out that tow truck.

Side_13
I wonder who that guy's with?

Side_8
Will you guys excuse me just for
one little second?

Side_8
Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
Springs.

Person_9
You're just realizing that? Boy,
that jet-lag really done a number
on you.

Side_8
Mater, look -- things are different
over here. Which means maybe you
should, you know, act a little
different too.

Person_9
Different than what?

Side_8
Well, just... help me out here,
buddy. I ---

Person_9
You need help? Shoot, why didn't
you just say so? That's what a tow
truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
Mr. San Francisco!

Person_9
I'll introduce you.

Side_8
Mater, no.

Person_9
Look at me -- I'm helping you
already!

Person_9
Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
to meet ---

Side_15
Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

Side_8
Nice to meet you, Francesco.

Side_15
Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
very good-looking. Not as good as I
thought, but you're good.

Side_15
Anything for McQueen's friend.

Person_9
Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
sees this. She's Lightning
McQueen's girlfriend.

Side_15
Oooh.

Person_9
She's a big fan of yours.

Side_15
Hey, she has good taste.

Side_8
Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.

Person_9
You're right. She's a huge fan. She
goes on and on about your open
wheels here.

Side_8
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going "on and on."

Side_15
Francesco is familiar with this
reaction to Francesco. Women
respect a car that has nothing to
hide.

Side_8
Yeah, uh...

Side_15
Let us have a toast.

Side_8
Let's.

Side_15
I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
Miss Sally.

Side_8
Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
win tomorrow to her. So if we both
do it, it's really not so special.
Besides, I don't have a drink.

Person_9
I'll go get you one. You mind if I
borrow a few bucks for one of them
drinks?

Side_8
They're free, Mater.

Person_9
Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
here?

Side_8
I should probably go keep an eye on
him. See you at the race.

Side_15
Yes, you will see Francesco. But
not like this.

Side_15
You will see him like this, as he
drives away from you.

Side_8
That's cute. So you had one of
those made up for all the racers?

Side_15
No.

Side_8
Okay.

Side_8
He is so getting beat tomorrow.

Side_16
Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
Axlerod!

Side_17
It is my absolute honor to
introduce to you the competitors in
the first-ever World Grand Prix.
From Brazil. Number eight...

Side_18
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

Person_3
That's because it's air-cooled.

Side_18
I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
have a message from London.

Person_3
Not here.
You must try the canapes on the
mezzanine!

Person_3
So the lab boys analyzed the photo
I sent? What did they learn about
the camera?

Side_18
It appears to be a standard
television camera. They said if you
could get closer photos next time,
that would be great.

Person_3
This was London's message?

Side_18
Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
platforms you were on? Turns out
they're sitting on the biggest oil
reserve in the world.

Person_3
How did we miss that?

Side_18
They'd been scrambling everyone's
satellites. The Americans actually
discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that
platform, under deep cover. He was
able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

Person_3
Who is it? Has anyone seen the
photo yet?

Side_18
No, not yet. The American is here
tonight to pass it to you. He'll
signal you when he's ready.

Person_3
Oh no.

Side_18
What is it?

Person_3
Change of plan. You're meeting the
American.

Side_18
What, me?

Person_3
Those thugs down there were on the
oil platform. If they see me, the
whole mission is compromised.

Side_18
No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
agent.

Person_3
You are now.

Person_9
I'll take one of them.

Person_9
Never know which one McQueen'll
have a hankering for.

Person_9
Hey, what you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

Side_19
No, no. Wasabi.

Person_9
Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
with you? That looks delicious.

Person_9
Uh, a little more, please.
It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more. Come
on, let's go, it's free! You're
getting there... Scoop scoop!

Person_9
There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
ice cream.

Side_19
My condolences.

Side_17
... and now, our last competitor ---
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

Side_8
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
to racing. This is a great
opportunity.

Side_17
Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
Lightning. You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism to
this competition.

Person_9
Somebody get me water!

Person_9
Whatever you do, do not eat the
free pistachio ice cream. It has
turned!

Side_8
Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
Mater.

Side_17
I know him. This is the bloke that
called into the television show.
You're the one I have to thank.

Person_9
No, thank you. This trip's been
amazing.

Side_8
Mater!

Person_9
But wait, I... oh, shoot.

Side_8
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene.

Person_9
But I never leak oil. Never.

Side_8
Go take care of yourself right now.

Person_9
Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
you. I gotta go!

Person_9
Sorry ladies!

Person_9
I never leak I never leak I never
leak...

Person_9
Wowee...

Person_9
What in the---

Side_20
Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's
time for the drop.

Side_18
Oh, you've got to be joking.

Person_3
What's the problem, Shiftwell?

Side_18
He's in the loo.

Person_3
So go in!

Side_18
I can't just go into the men's loo.

Person_3
Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.

Person_9
Whatever you do, I would not go in
there.

Person_9
A Gremlin and a Pacer!

Person_9
No offense to your makes and
models, but you guys break down
harder than my cousin Betsy after
she got left at the ---

Person_9
--- altar!

Person_9
Are you okay?

Side_20
I'm fine.

Person_7
Hey. Tow truck.

Person_7
We'd like to get to our private
business here, if you don't mind.

Person_9
Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the
way of your "private business."
Oh! A little advice: When you hear
her giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.

Person_7
Thank you.

Person_9
It's to adjust the temperature.

Person_8
Got it.

Person_9
Remember it's in Celsius, not
Fahrenheit.

Person_7 AND ACER
Get outta here!

Person_9
Alright then.

Person_9
Excuse me, ma'am.

Person_9
Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin'
to get funky!

Side_18
Hello.

Person_9
Well, hello.

Side_18
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

Person_9
Well of course it doesn't. That's
`cause it's air-cooled!

Person_9
Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the
only ones. Besides the Beetles you
had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with
the pancake motors...

Side_18
Yeah. Okay, I get it---

Person_9
... And before both of them,
there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy
Fillmore's one of them.

Side_18
Listen! We should find somewhere
more private.

Person_9
Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a
little, uh ---

Person_9
Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be
out there at the races.

Side_18
Got it. We'll rendezvous then.

Side_8
There you are. Where have you been?

Person_9
What's a rendezvous?

Side_2
It's like a date.

Person_9
A date?!

Side_8
Mater, what's going on?

Person_9
Well, what's going on is I've got
me a date tomorrow.

Side_2
Guido don't believe you.

Person_9
Well, believe it. My new girlfriend
just said so. Hey, there she is.

Person_9
See ya tomorrow!

Side_2
Guido still don't believe you.

Person_7
--- you tricked us real good.

Person_8
And we don't like being tricked.

Person_8
Hey, what's so funny?

Side_20
Well, you know, I was just wearing
a disguise. You guys are stuck
looking like that.

Side_20
Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
this stuff is good for you.

Person_5
Allinol by itself is good for you.

Person_5
But after microscopic examination,
I have found that it has one small
weakness. When hit with an
electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
extremely dangerous.

Person_7
--- for the camera.

Side_20
Is that all you want? I got a whole
act.

Person_5
You were very interested in this
camera on the oil platform. Now you
will witness what it really does.

Side_20
Whatever you say, Professor.

Person_8
You talked up a lot of cars last
night. Which one's your associate?

Side_20
Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
was your sister. You know, I can't
tell them apart these days.

Person_5
Fifty percent power.
This camera is actually an
electromagnetic pulse emitter.

Person_8
What about her? Did you give it to
her?

Person_5
The Allinol is now heating to a
boil, dramatically expanding,
causing the engine block to crack
under the stress, forcing oil into
the combustion chamber.

Person_8
How about him? You talk to him?

Side_20
What do I care? I can replace an
engine block.

Person_5
You may be able to, but after full
impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.

Person_8
How about him? Does he have it?

Person_5
That's him. He's the one.

Person_7
Roger that, Professor Z.

Side_20
No!

Person_5
The project is still on schedule.
You will find this second agent ---

Person_5
--- and kill him.

Side_22
I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with
racing legends Darrell Cartrip and
David Hobbscap. There's never been
a competition like this before.

Side_23
Really, Darrell, I think you need
to clean your windshield. You're
clearly not seeing this for what it
is: Francesco's race to lose.

Side_15
Really? You are "speed"? Then
Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
really getting him into the zone!

Side_8
He is so getting beat today.

Side_5
His suspension stats look good.

Side_2
Tire pressure is excellent.

Side_4
He's got plenty of fuel.

Person_9
And he's awesome!

Side_18
Why is he in the pits? He's so
exposed.

Person_3
It's his cover. One of the best
I've seen, too. Look at the detail
on that rust. It must have cost him
a fortune.

Side_18
But why hasn't he contacted us yet?

Person_3
There's probably heat on him. Be
patient.

Side_18
Right, of course. He'll signal us
when he can.

Person_3
And then we find out who's behind
all this.

Person_9
McQueen! It's time to make your
move. Get on the outside and show
'em what Doc done taught you.

Side_8
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!

Person_7
Roger that.

Person_7
You gotta be kidding me.

Person_8
What is it?

Person_7
It's that tow truck from the
bathroom.

Person_8
The one from the bathroom?

Person_7
Yeah, the one the American Agent
passed the device to.

Person_8
What about him?

Person_7
What about him? He's in the pits!

Person_8
Not for long.

Side_18
Hold on. I think I've got
something.

Person_3
What is it?

Side_18
The Pacer from the party last
night.

Side_18
Cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks... Yep. His
VIN numbers match.

Person_3
Anyone with him? He won't be alone.

Side_18
Conducting analysis on the target.

Side_18
He's not the only one here.
Three... five... they're
everywhere. And they're all closing
in on... oh no.

Side_18
Finn? Finn, where are you?

Person_9
Wow! Some of them fellers is really
loud.

Person_9
Uh, what?

Side_8
Guys, a little too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

Person_9
Is there gonna be cable where you
is so I can watch the rest of the
race?

Person_9
Well, all right but I usually like
to have a proper detailing done
before I meet a lady friend.

Person_8
Finn McMissile? But you're dead!

Person_3
Then this shouldn't hurt at all.

Person_3
Miss Shiftwell?

Side_18
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages. Multiple
assailants are closing in quickly.

Person_9
Hey, new lady friend? You like
flowers?

Side_8
What?

Person_9
Stay outside. Gotcha.

Side_8
Outside?

Side_15
Grazie and arrivaderci!

Person_8
This time I'm gonna make sure you
stay dead.

Person_9
What's that? You want me to head
toward that ruckus?

Person_9
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

Side_8
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

Person_9
That was cool! Hey, can I get your
autograph?

Person_9
Hey, where'd he go?

Person_9
Dadgum, did I miss our date?

Side_24
Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
your strategy today?

Side_15
Strategia? Francesco needs no
strategy, it's very simple. You
start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then
win. Francesco always wins. It's
boring.

Side_15
To truly crush one's dream, you
must first raise their hopes very
high.

Side_8
Mater.

Person_9
Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
race over? You won, right?

Side_8
Mater, why were you yelling things
at me while I was racing?

Person_9
Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
funny right there. Nah, see that's
`cause I seen these two fellers
doing some sort of karate street
performance. It was nutso. One of
them even had a flamethrower ---

Side_8
A flamethrower? What are you
talking about? I don't understand.
Where were you?

Person_9
Going to meet my date.

Side_8
Your date?

Person_9
She started talking to me as a
voice in my head, telling me where
to go ---

Side_8
What?

Person_9
Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
up, did I?

Side_8
I lost the race because of you!

Person_9
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---

Side_8
An imaginary girlfriend,
flamethrowers. This is exactly why
I don't bring you along to these
things.

Person_9
Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
somebody and explained what
happened I could help.

Side_8
I don't need your help. I don't
want your help.

Side_25
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah, what happened?

Side_8
I made a mistake. But I can assure
you, it won't happen again.

Side_8
Look, guys. We know what the
problem is and we've taken care of
it.

Side_22
Lightning McQueen loses in the last
lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
first race of the World Grand Prix
and three, count em, three cars
flamed out leading some to suggest
that their fuel, Allinol, might be
to blame.

Side_17
Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
is safe! There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out!

Side_24
Well the jury may still be out on
whether Allinol caused these
accidents, but one thing's for
sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
race.

Side_22
Team McQueen can't be happy right
now.

Side_26
Come with me please, sir.

Person_9
But I'm gonna miss my plane.

Side_26
Right this way.

Person_9
Doggone it. This is about my hook,
isn't it? I know I should've
checked it, but I can't really,
look -- it's attached to me.

Person_9
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

Person_3
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British
Intelligence.

Person_9
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

Person_3
Who are you with? FBI, CIA?

Person_9
Let's just say I'm triple-A
affiliated. You know, I know some
karate. I don't wanna brag or
nothing, but I've got me a black
fan belt.

Person_9
Hey, you wanna see some moves I
made up?

Person_3
You're being followed.

Person_9
This first one I can reach into a
car's hood, pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he
stalls. I call it, "What I
accidentally did to my friend Luigi
once."

Person_7
There he is!

Person_9
Look, I probably ought to go. I'm
about to miss my flight.

Person_3
Don't worry.

Person_3
I've taken care of that. Hang on.

Person_9
This is First Class service. You
don't even have to go through the
terminal.

Person_3
Drive forward. Whatever you do,
don't stop.

Person_9
Is everything okay back there?

Person_3
Roger that.

Person_9
I knew I should've done carry-on!

Person_9
Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary
girlfriend!

Side_18
Come on! Get in here!

Person_3
Hold on, Sid!

Side_27
Finn, it's now or never!

Side_27
Hold on!

Side_8
"I'm so sorry for what I did. I
don't want to be the cause of you
losing any more races. I want you
to go prove to the world what I
already know - that you are the
greatest race car in the whole wide
world. Your best friend, Mater."

Side_8
I didn't really want him to leave.

Side_2
Side_28
Wait, there's more here.
"P.S. Please tell the hotel I
didn't mean to order that movie. I
thought it was just a preview and I
didn't realize I was paying for it.
P.P.S... That's funny right there --
There's a few more pages of P.S.'s
here.

Person_3
Now that's how I like to start the
day! You never feel more alive than
when you're almost dead.

Person_9
That's the closest I ever been to
missing my flight! That was ---

Side_18
Still in one piece, great.

Person_9
I gotta go to a doctor. I keep
getting these sharp pains in my
undercarriage.

Side_18
Downloading the photo now.

Person_9
Hey, lemme introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomething-or-
other. He's a First Class VIP
airport whatchamacallit. And Finn,
this here's my date.
I never did get your name.

Side_18
Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

Person_3
Finally. Time to see who's behind
all this.

Side_18
What is this?

Person_9
Well, that's one of the worst
engines ever made. It's an old
aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what. Them ain't metric,
they ain't inches...

Side_18
Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is
this, Mater?

Person_9
Well, it's kinda hard to tell from
this picture, ain't it?

Side_18
But you're the one who took it.

Person_3
Holley.

Side_18
Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good
agent gets what he can, then gets
out before he's killed." Sorry.

Person_9
Agent? You mean like insurance
agent, like,
`Like a good neighbor, Mater is
there'? Wait, you mean secret
agents. You guys is spies!

Person_3
Holley, in how many makes and
models did this type of engine
appear?

Side_18
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period. At least
35,000 cars were made with this
engine.

Person_9
You're pretty.

Person_9
And so nice.

Side_18
Just pay attention.

Person_3
This seems like a dead end. If
there were something in the photo
that could narrow this down a bit
I'd be a lot happier.

Person_9
You might not be happy, but I bet
this feller is. See how he's had
most of his parts replaced? And see
all them boxes over there? Them's
all original parts. They ain't easy
to come by.

Side_18
Rare parts.

Person_3
That's something we can track.

Side_18
Exactly!

Person_3
Well done, Mater! I would never
have seen that.
I know of a black-market parts
dealer in Paris, a treacherous
lowlife. But, he's the only car in
the world who can tell us whose
engine this is. Mater, what would
you say to setting up an informal
task force on this one?

Person_9
Wait, what?

Person_3
You obviously have plenty of
experience in the field.

Person_9
Well yeah I live right next to one.
I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly
been much help to anybody recently.

Person_3
You're helping me. Please, Mater.

Person_9
Well, okay. But you know I'm just a
tow truck, right?

Person_3
Right. And I'm just in the
import/export business. Siddeley?

Side_27
Yes, Finn?

Person_3
Paris. Tout de suite.

Person_9
Yeah, two of them sweets for me
too, Sid!
You know, I always wanted to be a
spy.

Side_27
Afterburners, sir?

Person_3
Is there any other way?

Side_18
No VIN scans. Got it.

Person_3
Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at
anyone. And absolutely, positively
no idling. Are we clear?

Side_18
Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.

Person_3
Mater?

Person_9
Yeah, Finn?

Person_3
We're not here to go shopping.

Person_9
Shopping? What do you mean? Why
would I ---

Person_9
Dadgum.

Side_29
- Parts for sale, Monsieur!
- Monsieur! Parts for sale!

Person_9
You gotta be kidding me - they've
got everything here. Look at them
hoods! I could use a hood.

Person_9
Sorry fellers, I gotta go.

Person_9
Excuse me. What are you selling?

Person_3
There you are.

Person_9
Man, there are some great ---

Person_3
Mater, get back!

Person_9
Hey, wait for me!

Side_18
But I thought ---

Person_3
Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
him up.

Person_9
Sure thing.

Side_30
You rusty piece of junk, get your
dirty hook off me!

Person_3
Allez! Maintenant - vite!

Person_3
Easy, Tomber. This is her first
field assignment - she didn't know
you were my informant.

Side_18
Informant?

Side_30
A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
smell.

Person_3
Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
Moroccan impound the first time I
saved him, if I recall correctly.

Side_30
Speaking of recalls, you're getting
up there in mileage aren't you,
Finn?

Side_18
Alright, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old. So.

Side_18
There you go, informant. Inform us.

Side_30
That is the worst motor ever made.

Side_30
Wait. That oil filter... those
wheel bearings.

Person_3
Do those parts look familiar,
Tomber?

Side_30
They should. I sold them.

Side_18
To whom?

Side_30
No idea. He's my best customer, but
he always does his business over
the phone. I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts. Now I
know.

Person_9
Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
nothing truer than that.

Person_3
"Lemon?"

Person_9
Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
ever work right. Lemons is a tow
truck's bread and butter. Like them
Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
the party and the race and the
airport.

Person_3
Holley, pull up the pictures from
the oil platform. I want to know
what other type of cars were out
there.

Side_18
Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
And Trunkovs.

Person_3
Mater, are these cars considered
lemons?

Person_9
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

Side_18
Finn. Everyone involved in this
plot is one of history's biggest
loser cars.

Person_3
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

Side_30
This explains it!

Person_3
What, Tomber?

Side_30
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
never get together. But they're
having a secret meeting in two
days.

Person_3
Where's this meeting taking place?

Side_30
Porto Corsa, Italy.

Person_9
That's where the next race is!

Person_3
Then there's a good chance our
mystery engine will be there too.

Side_30
Your chances are more than good. I
just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday... to Porto Corsa.

Person_3
Holley, contact Stephenson and have
him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good
work.

Person_9
You never see this many lemons in
one town. Unless there's a swap
meet, or something.

Person_9
Hey, how'd you get all them
pictures?

Side_18
Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto
Corsa's red light cameras to do
recognition scans.

Person_9
Wow, not only is you the prettiest
car I ever met, but you the
smartest too.

Side_18
Thank you. I think.

Person_9
That's a familiar sight.

Person_9
A Hugo being towed. But he looks
absolutely perfect.

Person_3
Of course. They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

Person_9
Makes sense. If I was rich and
broke down every day, I'd hire me
to tow me around all the time too.

Person_3
We've got to infiltrate that
meeting. It's the only way to find
out who's behind all this.

Person_9
What?

Side_18
Hold still.

Person_9
Ahh!

Person_3
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

Side_18
Thank you, Finn.

Person_9
Boy, I sure wish my friends could
see me now.

Side_2
Guido, your eyes do not deceive
you. We are in Italy. We are home!

Side_4
Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel,
man?

Side_2
What? No friends of mine will stay
in a hotel in my village. You will
stay with my --- Uncle Topolino!

Side_5
How do they do it? These are the
same ingredients as back home, but
it tastes so good.

Side_4
It's organic, man.

Side_5
Tree hugger.

Side_31
You look so down, so low. Is like
you have flat tires.

Side_31
She said you look like you're
starving. That she's going to make
you a big meal, and fatten you up.

Side_8
No, Mama Topolino, please. You
don't need to make a fuss!

Side_31
Capisco. I understand. Is a
problem, yes? Between you and a
friend?

Side_8
How'd you know that?

Side_31
A wise car hears one word and
understands two.

Side_31
That, and Luigi told me. While Mama
cooks, come and take a stroll with
me.

Side_8
I brought my friend Mater along on
the trip. And I told him he needed
to act different, that we weren't
in Radiator Springs.

Side_31
This Mater. He's a close friend?

Side_8
He's my best friend.

Side_31
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

Side_8
What did I do? I said some things
during our fight...

Side_31
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me, they would
fight over everything.

Side_31
They fight over what Ferrari was
the best Ferrari; which one of
them look more like a Ferrari...
There were even some non-Ferrari
fights.

Side_31
So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
to fight. Everybody fights now and
then, especially best friends.

Side_31
But you gotta make up fast.

Side_31
No fight more important than
friendship.

Side_31
Chi trova un'amico, trova un
tesoro.

Side_8
What does that mean?

Side_32
Now, mangia! Eat!

Side_33
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

Person_3
Thank you, Stephenson.

Side_18
That should just about do it.

Person_3
Perfect.

Side_18
So Mater, it's voice-activated. But
you know, everything's voice-
activated these days.

Person_9
What? I thought you was supposed to
be making me a disguise.

Person_9'S COMPUTER
Voice recognized. Disguise Program
Initiated.

Person_9
Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a
German truck!

Person_9'S COMPUTER

Person_9
Check it out. I'm wearing
Materhosen. Make me a monster
truck!

Person_9'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

Person_9'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

Person_9
A funny car!

Person_9'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

Person_3
The idea is to keep a low profile,
Mater.

Person_9
So I just go in, pretend to be this
truck.

Person_3
And leave the rest to us.

Side_18
Now hold still.

Side_18
I have to do the final fitting on
your disguise.

Side_18
Oh dear. That's no good.

Person_9
Hey, what are you doing?

Side_18
The disguise won't calibrate
effectively without a smooth
surface to graft onto.

Person_9
Oh. For a second there I thought
you was trying to fix my dents.

Side_18
I was.

Person_9
Well then no thank you. I don't get
them dents buffed, pulled, filled
or painted by nobody. They're way
too valuable.

Side_18
Your dents are valuable?

Person_9
I come by each one of them with my
best friend Lightning McQueen.

Person_9
I don't fix these. I want to
remember these dents forever.

Side_18
So you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your
cover?

Person_3
Friendships can be dangerous in our
line of work, Mater.

Person_9
But my line of work is towing and
salvage.

Person_3
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is
designing iPhone apps.

Person_9
No, I meant for real. I ---

Side_18
It's okay. Say no more. I'll work
around the dent.

Person_3
In the meantime...

Person_3
You look a little light on weapons.

Side_22
The big news continues to be
Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to
the press earlier today to answer
questions about its safety.

Side_17
An independent panel of scientists
has determined that Allinol is
completely safe. Okay? Safe! There
it is.

Side_22
So the race will go on, folks.

Side_24
But the question everyone is
asking: Will the real Lightning
McQueen show up today?

Side_15
Bellissima! Thank you for your
support.
And your big mistake, McQueen!

Side_2
McQueen? Is everything okay?

Side_4
If you're worried about your fuel,
man, don't. It's perfectly safe.

Side_8
No, guys, I just really wish Mater
were here.

Side_8
Oh, great. Here it comes. What've
you got, Francesco?

Side_15
For famous race cars like Francesco
and well... you, to be far away
from home is not easy.

Side_8
I think you forgot the insulting
part of that insult.

Side_15
Is no insult. When Francesco is
away from home, he misses his mama
just like you miss your tow truck
amico.

Side_8
Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because
that's exactly how I ---

Side_15
Of course, I am at home. And my
mama is right here.

Side_15
McQueen is very sad! I will beat
his cry-baby bottom today!

Side_8
And there's the insult we were
missing. Grazie!

Side_35
Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly
cars. Look like someone stole their
trunks.

Side_18
Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!

Side_18
Mio nonno, my grandfather, has
broken down. If one of you would
help I would be so thankful.

Side_36
Sounds like you need some "roadside
assistance".

Side_37
She was talking to me, Ivan.

Side_36
Oh really? Prove it.

Side_18
No, no, don't fight over me.

Side_18
Signore Tow Truck, per favore?

Person_3
You're on any moment now.

Person_9
I don't know about this, Finn.
What if I screw things up?

Person_9
It's just that them guys look
pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
say "idiot"? Is that how you see
me?

Side_18
Why aren't you in disguise?

Person_9
I, uh---

Side_18
Come on, there's no time. Go!

Person_9
Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.

Person_9'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

Side_35
It's the boss! He is coming!

Side_38
Ivan!

Side_38
Ivan, why do you insult me so by
making me wait?

Side_18
He's in.

Side_39
Air Freshener, antenna balls,
sparkplugs...

Person_9
Why is that? What do you mean don't
talk to you?
(more talking from Holley
which we cannot hear)
So you want me to stop talking to
you. Right now?

Side_35
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

Person_9
I have no idea what you're talking
about...

Person_9
...Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop
Alex."

Person_9
Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But I guess that makes sense
seeings how you's wanted in France,
Germany, the Czech Republic...

Side_18
Side_40
(cutting in to his
Mater! Stop it!

Side_35
Okay, okay. Keep your voice down.
You're gonna make me arrested.
Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in
a bad mood.

Person_3
He's so good.

Side_41
Victor!

Side_42
Hey, Victor!

Side_43
There you are.

Side_41
Come in, come in.

Side_43
Victor Hugo. I'm J. Curby Gremlin,
from Detroit. It's good to see you.
Now we can start.

Side_38
Is the big boss here yet?

Side_41
No, not yet.

Side_42
He's supposed to be here any
minute.

Person_3
Here we go.

Person_5
Guten Tag!

Side_42
It's just the Professor.

Side_38
Zundapp, when is he coming?

Person_5
He's already here.

Side_16
Welcome, everyone.

Side_44
I wish I could be with you on this
very special day but... my clutch
assembly broke. You know how it is.

Side_42
Been there.

Side_43
Forget about it.

Side_41
We know how you feel.

Person_3
Descramble that voice!

Side_18
I'm trying... It's too
sophisticated!

Side_44
We are here to celebrate. Today all
your hard work pays off. The world
turned their backs on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts. The only
thing they haven't stopped doing is
laughing at us. They've called us
terrible names...

Side_44
Jalopy. Rustbucket.

Side_44
Heap. Clunker.

Side_44
Junker, beater, wreck.

Side_44
Rattletrap.

Side_44
Lemon. But their insults just give
us strength. Because today, my
friends...

Side_44
...that all ends.

Person_3
What just happened?

Side_18
I'm working on it.

Side_44
They laughed at us. But now it's
our turn to laugh back.

Person_3
Holley?

Side_18
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

Side_18
Finn, it's the camera!

Person_3
Where?

Side_18
On the tower.

Side_44
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve, will
become the most powerful cars in
the world!

Person_3
Get out of the way! Andate!

Side_44
They will come to us and they will
have no choice, `cause they will
need us.

Person_3
No!

Side_44
Long live Lemons!

Side_18
Finn.

Side_8
Yeah!

Side_15
Dah! This is impossible!

Side_8
That's what I'm talking about.
Kachow! Hey, where are all the
other cars?

Side_15
What is going on?

Side_22
Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in
London still going to take place?

Side_43
I can't believe this is really
happening.

Side_41
Shh, quiet!

Side_41
Here it comes.

Person_5
A toast! To the death of Allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

Side_18
Mater. Abort the mission. They've
got Finn. Get out of there. Get out
of there right now!

Side_36
How is your grandfather?

Side_35
Isn't this a great party, Ivan?

Person_9
Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.

Side_35
You are not leaving, are you?

Person_9
Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.

Person_9
McQueen?

Side_45
- What?! - Did he just say
Allinol? After today?

Person_5
Yes, sir. Of course.

Person_5
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed.

Person_9
No!

Person_5
It's the American spy!

Right this way, signore.

Side_8
Mater?

Person_9

Side_8
That really sounded like Mater.
Mater?

Person_9
McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!

Side_8
Mater?!

Side_8
Excuse me.

Side_25 LIAISON
No, no, where are you going?
Please, Mr. McQueen!

Side_8
Scusi. Mater! Scusi...

Side_8
Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
so sorr ---

Side_36
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.

Side_36
Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
killed out there today." You're
the best.

Side_8
What? Oh. I mean, thanks.

Side_25 LIAISON
Right this way, signore ---

Side_8
I really thought I heard my friend.

Side_8
Wait, what?

Side_25 LIAISON
Please, the world press is waiting.
You come with me, please.

Person_9
Let me go!

Person_5
You actually care about that race
car. A pity you didn't warn him in
time.

Person_9
Domo arigato!

Person_9
You done good! You got all the
leaves!

Side_14
Check out that tow truck.

Side_13
I wonder who that guy's with?

Person_9
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

Person_9
I never leak oil. Never.

Side_8
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene!

Person_9
Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
up, did I?

Side_8
I lost the race because of you!

Person_9
Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---

Side_8
I don't need your help. I don't
want your help!

Person_9
Bang a gong, get it on!

Side_8
Listen, this isn't Radiator
Springs. This is exactly why I
don't bring you along to these
things!

Person_9
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

Person_3
We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
Bentley.

Person_9
Woaaaah! ---

Person_9
This... this is all my fault.

Person_3
Don't be a fool, Mater.

Person_9
But I am, remember? You said so.

Person_3
When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
complimenting you on what a good
spy you are.

Person_9
I'm not a spy!

Person_9
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time. I really am just a
tow truck.

Side_18
Finn, he's not joking.

Person_3
I know.

Person_9
You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen is
`cause I'm such a big one. This is
all my fault.

Person_7
Good, you're up!

Person_8
And just in time!

Person_7
Professor Z wanted you to have a
front row seat for the death of
Lightning McQueen.

Person_8
Not for much longer.

Side_8
I called to talk to Mater. It never
occurred to me that he wouldn't be
there.

Side_9
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard
right now.

Side_3
And Sarge is in touch with his
friends in the British military.

Side_11
You just need to focus on the race.

Side_8
I know, but Sal, with everything
going on I'm not sure I should---

Side_8
Sir Axlerod.

Side_17
I'm sorry to interrupt.

Side_8
No, no, it's all right.

Side_17
I just wanted to come down here and
personally thank you. Because after
Italy, I was finished. And then you
gave me one last shot.

Side_8
Listen, I ---

Side_17
And I probably shouldn't be saying
this at all but... I hope you win
today. Show the world that they've
been wrong about Allinol.

Side_11
Mater would want you to race.

Side_8
All right. For Mater.

Person_7
Here he comes!

Person_7
I don't know, Professor.

Person_8
What did you do?

Person_8
You broke it.

Person_7
Quiet!
I understand, sir. Yes.

Person_8
What'd he say?

Person_7
We go to the backup plan.

Person_9
Backup plan??

Person_7
We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!

Person_8
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow," he's
gonna go "ka-boom"!

Person_7
Don't feel bad, tow truck. You
couldn't have saved him.

Person_8
Oh, wait. You could have!

Person_9
Dadgum lemons.

Person_7
What, you didn't think we'd take
your bullets?

Person_8
That's right! You got nothin'.

Person_7
Who's the lemon now, huh?

Person_3
Nice try, Mater.

Person_9
Dadgum!

Person_9
Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!

Side_18
Mater!

Person_9
I gotta get you all out of there!

Person_3
There's no time. McQueen needs your
help, Mater.

Person_9
But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.

Person_3
It's up to you. Go to the pits and
get everyone out. You can do that.

Person_9
What about you guys?

Person_3
We'll be okay.

Side_18
Go and get some more dents, Mater.

Side_18
So we'll be "okay"? Really?

Person_3
He wouldn't have left if I'd told
him the truth.
Being killed by a clock. Gives a
whole new meaning to "your time has
come."

Side_18
Time. That's it!

Person_3
What are you doing?

Side_18
Trying to turn back time. If I can
just reverse the polarity...

Person_3
Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!

Person_9
What's everybody on the wrong side
of the road for?!

Side_18
Oh no!

Person_3
Drive!

Person_3
Burn rubber!!

Person_3
We've got to get to the course.
Calculate the fastest way to ---

Side_18

Side_18
They're standard issue now.

Person_3
You kids get all the good hardware.

Side_18
Oh no. That's Mater's.

Person_3
I knew his escape was too easy.

Side_2
Mater!

Person_9
Everybody get out! Get out now!
Y'all gotta get out the pits!

Person_9
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

Side_11
We're here because of you, Mater.

Side_3
Is everything okay?

Person_9
No! Everything's not okay! There's
a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get
out! Now!

Side_48
- A bomb? - Huh? - Woah.

Person_3
Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on
you.

Person_3
They knew you'd try to help
McQueen. When we were knocked out
they planted it in your air filter.

Person_9
Uh-oh.

Side_8
Mater! There you are!

Person_9
Stop right there!

Side_8
Oh man, I've been so worried about
you!

Person_9
Don't come any closer!

Side_8
Are you okay?

Person_9
No, I'm not okay. Stay away from
me!!

Side_8
No, wait. Wait!

Side_8
Mater, wait!

Side_8
Mater, wait!

Person_9
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you gonna get hurt real bad!

Side_8
I know I made you feel that way
before, but none of that matters
because we're best friends!

Person_9
McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the
bomb!

Side_8
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here.
You've always been the bomb! And
you'll always be the bomb.

Person_9
Stay away!

Side_8
No! Never!

Side_41
Get McQueen!!

Person_3
Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help
Mater.

Side_18
Got it!

Side_15
What is happening?!

Person_4
Hurry, Professor!

Person_3
Do you really think I'm going to
let you float away, Professor?

Person_9
McQueen, let go!

Side_8
Never!

Person_5
Give it up, McMissile!

Side_18
Mater, stop!

Person_9
No way! You could get hurt!

Side_18
Oh no.

Side_18
Mater, we've got to get that bomb
off you.

Side_8
Bomb?

Person_9
Yeah, they strapped it to me to
kill you as a back-up plan.

Side_8
Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb
on you?

Side_8
Death ray?

Person_3
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!

You blow up.

It's nothing personal.

Person_9
Fellers, listen.

Person_9
I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me my
whole life too ---

Person_9
--- but becoming powerful and rich
beyond your wildest dreams ain't
gonna make you feel better.

Side_43
Yeah, but it's worth a shot.

Side_12
Pit stop.

Side_6
Not today, boys!

Side_42
Retreat!

Side_5
Thanks for the help, Corporal.

Side_50
Anything for one of pop's mates.

Side_8
What's he saying?! What's wrong!?

Side_2
None of his wrenches fit the bolts!

Person_9
I get it. I get it! I know what
needs to be done.

Side_8
Then do it!

Person_9
What? No, I can't do it. Look,
nobody takes me seriously. I know
that now. This ain't Radiator
Springs.

Side_8
Yes it is.

Side_8
You're yourself in Radiator
Springs. Be yourself here. And if
people aren't taking you seriously,
then they need to change. Not you.
I know that, because I was wrong
before. Now you can do this. You're
the bomb.

Person_9
Thanks, buddy.

Side_8
No no no, you're the actual bomb.
Now let's go!

Person_9
Oh, right! Hang on!

Person_3
Where's he going?

Side_51'S GUARD
Back up! Back away!

Side_51'S GUARDS
Get back!

Side_8
No, no, it's okay! Tell them,
Mater. Explain.

Person_9
Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging
the racers and hurting the cars and
I know who. Oh wait... Your
Majesty.

Side_51'S GUARDS
- Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody
down! - Look out!

Person_3
Mater, I don't know what you're
doing but stand down now!

Person_9
This ain't nothing at all like
Radiator Springs.

Side_8
Mater, just cut to the chase!

Person_9
Okay.

Person_9
It's him.

Side_17
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

Person_9
I figured it out when I realized
you all attached this ticking time
bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
bolts that hold together that old
British engine from the photograph.
Holley! Show that picture.

Side_18
O-kay...

Person_9
And then I remembered what they say
about old British engines - "If
there ain't no oil under `em, there
ain't no oil in `em."

Side_17
What is he talking about?

Person_9
It was you leaking oil at the party
in Japan. You just blamed it on me.

Side_17
Electric cars don't use oil, you
twit.

Person_9
Then you're faking it. You didn't
convert to no electric. We pop that
hood we gonna see that engine from
that picture right there.

Side_17
This lorry's crazy. He's going to
kill us all!

Side_17
Stay away!

Side_18
But Sir Axlerod created the race,
Mater. Why would he want to hurt
anyone?

Person_9
To make Allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil. I
mean, he said it himself with that
disguised voice.

Side_17
"Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you
are!

Side_54
This is going nowhere fast. We
really should go, Grandmother.

Side_51
One moment. I'd like to see where
this is going.

Person_3
Mater, he created Allinol.

Person_9
Yeah, but what if he found that
huge oil field just as the world
was trying to find something else?

Person_9
What if he came up with Allinol
just to make alternative fuel look
bad?

Side_17
"What if?" You're basing this on a
"What if"?!

Side_55
Okay, that's it.

Side_17
Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
crazy!

Side_17
Keep away, you idiot!

Person_3
Mater!

Side_18
Mater!

Side_17
Someone do something!

Side_17
You're insane, you are!
Deactivate!!

Side_56
Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
Sir Axlerod.

Person_3
The engine from the photo.

Side_18
It's a perfect match!

Side_17
How did the tow truck figure it
out?

Person_9
Now you're talking!

Side_8
Mater, let's go. You're on.

Side_57
Your Majesty. May I present for the
investiture of honorary Knighthood
of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
Radiator Springs.

Side_8
Go get `em, buddy.

Side_51
I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."

Person_9
McMissile, McQueen. Queen?
McMissile.

Person_9
So there I was: rocket jets going
full blast, McQueen hanging on for
dear life when suddenly them two
nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
guns drawed. We was goners. But
then out of nowhere, this beautiful
spy car swoops in from the sky to
save us!

Side_58
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

Side_59
Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
spy cars?

Side_18
No, you're quite right. It does
sound a bit far-fetched.

Person_9
Holley! Finn!

Side_18
Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see
you again.

Person_9
What're you doing here?

Person_3
Our satellites picked up an urgent
communique.

Side_2
So you got my e-mail.

Person_9
Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a
great time. Everybody! This here's
Finn McMissile. He's a secret
agent.
Don't tell nobody. And this is
Holley Shiftwell. She's ---

Side_18
I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so
nice to meet you all.

Side_59
Was that from when you swooped in
and saved them in London?

Side_58
Van!

Side_59
What? I'm just asking.

Side_9
Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just
let me go get my tools.

Side_18
Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

Side_7
A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as
crazy as Mater.

Side_10
Those two are perfect for each
other.

Side_8
You know, there's one thing I still
don't get. The bad guys hit me with
the beam from the camera, right? So
why didn't I, you know...

Person_9
Explode in a fiery inferno?

Side_8
Yeah.

Person_3
We couldn't figure that one out
either.

Side_18
Our investigation proved that
Allinol was actually gasoline. And
Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
when it got hit by the beam it
would explode.

Side_8
Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
my fuel was safe.

Side_4
If you're implying that I switched
out that rotgut excuse for
alternative fuel with my all-
natural, sustainable, organic
biofuel just because I never
trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong,
man.
It was him.

Side_5
Once Big Oil, always Big Oil. Man.

Side_4
Tree hugger.

Side_6
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is
about to begin! All spectators
clear the starting line!

Side_13
Man, I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked.

Side_14
Yeah, we should do this every year.

Side_8
I just figured, we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.
Plus: no press, no trophy. Just
racing - the way I like it.

Side_15
Francesco likes it like this too.

Side_8
Francesco. I'd like you to meet ---

Side_15
Signorina Sally. It is official:
Lightning McQueen is the luckiest
car in the world.

Side_15
Which he will have to be to have a
chance against Francesco today.

Side_15
See you at the finish line, Mc---

Side_15
What is that?

Side_8
It's just something I had made up
for the occasion.

Side_15
Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
was funnier when I did it, but
it's very funny. What are you going
to do next? Are you going to take
off your fenders? Try it. You'll
like it.

Side_11
So he's not so good-looking.

Side_8
Yeah. Nice try.

Side_11
I'm serious.

Side_8
That's why I love you, Sally.
Wish me luck.

Side_11
You don't need it!

Side_3
Mmm-mmm. That Francesco is fine-
looking.

Side_11
And those open wheels.

Side_3
I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

Person_9
Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!

Side_18
Finn, time to go. Siddeley's
gassed, geared and ready to fly.

Person_9
You're leaving already?

Person_3
We've got another mission, Mater.
Just stopped by here to "pick
something up."

Person_9
Something tells me you're not
talking about souvenir bumper
stickers.

Person_3
Her Majesty asked for you
personally, Mater.

Person_9
But I told you all before. I'm not
a spy.

Side_18
We know.

Person_3
Spy or not, you're still the
smartest, most honest chap we've
ever met.

Side_18
Don't forget massively charming.

Person_9
Well, thanks. But as much fun as it
was hanging with y'all, this...

Person_9
This is home.

Side_18
That's alright, we understand. But
I'll be back. You still owe me that
first date.

Person_3
If there's ever anything I can do
for you, just let me know.

Person_9
Well, I sure appreciate that, thank
you.
Actually... there is one thing.

Person_9
Whoo-hoo!!!

Side_1
Whoa!!!

Side_15
Impossible!

Side_8
Mater!?

Side_8
I'll see you at the finish line,
buddy!

Person_9
Not if I see you first!

Person_1
Three weeks and we're still no
closer to cracking this?

Person_1
Right... bring him in.

Person_2
This is the best party EVER!!!

Person_3
Haha!   Yeah!

Person_2
Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

Person_4
Fear not, for here come the gallant
knights to save us!

Person_5
No, no, no! What do you mean she's
not coming?! I have a backyard
full of these little girls who are
counting on a visit from a fairy
princess!

Person_5
Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

Person_5
Listen! I don't want a refund! I
want a fairy princess... please!
Please, I am begging you.
You know what? I hope that you can
sleep at night, you crusher of
little girls' dreams!!!

Person_2
Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
coming?

Person_5
Any minute now!

Person_2
Yayyy!

Person_5
Stall them.

Person_4
Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
That's enough of the magic show!

Person_6
Awwww.

Person_4
Wait, did you hear that? It
sounded like the twinkling sounds
of magical fairy dust.

Person_2
It's the fairy princess!   She's
coming!

Person_4
Look!

Person_5
Aaaaaahh!

Person_5
It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
most magical fairy princess of all!
And I am here to wish Princess
Agnes a very happy birthday!

Person_7
How come you're tho fat?

Person_5
Because my house is made of candy
and sometimes I eat instead of
facing my problems.

Person_7
How come you have-

Person_5
Okay!   Time for cake!

Person_2
Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
the best fairy princess ever!

Person_5
You are welcome, little girl.

Person_2
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
just pretending for the other kids.

Person_8
Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
Party!

Person_5
Hello, Jillian.

Person_8
Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
here, but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and...

Person_5
No, no, no, get off of the limb
right now. No limb.

Person_8
Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
sings karaoke, she has a lot of
free time, looks aren't that
important to her...

Person_5
No, Jill's, that is not happening.
Seriously. I'm fine.

Person_8
Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
about my cousin Linda?

Person_5
No.

Person_8
Oh, oh! I know someone whose
husband just died!

Person_5
I'm sorry.     I did not see you
there.

Person_5
Or there.

Person_5
Kyle... Kyle!

Person_5
Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
business on the petunias!

Person_5
There you go. Those are Fred's.
Go crazy.

Person_5
Good boy.

Person_5
Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

Person_9
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
(realizes her badge is
upside down)
Oh. Whoops.
(clears her throat, all
business)
Sorry, you're gonna have to come
with me.

Person_5
Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!

Person_9
You know you really should announce
your weapons after you fire them,
Mr. Gru. For example--

Person_9
Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
good.

Person_9
Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

Person_9
Oh...sorry!

Person_9
Get...in...there...you...big...man!

Side_1
Boss!

Side_2
Koom ey lah!

Side_3
Koom ey lah! Koom ey lah!

Side_3
Aaaaaaiiieeeaaaiiieeeaaaah!

Side_3
Woooo!

Side_2
Ooooh!

Side_3
Quack quack!

Side_1
Hi-YAH!!

Side_4
What the--     Oh!

Person_6
Whoa...

Person_5
Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh,
foot's asleep...ah...pins and
needles...

Person_5
Ehhh...

Person_1
I apologize for our methods in
getting you here.

Person_9
I don't. I'd do it again in a
heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I
enjoyed that. Every second of it.
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

Person_1
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

Person_9
Sorry, sir.

Person_5
Okay, this is bogus!

Person_5
I don't know who you people think
you are, but--

Person_1
We are the Anti-Villain League.

Person_1
An ultra-secret organization
dedicated to fighting crime on a
global scale. Rob a bank? We're
not interested. Kill someone? Not
our deal. But you want to melt the
polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt.
Fuji? Or even steal the moon?
Then we notice.

Person_5
First of all, you've got no proof
that I did that. Second, after I
did do that, I put it back!

Person_1
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
That's why we've brought you here.
I am the League's director, Silas
Ramsbottom.

Side_2
Bottom.

Side_1
Heeheheeeeheeehee.

Person_1
Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...

Person_9
Oh, me now...?

Person_9
Um, recently an entire top secret
lab disappeared from the Arctic
Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.
Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where
did it go?

Person_5
I don't care.

Person_9
The lab was devoted to experiments
involving PX-41, a transmutation
serum. What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

Side_1
Aaah!

Person_5
Oh!

Person_5
Hmm, you usually don't see that in
bunnies.

Person_1
As you can see, in the wrong hands,
the PX-41 serum could be the most
devastating weapon on earth.
(struggles to get through
the opening in the table)
Fortunately it has a very distinct
chemical footprint, and using the
latest chemtracking technology, we
found traces of it in the Paradise
Mall.

Person_5
Ha!   A mall?

Person_1
Precisely. And we believe that one
of these shop owners is a master
criminal.

Person_1
And that's where you come in. As
an ex-villain, you know how a
villain thinks, how a villain acts.

Person_9
The plan is to set you up
undercover at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully you'll be able to--

Person_5
Okay, I see where this is going,
with all the Mission Impossible
stuff, but no. No! I am a father
now. And a legitimate businessman.
I am developing a line of delicious
jams and jellies.

Person_1
Jams and...jellies?

Person_5
Oh, attitude! That's right! So
thanks, but no thanks.
And here's a tip--instead of tasing
people and kidnapping them, maybe
you should just give them a call!
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

Person_1
Ramsbottom.

Person_5
Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

Person_9
Look, I probably shouldn't be
saying this, but your work as a
villain was kind of amazing, so if
you ever want to get back to doing
something awesome--give us a call.

Side_2
Mack-oh! Mack-oh!    Mack-oh!

Person_5
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.

Person_4
Oh, sorry.

Person_3
So when ya goin' on your date?

Person_5
What?

Person_3
Remember? Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

Person_5
Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And
I'm not going on any date.

Person_3
Why not?    Are you scared?

Side_5
Hey, did you guys see the moon
landing on TV?

Side_6
Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so
cool...

Side_5
Yeah, and you know what--

Side_7
Excuse me, Lisa?

Side_5
I was talking to Billy the other
day.

Side_6
No way.

Side_5
He is so cute.

Side_5
And I think he likes me.

Person_5
Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--

Side_8
Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru
touched Lisa!

Side_6
Eeeeewww!

Side_9
Lisa's got Grooties!

Person_5
Scared? Of what? Women?! No,
that's bonkers! I just-- I have no
interest in going on a date, that's
all. Case closed. I'm not scared--
of women... or dates... let's go to
bed.

Person_5
Goodnight, Edith.

Person_5
Goodnight, Margo.

Person_5
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold
the horses. Who are you texting?

Person_4
No one.   Just my friend Avery.

Person_5
Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's
name or a boy's name?

Person_4
Does it matter?

Person_5
No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless
it's a boy!

Person_2
I know what makes you a boy.

Person_5
Uh...oooh...you...do?

Person_2
Your bald head.

Person_5
Oh, yes...

Person_2
It's really smooth. Sometimes I
stare at it and imagine a little
chick popping out. Peep peep peep.

Person_5
Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

Side_10
Hey, oh!    Me banana!

Person_5
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

Person_5
Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's
almost Friday.

Person_5
So, how's today's batch, Dr.
Nefario?

Side_11
I developed a    new formula which
allowed me to    get every known kind
of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

Person_5
That tastes good...
Love the flavor of that...

Side_12
It's horrible, isn't it?

Person_5
No! No! Oh, we're making great
progress!
Here, try some of this.

Person_5
Whoa... okay, just because
everybody hates it doesn't mean
it's not good.

Side_12
Listen, Gru. There's something
I've been meaning to talk to you
about for some time now.

Person_5
What?   What's wrong?

Side_12
I miss being evil. Sinister plots,
large-scale crimes...It's what I
live for! I mean, don't you think
there's more to our future than
jelly?

Person_5
Well, I'm also considering a line
of jams...

Side_12
Um...the thing is, Gru...
I've had an offer of employment
elsewhere.

Person_5
Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're
kidding, right?

Side_12
It's a great opportunity for me,
bigger lab, more evil, full
dental...

Person_5
Very well. Let us give you the
proper send-off.
Minions!

Person_5
The highest honor awarded. To Dr.
Nefario for your years of service.
The twenty-one fart gun salute!

Side_12
Uh, I counted twenty-two.

Side_12
Farewell, my friends.

Side_12
This may take a while. Go about
your business.

Side_12
I miss you already!

Side_13
Hello?

Person_2
Are you sure we should be doing
this?

Person_4
Yes, it's for his own good.

Person_4
Okay, we need to choose a picture.

Person_2
No.

Person_2
Scary.

Person_3
Weird.

Side_6
Aaaaaah!!!

Person_2
What is that?!

Person_5
Good morning, girls! I have an
announcement to make.

Person_4
Hey, what celebrity do you look
like?

Person_5
Ummm...Bruce Willis.

Person_4
Mmmm...no.

Person_2
Humpty Dumpty!

Person_3
Ooh, Gollum!

Person_5
Okay, what are you doing?

Person_2
We're signing you up for online
dating!

Person_5
Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

Person_3
Aw come on, it's fun.

Person_4
And it's time for you to get out
there.

Person_5
No! Stop!      No one is ever getting
out there!     Ever!

Person_5
Okay, now for the announcement:    I
have accepted a new job.

Person_4
Whoa--really?

Person_5
Yes, I have been recruited by a top
secret agency to go undercover and
save the world!

Person_3
You're gonna be a spy?!

Person_5
That's right, baby! Gru's back in
the game! With gadgets and weapons
and cool cars...the whole deal.

Person_3
Awesome!

Person_2
Are you really gonna save the
world?

Person_5
Yes.   Yes I am.

Side_14
Mocha!

Side_15
Cacao!

Side_3
Papadam?

Person_5
Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.

Person_5
Alright, here is the cupcake recipe
I got off the internet.

Person_5
And don't go nuts with the
sprinkles!

Person_9
Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-
ay-ay-ay!

Person_9
Whoo. Wasn't expecting that.
(strikes a martial arts
pose)
Or was I?

Person_9
Ooh... you got... You got... a
little...

Person_9
Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

Person_9
Oh, that's just spreading...um...

Person_5
Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got
it!... Stop it!

Person_9
Oh!     I'll let you get it.

Person_9
Yeah, what you just saw there was a
little something new I've been
working on. It's a combination of
Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare,
and krumping.

Person_5
Okay, that's weird--why are you
here?

Person_9
On assignment from Silas.   I'm your
new partner. Yay!

Person_5
What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom
didn't say anything about a
partner.

Person_9
Well, seems that because of your
checkered past, everyone else
refused to work with you. But not
me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so
I kind of have to do what they tell
me anyway.

Side_14
Walla!

Person_9
You know this guy?

Person_5
Yes, he's one of my minions.

Person_9
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have
known.

Person_9
You're free to go.

Person_5
Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.

Person_9
First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft,
proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral
Shop.

Person_5
No.    Not her.

Person_9
Okay, moving on...

Person_9
Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-A-
Bear."

Person_9
Ooh.

Person_5
I don't think so.

Person_5
Oh!

Side_16
Buenos dias, my friends! I am
Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa &
Salsa Restaurant, across the mall.
Now open for breakfast. And you
are?

Person_5
Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are
closed.

Side_16
This is just gonna take un momento.
I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo
party, and I am going to need two
hundred of your best cupcakes
decorated with the Mexican flag.
It looks something like this.

Side_16
What do you think?

Person_5
Look away!

Person_9
You-- Whoa... Hooo...

Side_16
Anyway, I have to go. It's all
settled! I pick `em up next week!
Have a good day. Come by if you
get a chance, okay?

Side_16
And welcome to the mall family!

Person_5
El Macho.

Person_9
What?

Person_5
But it couldn't be...

Person_9
Wha-- What? What couldn't be??

Person_5
That guy looks exactly like a
villain named El Macho. From about
twenty years ago.

Person_9
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty
dead...

Person_5
They never found the body. Oh no.
All that was ever retrieved was a
pile of singed chest hair.
But... that face. It has got to be
El Macho.

Person_9
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant?
Tonight.

Person_5
Yes, that's good, because I'm
telling you--if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum...

Person_5
...it's him.

Person_5
Alright, alright, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for
bed.

Person_4
What's the big hurry?

Person_5
I just... I have a lot of work to
do.

Person_3
Work, what kind of work?

Person_5
Very important business.
So...hugs, kisses...
...good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah-
blah--

Person_2
But you said you'd help me
practice my part for the Mother's
Day show!

Person_5
Fine, fine... Let me hear it.
Quickly.

Person_2
She kisses my boo-boos
She braids my hair
My mother is beyond compare
We love you, mothers, everywhere!

Person_5
Wow! That was...something else. I
really liked the way you smiled at
the end. Let's try this one more
time, but a teensy bit less like a
zombie, okay?

Person_2
Okay.
She kisses my boo-boos
She braids my hair--

Person_5
Perfect!   Time to go!

Person_2
I don't think I should do this.

Person_5
Well, what do you mean?    Why not?

Person_2
I don't even have a mom.

Person_5
Well, you don't need one to do the
show. I mean, you did the Veterans
Day Pageant and you haven't been in
combat.

Person_2
This is different.

Person_5
Okay, well, then...maybe you can
just use your imagination.

Person_2
You mean I pretend I have a mom?

Person_5
Yes, right. You can do that, can't
you?

Person_2
Yeah! I do that all the time!
Thanks, Gru!

Person_6
Hey!

Person_5
Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no,
no! Hey, please!

Person_5
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for
me, okay?
Dave, Stuart--come this way. With
me! Come on!

Person_5 (O.S.)
Come on!

Side_15
Hey, putt-putt?

Side_18
Oh!

Side_15
Una, doo--
(laughs as he lowers the
golf club to Jerry's
head)

Side_15
Boca!

Side_18
Boca!

Side_15
Looka too!

Person_5
We're stealth ninjas.    We make no
sound.

Person_9
Right.   Gotcha.

Person_5
Alright, El Macho, you're going
down.

Person_9
Wait!    Wait!

Person_5
What?

Person_5
What are you doing?

Person_9
I'm checking for laser beam alarm
triggers.

Person_5
It's a restaurant!

Person_9
You never know what kind of booby
traps this guy could have set.
Huh? C'mon!

Person_5
There are no booby traps!

Person_9
Ha!   Booby!

Person_9
Oh. There's a chicken. Are you
lost little guy? You must be lost!

Person_5
Ha!   Some guard dog.

Person_5
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh!

Person_5
Get it off of me! Get it off of
me! Get it off of me!

Person_5
I got you!

Person_9
I got it!     Ha!

Person_9
Ha!

Person_9
Oh!

Person_5
Ugh...

Person_9
What is wrong with that chicken?
Hey, that pollo? Es loco.

Person_9
No? Okay, let's go.

Person_5
You getting anything?

Person_9
No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you
can find something with these x-ray
goggles.

Person_5
Bah...

Person_5
Ahh!   Ooof!

Person_9
What's wrong? Something wrong?

Person_5
Oh, that's an image I'll never get
out of my brain. Blagh!

Person_5
I knew it!

Person_5
The serum is in here!

Person_9
Ooh, then let's get it!

Person_5
Oh, this is going to be good!
Ahh...

Person_5
A-ha!
(registering it's not the
serum)
What? It's... salsa?

Person_9
Awww man.

Side_16
Oh... somebody's going to die
tonight.

Side_16
Pollito!

Side_16
What'd they do to you? Pollito?
Can you hear me?

Side_19
Boc!

Side_16
Who would do this to such a sweet
little chicken? What? Who's
there?

Side_16
You coming out?! Or am I gonna go
in?!

Side_16
Stop!

Side_16
My eyes!

Person_9
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

Person_5
We've been spotted!    Come get us!

Side_14
Huh?
Hey!     Loo-koo-meow-plah!

Side_3
Ah!    Koom-kwat!

Person_9
Hm.   Subtle.

Person_5
Over here, over here!    Over...
here.

Person_5
Hold tight!

Side_16
I have you now!

Side_14
Rawr, rawr!

Side_3
Oh!   Oh!   Gelato!

Person_6
Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato!

Side_3
Stopa!    Stopa!!

Side_3
Hey-ho! Gelato!

Person_5
Oh.    Okay.

Person_9
See if you can get closer.
Go...go.

Person_5
Alright, what do--

Person_5
Oh no. That's not good.

Person_5
Oh! Girls! What are you doing
here?

Person_4
Well, we thought we'd come visit
you at work.
(looks at Gru and the
trash can)
So, you're saving the world in a
garbage can?

Person_5
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny.

Person_9
Hey, there you are.   Oh, who's
this?

Person_5
Lucy, these are my girls, Margo,
Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy.
Lucy, girls.

Person_4
Hello.

Person_3
Hi.

Person_2
Are you single?

Person_9
Oh!   Goodness...

Person_5
Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since
Lucy and I have lots of work to do,
why don't you girls go and explore
the mall!

Person_5
Here is some money. Go buy some
useless mall junk! Some headbands,
and--

Person_2
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

Person_5
Are you out of your gourd?    No!
She just works with me.

Person_2
Plus you love her.
You love her, you love her, you
really really love her, and you're
gonna get married, and I will be
the flower girl, and--

Person_5
Okay, stop! That is a song of
lies. I don't even like her!
Now go have fun!

Person_2
Almost forgot! Hugs!

Person_4
Good luck saving the world.   Bye!

Person_2
Bye, Gru!

Person_5
Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right?
They're...funny.

Person_9
Those girls totally adore you.       I
bet you're a fun dad.

Person_5
Huh.
I am pretty fun.

Person_2
Is that stealing?

Person_3
Not if my wish was that I would get
a lot of free coins.

Person_4
Whoa!

Side_20
Cool glasses.

Side_20
I'm Antonio.

Person_4
I'm...Margo.

Side_20
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

Person_4
Uh, sure.    I'm...Margo.

Person_4
Um...I'll catch up with you guys
later. Bye!

Person_3
Can I be the first to say...Ewwww!

Person_2
We gotta go tell Gru!

Person_5
All right, I'm going in.

Person_9
--will make a sound like this-- MEE-

Person_5
Okay! I get it!     I get it!

Side_21
It's about time you showed up...Mr.
Gru.

Person_5
You...know my name?

Side_21
When someone moves into the mall
who is follically challenged, I
make it my business to know all
about them. You are bald. And
that is bad.

Side_21
There you go, my sweet.

Person_9
I'm getting nothing so far. I
think you need to move around.

Person_5
Wow, this looks interesting.     What
is it?

Side_21
I take it you're an art lover?

Person_5
Yeah, not so much.

Person_5
Oh, how about this impressive
trinket?

Side_21
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr.
Gru.

Person_9
Nothing.

Side_21
The International--

Person_5
Yeah, I don't care.

Person_9
MEE-MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! Hold on.
I'm picking up something! Behind
that wall!

Person_5
Ah!    And what do we have here?

Side_21
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

Person_5
No thanks. So what's on the other
side of the wall?

Side_21
Here you are! Look at me!     Focus!

Person_9
Gru?

Side_21
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly to
irresistible.

Person_5
Date??? Boyfriend???
What???

Person_2
There she goes!

Person_4
Oh, you're so funny...

Person_3
Gross!    Look, they're in love!

Person_5
Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that
they are...no no no, no!

Person_4
Wow.    You're so complicated.

Person_5
Margo.    What is going on here?

Person_4
Oh! Gru, se llama Antonio.       Me
llamo Margo.

Person_5
Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares.
Let's go.

Person_4
Whoa!

Side_16
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

Side_6
Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome!

Side_16
So good to see you again, mi
compadre!

Side_20
Oh, I see you have already met my
father.

Person_5
What the-- Father?!

Side_16
Si! Look at this crazy small world
we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me
get you something.

Person_5
Oh... look at you.

Person_5
Haha. He likes me!

Side_16
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is
usually very friendly.
He had a rough night.

Person_5
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

Side_16
That is a pity. Young love is
beautiful, no?

Person_5
No!
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other!

Side_16
You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!
They must get to know each other
better. Antonio, why don't you
invite your girlfriend and her
family to our Cinco de Mayo party?

Person_5
No, no, I am--

Side_6
Si!

Person_1
I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we
eliminated him as a suspect? After
the whole salsa incident?

Person_5
Yes, but there has been a new
development, and I'm telling you,
this is the guy. You need to
arrest him immediately. And his
deviously charming son. I'm pretty
sure that the son is involved, too.
The son also. You've got to get
the son.

Person_5
I think that the son is the
mastermind. There's a look.
There's a devilish look in his eyes
and I don't like it!

Person_1
Yes, but I don't really see any
evidence for--

Person_5
Evidence schmevidence! I go with
my gut, and my gut tells me that
this guy is El Macho! Lock him up!
Lock up the son. Don't forget
about the son. The kid gives me
the creeps!

Person_1
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...

Person_9
Uh, but, on the less...
..."crazy" side of things, uh, Gru
discovered traces of the serum at
Eagle Hair Club.

Person_1
Hm...    Interesting...

Person_9
Yeah, and you know who made that
happen? Huh?
This guy. Nailed it. Amazing,
right?

Person_5
No. I mean, sure, but it's not
him. It is...
...El Macho.

Person_1
Mr. Gru.     Please--

Person_5
No.   It is him!   And I will prove
it!

Person_9
Gru, c'mon!

Person_9
He really thinks it's El Macho.
Can you tell?

Side_22
Koonga!

Person_5
Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?

Person_5
Hey, Lance! Where the heck is
Kevin?

Person_5
Alright, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys
get. I can't find anybody anymore!

Person_8 (O.S.)
I've got good news!

Person_8
I have my friend Shannon here with
me! I was thinking you two could
get some grub, you know, tear it
up! See what happens!

Person_5
Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm
not here!

Person_2
Gru's not here!

Person_8
Are you sure?

Person_2
Yes!   He just told me!

Person_2
I mean no, he didn't just tell me!

Person_8
Agnes--where is Gru?

Person_2
He's putting on lipstick!

Person_2
He's swatting at flies!

Person_2
He's...chopping his head off!

Person_2
He's...pooping?

Side_24
I have to tell you, I was so
nervous about tonight. I mean
there's just so many phonies out
there!

Person_5
Yes, I hear you.

Side_24
Oh, so do you work out?

Person_5
Well...

Side_24
I mean, obviously, you don't, but
would you consider it? Huh?

Side_24
Physical fitness is very important
to Shannon. As you can tell,
right? Huh?

Person_5
Ah.   I can tell.

Side_24
Solid.

Person_5
We are in a restaurant, you know.

Person_9
Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?

Side_25
Sure, just a sec.

Side_24
Your accent is so exotic.

Person_5
Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I
was--

Side_24
I know someone who can fix that for
you. And you'll be talking normal
in no time.

Person_5
Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here?
Oof. How's the food?

Side_24
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are
you wearing a wig?

Person_5
What? Ah!
I don't think so.

Side_24
I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate
phonies.

Person_5
Oh. What? No.      These locks are
all mine...

Side_24
No they're not! You know what I'm
gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing
off your head and show everyone
what a bald-headed phony you are.

Person_9
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

Person_5
Hello... Hello, are you...?

Person_5
Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...?

Person_9
Wow, looks like your date's out for
the count. It's like she's been
shot with a mild moose
tranquilizer.

Person_9
Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what
actually happened.

Side_26
`Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She
no like?

Person_9
Oh, she's just uh--

Side_26
Oh, oh, si, si...

Person_9
Shall we take her home?

Person_9
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

Person_5
Huh, tell me about it.

Person_9
Don't worry--it can only get better
from here, right? But if it
doesn't, you can always borrow my
dart gun. I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

Person_5
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
I think I'm good with just the one.

Person_9
Well, good night, partner.

Person_9
This was fun.

Person_5
Yes.   Surprisingly, it was.

Person_9
Oh, and uh, just between you and
me? You look much better bald.

Person_9
See you tomorrow!

Person_5
Quack!     Quack!    Quack!

Person_2
Yeah!

Person_4
So I take it the date went well?

Person_5
No!   It was horrible!

Person_5
High-five!

Person_5
Bump it.

Person_5
Mr. Ramsbottom?

Person_1
Oh, hello.

Person_5
What are you doing here?

Person_1
We got him.

Person_5
Got who?

Person_1
Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located
a secret room in his shop last
night, and uh, discovered this!

Person_1
It's empty, but we found traces of
the PX-41 serum in it. He's our
man. So somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

Side_21
I was framed! You won't get away
with this! Get your mitts off of
me! I am a legitimate businessman!

Person_5
Ah.   Alright. So...what now?

Person_1
Well, now you're free to go back to
your "business." Mmmm. Jams and
jellies. And it looks like Agent
Wilde will be transferring to our
Australian branch.

Person_5
Australia...?

Person_1
Yes. But thank you--for
everything. And by everything of
course I mean...nothing.
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

Person_9
Hey there.

Person_5
Hey.

Person_9
So...we got him.

Person_5
Yay.  That's great.
And now you're going to Australia?

Person_9
Well, it's not definite yet. Still
figuring it out. Already been
working on my accent.
Wallaby. Diggeri-doo. Hugh
Jackman.
So...um. Pretty excited...

Person_5
Great.   Well...good luck.

Person_9
Thanks. You too.
Oh. Here. I wanted to give you
this.

Person_5
Your lipstick taser?

Person_9
Yeah, it's just a memento. Just,
you know, from the first time we
met.

Person_5
Oh.    Thank you, Lucy.

Person_5
Well... it looks like they need
you, so...

Person_9
Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.

Person_2
I brought you an umbrella.

Person_5
Ah, thank you.

Person_2
What're you doing out here?

Person_5
Remember when you said that I liked
Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're
right.

Person_2
Really?

Person_5
Yes, but...well, she's moving away.
I'm never going to see her again.

Person_2
Is there anything I can do to help?

Person_5
Oh, I don't--I don't think so,
sweetheart.

Person_2
Well, is there anything you could
do?

Person_5
"Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know
up to this point our relationship
has been strictly professional, and
you're leaving for Australia and
all, but..."
Okay, here is the question. "Would
you like to--to go out on a date?"

Side_14
Eh, no.

Person_5
Okay, that's not helping.

Person_5
All right.     Here we go.   For real
this time.

Person_5
I can do this.

Person_5
Agh!    I hate you!

Person_5
Ah.

Side_27
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

Side_27
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

Side_27
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo!

Side_15
Tom?

Side_15 & FRENCH MAID MINION
Bello!   Compai!

Side_13
Compai!

Side_29
Blaaah!

Side_15
Oh...

Person_4, EDITH & AGNES
Cinco de May-yay-yo! Cinco de May-
yay-yo! Cinco de May-yay-yo!

Person_3
Whoa!   This place is awesome!

Person_5
Okay. Let's party. Ah? But first
let's go over the rules. Because
what is fun without the rules?

Person_5
Agnes, easy on the churros.

Person_5
Edith, try not to kill anyone.

Person_3
Hai!

Person_5
Margo--

Side_20
Hello, Mr. Gru.

Person_5
Aghhh!    Okay...

Person_4
Gru!

Person_5
There must be the standard six feet
of space between you and boys.
Especially this boy.

Side_20
You are a funny man. There are no
rules, Seor! It's Cinco De Mayo!
Come on! They're starting the
dance!

Person_2
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba!

Side_16
(sensing something's
wrong)
Hey, what's wrong?

Person_5
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
I'm just chilling with the
guac...from my chip hat.

Side_16
Gru, please. I know that look all
too well. It is the look of a
broken heart.

Person_5
How did you know?

Side_16
Believe me, my friend, I too have
spent many nights trying to drown
my sorrows in guacamole.

Person_5
You?

Side_31
Yes. But we are survivors.
There's much more to us than meets
the eye. Enjoy the party.

Person_5
What the--oh!

Person_5
Huh.

Person_5
Oooh!

Person_5
Aaaahhh...

Person_5
Oh!

Person_5
Aaaahhh!

Person_5
Oooohhh.

Person_5
Aha!    Ha ha ha--

Person_5
Oh!

Person_5
Ouch!

Person_9
Say what?

Side_32
Ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good
joke.

Person_5 BABY
I just did a boom boom.

Side_34
I really need you to make a choice,
hon.

Person_9
I choose Gru.

Person_9
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

Side_34
You're welcome!

Person_5
Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El
Macho!

Side_31
That's right!

Person_5
Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I
knew you weren't dead!

Side_31
Of course not. I merely faked my
death, ha, ha!
But now it's time for me to make a
spectacular return to evil!
Doctor, I think it's time we showed
Gru what we're up to here.

Person_5
Dr. Nefario?

Side_12
Nice to see you, Gru.

Person_5
Whaaat? This-- So, this is your
new job opportunity?

Side_12
Absolutely. You're gonna like
this.

Side_31
Sorry--I had to borrow some of your
minions, but it was for a worthy
cause.

Person_5
Oh!   Kevin? Agh!

Side_31
No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he
is an indestructible, mindless
killing machine!

Side_15
Blah!

Side_31
Just watch this!

Side_31
And here's the best part! I've got
an ARMY OF THEM!

Side_31
Soon I will unleash them on the
world--and if anyone, anyone,
tries to stop them...YEOW! Their
city gets eaten!
We can do it together!

Person_5
Together?

Side_31
Together! I have admired your work
for years, amigo. Stealing the
moon?! Are you kidding?! We would
be unstoppable! Men like you, men
like me, we should be ruling the
world!
So, are you in?

Side_12
Woo-hoo!

Person_5
Uh...yeah...probably...

Side_31
Probably?

Person_5
I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes,
I just have a lot going on right
now...I just need to get some
things off my plate before we start
taking over the world, that's all.

Side_31
`Scuse me?

Person_5
No--no, forget it! One hundred
percent! I am in!
(pretending to hear
something)
I think--what is--do you hear that--
I do. That's Agnes calling me from
on the surf--

Person_5
Totally in!

Side_31
You know what? I am not so
convinced that he is in.

Side_15
Blah!

Person_5
Edith!   Agnes!      Come on!

Person_5
Ooof!

Person_3
Sorry.

Person_5
We need to go home now!    Where's
Margo?

Person_2
But I didn't get a turn!

Person_5
Margo!

Person_5
Come on, we're leav--hey, what's
wrong?

Person_4
I hate boys.

Person_5
Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey,
we've got to go.

Person_9
Oops, sorry!

Person_9
Oh, hey!   Eduardo!

Side_31
Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's
usually not like this. The same
thing happened the other day
with... with Gru and...

Person_9
Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you
seen him? I really need to talk to
him.

Side_31
Yes, I think he's somewhere around
here. You two are close, no?

Person_9
Oh, I don't know. I mean close...
I wouldn't say we were close. Why,
did he say we were close? Did he
say that?

Side_31
It's more what he didn't say. For
instance, he never mentioned...that
you were both working for the Anti-
Villain League!!!

Side_31
You're coming with me.

Person_9
Hey!

Side_12
Crikey.

Person_3
So Eduardo's actually El Macho?
Cool!

Person_5
No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty
much knew it was him all along, so
if anyone's cool, it's me.

Person_5
Well, Dr. Nefario...

Person_5
Lucy? Wha--that's impossible!
She's on her way to Australia...

Person_2
He's got Lucy?

Person_5
Not for long.

Person_5
Come on.
We're getting her out of there.

Person_2
What was that?

Person_4
I don't see anything.

Person_4
Run!

Person_2
My unicorn!

Person_4
Agnes, no!

Person_4
C'mon!   Hurry!

Person_2
Whoa!

Person_3
What's the matter?

Person_2
Whoa!

Side_15
Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos?

Person_2
Kevin!

Person_4
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

Side_12
In the flesh.

Side_12
Behold, the antidote!

Side_12
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

Person_5
Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused
here!

Person_6
Okay, okay.

Person_5
Curses. Foiled again. These guys
captured me.

Person_5
Run!

Person_5
Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!

Side_12
Hello, Gru!

Person_5
Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

Side_12
I put an antidote in the jelly.
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil
army to destroy the world, but
nobody messes with my family.

Person_5
Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go
get the--

Person_2
Hi!

Person_5
You brought the girls?

Side_12
Yes!
Oh.     Was that wrong?

Person_3
Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!

Side_31
Oh no! What's happening to my
minions?
Gru?

Person_5
You guys take care of the rest of
the minions.
I'm going to find Lucy.

Person_2
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
Waaaaah!

Person_5
It's over, El Macho.   Now where is
Lucy?

Side_31
Let me show you.

Person_9
Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were
right about the whole El Macho
thing, huh?
Yay!

Side_31
One push of this button and I send
that rocket straight into the same
volcano where I faked my death.
Only this time--it's for real!

Person_5
No!

Side_14
Tally ho!

Side_31
We could've ruled the world
together, Gru. But now--you're
gonna die.

Person_5
Lipstick taser!

Person_9
Aw...he copied me.

Side_31
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

Side_12
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun,
sunshine.

Person_9
Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be
fine. I have survived lots worse
than this.
Okay, that's not entirely true.
I'm actually kind of freaking out
up here!

Person_5
Don't worry--I will get you out of
this!

Person_5
I really hate that chicken.

Person_9
Is there a red one?   It's usually
the red one.

Person_9
Gru, anytime now!

Person_5
Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of
this alive, so I need to ask you a
question.

Person_9
Uh, better make it quick!

Person_5
If I'd asked you out on a date,
what would you have said?

Person_9
Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

Person_5
Oh!  Lucy!
Lucy! Where are you?!

Person_5
Oh, Lucy!

Person_9
Gru!

Person_9
Sorry...I guess you kind of need
your arms to tread water, huh?

Side_2
Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

Person_5
They'll be back...

Person_3
Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

Person_2
Okay.

Person_2
Excuse me!

Person_2
Um...hi!   Excuse me!

Person_2
Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to
make some toast. Uh...

Person_2
She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.
She braids my hair.
We love you mothers, everywhere!

Person_2
And my new mom Lucy is beyond
compare.

Person_2
To the bride and Gru!

Side_35
Blaaaaah!

Person_1
You look so peaceful from up here.

Person_1
Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
again.

Person_2
Person_3
I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
it: we're all supposed to be
"masterminds" - very clever.
I just feel stupid. I mean, what
the hell did Einstein really do
anyway?

Person_4
Theory of relativity.

Person_2
Well, you'd think he'd invent a
wool sweater that didn't itch so
much.

Person_5
The real Einstein once said, "God
does not play dice with the world."
He was right, because the world is
MY dice. Is that understood?

Person_6
Sir! Yes, sir!

Person_2
Yes, sir.

Person_5
Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
have the girl?

Person_7
Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
just like you knew she would.

Person_5
Reporters are a curious lot, and
easily manipulated.

Person_5
Alright, let's not keep the lady
waiting.

Person_8
You didn't need to turn around like
that. I can recognize the stench of
failure.

Person_5
I trust you gentlemen know the very
sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly
regarded investigative journalist
who some say has a more than
friendly relationship with our
super powered foe Uberman. And Miss
Ritchi, I trust you've already met
my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!

Person_8
Looks like a real group of winners.
At the risk of sounding cliche',
you'll never get away with this.

Person_5
In a way, I already have.

Person_8
We go through this every time. You
kidnap me to get to Uberman, he
immediately finds your hideout,
escapes whatever lame trap you've
come up with, and takes you and
your cronies to jail. I propose we
just save everybody some heartache
this time by YOU letting me go, and
ME forgetting this whole thing ever
happened?

Person_5
What about my revenge?

Person_8
We can say it was wasting
everyone's time.

Person_5
You have a wicked tongue. I hope
you rid yourself of that when
you're my queen.

Person_8
I'm sorry. What makes you think I
would want to be your queen?

Person_5
Power corrupts absolutely, Miss
Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
power over this city, I have
absolutely every intention of
corrupting you with it.

Person_4
Sir!

Person_5
What is it!?

Person_1
Master Mind!

Person_1
What's the matter, miss your old
jail cell?

Person_1
You can't possibly believe this
will work.

Person_4
We're now at minimum safe distance,
master.

Person_5
Excellent. Stop here, I like this
view.

Person_4
Twenty seconds until impact.

Person_5
Any last words?

Person_4
Ten seconds to impact.

Person_4
Nine...

Person_4
Eight...

Person_5
What's going on?

Person_1
Hold...on...a second.

Person_4
Seven...

Person_7
What did he just say?

Person_4
Six......Five...

Person_5
What kind of trick is this?

Person_1
Like you don't know. These bars are
made of copper, aren't they?

Person_4
Four...

Person_5
Yeah, so?

Person_1
You figured out my weakness, damn
you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!

Person_4
Three...

Person_5
Your weakness is copper?

Person_4
Two...one.

Person_4
I don't think even he could have
survived that.

Person_2
Whoa! Is it me or did you just
finally destroy Uberman?

Person_5
Well...let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

Person_7
Look, there's something in the sky,
coming this way.

Person_8
Uberman!

Person_5
Person_8
Uberman?

Person_8
You killed him!

Person_2
You did it!

Person_5
...so I did.

Person_2
I mean, I know you always wanted
to. I mean, all the schemes all the
plots - I never thought you'd
actually be capable of it.

Person_2
This is history. Every villain and
lackey in the history of villains
and lackeys dream of this moment,
but when does it actually EVER
happen?

Person_2
Good lord...You do all realize what
we get to do now, don't you?

Person_2
We get to go on a crime wave.

Person_5
Oh, right.

Person_9
It's a sport of honor, focus and
grace. Honor the ball, focus on the
pins, release the ball not hard and
fast, but as if you were releasing
a baby dove.

Person_9
Okay, do something like that - but
center it more.

Side_1
Tell me how my form looks, honey.

Person_9
Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'
REAL good.

Side_2
Now!

Side_2
You're fired. Leave your shirt and
locker key.

Person_9
Fired? Are you going to tell me
why?

Side_2
Showing up to work late. Showing up
to work late drunk. Sexually
harassing customers. Stealing from
the register.

Person_9
Vinnie, I don't know where you're
getting these accusations -

Person_9
Oh, which one do you supposedly
have here?

Side_2
This is all of them at once.

Person_9
I've got this one, Benny. So,
Cinderella. Can I help you find
your glass slipper?

Side_3
Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.

Person_9
Seven - Well, maybe I could
interest you in something in an
EIGHT. Namely, me.

Person_9
Lesbo.

Person_9
From the angle of the camera, I can
see where you might have gotten the
wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't
think you've thought this through.
If you fire me, who's gonna be
captain of the alley's bowling
team?

Side_2
Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody
who can actually bowl. You guys
have never won a game. I hired you
because you said you were on the
pro circuit.

Person_9
No, I said I WILL BE on the pro
circuit.

Side_2
Please, a loser like you will never
amount to anything.

Person_9
Wow...If that's how you feel...I
guess we should then talk about
what kind of severance I'm gonna
get.

Person_9
Hey...what about my ball?

Person_9
Thank-you!

Person_8
It's...um...It's good to be back.
Thanks for everyone's cards and
concerns. I really appreciated it -
now I'm ready to climb back on the
horse.

Side_4
Someone die or something?

Side_4
Oh, Jesus.

Person_8
It's okay.

Side_4
Come on into my office, sweetie.

Side_4
Can we get this woman some water
for God's sake?
I gave you two months off. What're
you doing back? People are gonna
think I'm a slave driver.

Person_8
Aren't you?

Side_4
Yeah, but I don't want people to
think it.

Person_8
Frank, listen. I want to go back to
work. I NEED to go back to work.

Side_4
...You're hysterical, aren't you?

Person_8
What're you doing?

Side_4
Keeping you warm before you go into
shock.

Person_8
It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
everyone knows Uberman and me
were...close. But what I really
need - what would really make me
better is getting back to work.

Side_4
Well, that's going to be...

Person_8
I thought you'd be happy to have me
back.

Side_4
Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us
happier than to have our girl back,
but...

Person_8
Yes?

Side_4
Things have sorta...changed.

Person_8
In three weeks?

Side_4
Listen, I'm not one who likes to
open up wounds - especially ones
that are just starting to scab, but
you were sorta our go to girl for
the exclusive on Uberman. And now
that he's gone...I moved Brad into
your anchor spot.

Person_8
Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an
idiot.

Side_4
It's the suits. They think it's
time to switch things up.

Person_8
Oh, because they can't use me to
get the big story.

Side_4
C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the
nature of what we do. They used
you, you used Uberman. Everybody's
happy.

Person_8
I didn't use him.

Side_4
Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you
two were in love or something. My
bad.

Person_8
We were.

Side_4
And that's great.

Person_8
Very in love.

Person_8
Okay. So, where are they going to
move me if Brad has my spot?

Side_4
...Human interest.

Person_8
Bake sales and pet stories.

Side_4
I told them I wouldn't be surprised
if you just upped and quit. You
busted your ass for that desk.

Person_8
I'll take it.

Side_4
What?

Person_2
Just robbed the diamond exchange.

Person_5
Great, great. Put it on the pile.

Person_2
Anything else today?

Person_5
No.

Person_4
Sir, the new reactor is installed.

Person_4
Do you want to throw the switch? I
know how you love to start
reactors.

Person_5
Maybe later.

Person_5
What is it, Plato?

Person_4
Sir, I can't help but notice that
you've been...a little down lately.

Person_5
When I want your opinion I'll beat
it out of you.

Person_4
Yes, sir, I know, but please
forgive my impertinence. It's just
that you seem to have lost your
lust for our profession. You've
stopped going on jobs and spend
most of your time watching Uberman
specials.

Person_5
I have defeated my greatest enemy.
I have free reign over Metro City.
I have more wealth than a thousand
Sultans. I've achieved all I have
worked for...so why am I so
unhappy?

Person_5
Side_5
I mean, my father, god rest his
evil and tormented soul, raised me
straight from the test tube to be a
symbol of evil.
And, I have accomplished something
he had only dreamed about - the
destruction of Metro City's
champion. I tell you, I've always
lived with this unquenchable
thirst. I thought it was to make
him proud or to get absolute power.
But now that I've pretty much
accomplished both, I am at a loss.

Person_4
...I sort of have a theory about
all that.

Person_5
Oh, really?

Person_4
Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman
was more important to you than you
thought.

Person_5
He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I
wonder, did he consider me his evil
equal or was I just an annoying,
little gnat to him? ...What's the
second part?

Person_4
I think you sort of have a thing
for Roxanne Ritchi.

Person_4
Sir, your plans always involve Ms.
Ritchi either being kidnapped or
placed in danger. If that's not
love, I don't know what is. It's
the grown up equivalent of dipping
her pigtails in the ink well. Don't
you see? She's the one treasure
that's always escaped you.

Person_8
I just wanted to get back to work.

Person_8
I keep trying to tell people it
wasn't really like that. Uberman
and I - We were kinda having
problems. We broke up.

Person_8
Maybe someone who's a little more
aware of his faults. Someone a
little more sensitive.

Person_8
Well, until he miraculously comes
walking into my life, I'm just
going to take a little reflection
time for myself.

Person_5
Who the hell is John Cusack?

Side_6
The Fifth Avenue Renovation
Project, which I championed, will
breath new life into the downtown
area. New life means new jobs and
new revenue.

Person_8
Councilman, is it true that your
brother-in-law's construction
company won the contract for this
project?

Side_6
Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not
here to answer a lot of crazy
questions...

Side_7
Thank you! Thank you for saving me
and my baby!

Person_9
(not knowing what she's
talking about)
Huh?

Person_9
There, there.

Person_9
Okay, we better...well, I hear
these little guys smother easy.

Person_8
What's it feel like to be a hero?

Person_9
Well...I'm just a man doing what
men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,
aren't you?

Side_8
Were you scared?

Person_9
Scared? Who had time?

Person_5
John Cusack, huh? So all I have to
do is have a cute puppy dog stare,
be willing to make a fool of myself
and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.

Person_5
Please, get a hold of yourself.

Person_8
Shit.

Side_9
Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.

Person_8
You're...you're.

Side_9
Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the
actor.

Side_9
Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think
remember something from that one -
Let's see: "My head is screaming `I
want you and need you' - my heart
it keeps reaching to see you and
feel you - yet in the end, I'm
alone once again." Wow, I scare
even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just
really into poetry. Probably
because I'm so sensitive and always
going to great lengths to express
myself. But enough about me. Can I
fill you up?

Person_8
...Yes.
I mean, excuse me?

Side_9
Can I fill you up? Your coffee.

Person_8
Right.

Person_8
I did have a boyfriend - until
fairly recently.

Person_8
I'm sorry - this is so surreal!

Side_9
Yeah, they charge way too much at
these places - Now back to your
boyfriend. I'm interested and
compassionate. I want to know about
you.

Person_8
Things were complicated. He was a
man married to his work. There
was...there was a lot of
competition in his line of
business. I'm sure you know what
that's like.

Side_9
Sure. In my business, one thing I
have is RIVALS. For example, mine
is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.

Person_8
...The body-builder who used to
play The Hulk on TV?

Side_9
Did he? Well, we're always up for
the same roles. Did your boyfriend
have someone like that? A
particular rival that was always
getting his goat - so to speak?

Person_8
Well...one rival in particular
seemed to get more of his attention
than I ever did. But enough about
my problems.

Side_9
Side_10
I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.
Had it ever since Serendipity. I
again. Please, go on.

Person_8
Right, well, he seemed to need him
more than he needed me.

Side_9
How do you mean?

Person_8
It was conflict he thrived on. He
always said he wouldn't know what
to do with himself if Master - I
mean, this guy were gone. It was
like he needed it, like oxygen.

Side_9
I think I finally understand...The
only logical answer is to recreate
that rivalry - or if that's
impossible, create one of equal
structure. That's it!

Person_8
What?

Side_9
Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing
for a part...where I play a man who
talks to himself at inappropriate
times.

Side_9
I have to go right now, but I'd
really like to see you again - if
that's alright.

Person_8
I'd love that.

Person_2
Got her nose!

Person_5
I've got it!

Person_5
I've got it!

Person_5
It's plain and simple.
Extraordinary minds need
extraordinary stimulation. Without
that stimulus they wither and die.
Therefore, there is only one
logical conclusion: I must create a
new superhero.

Person_2
Yeah, maybe that's not such hot
idea...

Person_5
Prepare for Operation Superhero
Genesis!

Person_5
Prepare the subject.

Person_5
Plato, pour the toxic waste.

Person_5
Drainage.

Person_5
Well, Severs?

Side_11
I feel fine. Just a little sticky,
but aside from that everything's
completely -

Person_5
Okay then.

Person_5
And this one?

Person_4
We attached gills to him. He can
breath under water.

Person_5
Ah. Does he have extraordinary
strength?

Person_4
Well...no.

Person_5
Can he fly?

Person_4
No.

Person_5
Resilient to weapons fire?

Person_4
No.

Person_5
He just breathes under water, then.

Person_4
Ah...yeah.

Person_5
Plato, the radioactive spider,
please.

Side_12
Ow!

Person_5
Anything, Stenwick?

Side_12
No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this
was about spiders. I have a pretty
severe case of arachnophobia.

Person_5
We're gonna need more venom.

Person_5
How `bout now, Stenwick?
....Stenwick?

Person_5
This has proven to be a challenge.
I just don't know what I want. What
do I want?

Person_5
I want a man of moral fiber with a
strong sense of right and wrong.
Someone who doesn't seek power -
instead, they must have it thrust
upon them and find, within
themselves, the courage to rise to
the occasion.

Person_2
Yeah, well, it sounds like what you
want is Uberman.

Person_5
That's it! Why make a copy when the
real thing will do?

Person_2
I was just kidding, sir. In case
you forgot, you actually burned
Uberman alive.

Person_5
Then we'll make a new one. Plato,
bring me the box!

Person_5
Behold - Uberessence. The very
thing that gave Uberman his
superhuman powers.

Person_2
Where the hell did you get that?

Person_5
Oh, I shot him with a power sucking
gun and had this idea to use this
to clone a whole army of evil
Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never
got around to following up with
that.

Person_4
I believe he defeated you before
you could, master.

Person_5
...Right. Man, he was good!

Person_7
You want another volunteer, sir?

Person_5
Not another volunteer driven by the
need for personal gain. Somebody
else, somebody pure.

Side_13
...who risked his own life to save
that of a young mother and her
child.

Person_9
Please, please, you're embarrassing
me. I saw someone in need and I
helped them. What more can we ask
of ourselves. I ask you, what more?

Person_5
Somebody like him!

Person_4
Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece
of work. He used to teach bowling
at Kingpin's.

Person_5
A modest profession to brilliantly
hide his true heroic nature. I love
it.

Person_4
Then you are absolutely going to
love this -

Person_4
- He volunteers at a school for the
blind.

Person_5
He volunteers. He doesn't ask for
any reward for his deeds. The fates
are shining down on me. This Mr.
Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.

Person_9
You greedy little bastard. I
already gave you a twenty.

Side_14
Hey, you want me to play along?
Then pay up, bitch!

Person_9
Fine, but you better be convincing.

Person_9
Here she comes, go to work.

Side_14
Why can't I see! Why God?

Person_9
Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me
look at you.

Person_9
You know, in life we're all given
no more than we can bear. This
happened to you maybe because you
were meant to rise above it - Maybe
to be an inspiration to the other
little Peteys out there.

Side_14
You really think so, Hal?

Person_9
Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?
Now c'mon, go feel your way to
class before you get your little
butt suspended.

Person_9
Petey, wait a minute.

Person_9
Don't run into anything!

Person_4
I think I've seen enough, sir. This
is your guy.

Person_9
(obviously playing it up
for the woman's benefit)
Oh, there it is again. This is
really getting embarrassing now.

Side_15
Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man
who saved that woman   and her baby
the other day! It is   you, isn't it?

Person_9
Oh, crap. You got me.

Side_16
Hey, you're on TV again.

Side_17
This just in. Upon a second look at
that tape from this morning, which
we'll now replay for you, it
appears it was not the heroic act
it first seemed to be.

Side_17 (O.S.)
With the tape slowed down you can
actually see the man push the woman
and her child out of the way in an
effort to save his own life.

Person_9
I guess that looks kinda bad.

Person_7
There he is, boss.

Person_5
Now, we're sure this won't kill
him?

Person_4
Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight
electrical shock.

Person_5
Good.

Person_5
Slight electrical shock?

Person_9
God, I hate the weather in this
city.

Person_5
Follow him.

Side_19
You don't look so good, man.

Person_9
I don't feel good. I was struck by
freaking lightening.

Person_9
AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?

Side_19
No, you're just hallucinating. By
the way, we're out of orange juice.

Person_9
Man...

Person_9
Oh, God!

Person_9
Oh, God!

Person_9
Oh, God!

Person_9
Wait!

Person_9
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Person_9
Something's not right here.

Person_9
Wake up! Wake up, Hal!

Person_9
Okay, okay. Let's get it together,
man.

Person_9
This is just some sort
of...episode. It will pass, it will
pass.

Person_9
Well, not too fast I hope.

Person_9
Yes, fast, fast!

Person_9
I think I need to go home.

Person_5
Welcome to your second birth, Hal
Stewart.

Person_5
Instruction is very important in
the formative years. Every hero
needs a mentor, a father figure to
look up to.

Side_20
Perfect.

Person_9
Who are you!?

Side_21
I am the guide on your journey.
Fate has chosen you to be it's
champion.

Person_9
Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I
must be losing it.

Person_9
Jesus! This isn't happening, this
isn't happening.

Side_20
Calm. All things must be filtered
through calmness.

Person_9
Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to
freak out.

Side_20
I think we must work on your
attitude first.

Person_9
Look I'm gonna call the cops in
about two seconds if you don't get
out of here.

Side_20
Are you calm now?

Person_9
Yeah, I'm okay.

Side_20
Good, because we've got a lot of
work to do.

Person_9
What the hell was that for?

Side_20
Rule number one: expect the
unexpected.

Person_9
Can you just tell me what this is
all about?

Side_20
The heavens are not in the habit of
bestowing a gift such as this to
just anyone. You are being rewarded
for being a man of great moral
fortitude with an unwavering belief
in humanity.

Person_9
That's me alright.

Side_20
I am to train you so you may
fulfill your destiny to defeat the
great menace to Metro City: Master
Mind.

Side_20
Come.

Person_9
We're are we going?

Side_20
To train.

Side_20
Strength is just as much in the
mind as it is the muscle. Remember,
both need to be exercised.

Side_20
Hey, Corky? You listening?

Person_9
Yeah, work both muscles.

Side_20
Trust me.

Person_9
What are you doing!?

Side_20
An invulnerability test. Something
wrong?

Person_9
Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to
get shot. Do not fire that thing!

Side_20
You're bulletproof.

Person_9
Okay, do you know that for sure?

Side_20
I do now.

Person_9
You suck.

Person_9
Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.
Two Russian Migs coming in hard and
fast.

Side_20
Hey!

Person_9
What?

Side_20
What did I tell you? Stomach down,
hands up.

Person_9
God, I feel so gay.

Side_20
What is it?

Side_20
Yes, it's John Cusack.

Side_20
...As did I.

Side_20
I'd love to!

Side_20
I mean, I AM a little hungry.

Side_20
Sure!

Person_9
WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's
like fly - Oh my God, I almost said
it was like flying.

Side_20
For the rest of the day I want you
to continue to practice your flying
posture.

Person_9
Why, where're ya going?

Side_20
...To do something...mysterious
...and Asian.

Person_9
Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at
it, then.

Person_8
How's your sandwich?

Side_9
It's quite delicious.

Person_8
Hope you don't think I'm too
forward. Some men are intimidated
when a woman asks them out. I just
find you really easy to talk to.

Side_9
And I you.

Person_8
You know, you're not at all like
you are in the movies.

Side_9
I'm not?

Person_8
Yeah. I don't know - You have this
strange, refined way of speaking.

Side_9
I do? That is most interesting.

Person_8
Anyway, when we were talking the
other day I just felt, even though
we only talked for a couple of
hours, that we've known each other
for years.

Side_9
I know just what you mean.

Person_8
You know what? This sandwich is
disgusting.

Person_8
Of course I already ate half of it.
I wonder what that says about my
character?

Side_9
It means you don't give up on a
sandwich. You see that it has
potential, and you give it every
chance to be all it can be.

Person_8
Thanks, but knowing me, I was
probably projecting my expectations
of what a lunch should be on the
sandwich. It might have been okay
at first, but I just made it
bitter.

Side_9
Is that what happened with your
last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?

Person_8
When I look back, I probably
shouldn't of expected so much from
him. He was already a giving
person. You know, one of those go
out and save the world types.

Side_9
I've run into a few.

Person_8
I was selfish, I guess. I didn't
want to share him with anybody
else.

Side_9
It sounds like he was a special
man.

Person_8
They broke the mold.

Side_9
Perhaps not.

Side_22
What's the "T" stand for?

Side_20
Titan.

Side_22
What's that supposed to mean?

Side_20
It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's
father...oh, just go with it. You
look perfect.

Side_22
I don't think this mask is big
enough. Are you sure no one is
gonna recognize me?

Side_20
It's fine, just don't slouch. It's
all in the posture.

Side_20
It is time.

Side_23
Alright folks, this is a robbery.
Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,
yadda...

Side_24
The safe. Let's go.

Side_25
Okay, just don't hurt anyone.

Side_24
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Side_22
Well, boys, there's no need for all
this just to get the free toaster.

Side_26
What are you suppose to be?

Side_22
Justice.

Side_24
Well, justice, suck on this...

Side_22
Now it's my turn.

Side_22
Hey, George, here comes the sun.

Side_22
Say, Paul, your mother should
know...that you're a scumbag.

Side_22
John, all you need is love...

Side_22
...and a good urologist.

Person_9
Well, Ringo...um...um...you're
under arrest.

Side_25
On behalf of the First National
Bank of Metro City, I'd like to
offer you a reward for your act of
bravery.

Side_22
Ten thousand dollars!

Side_22
I...can't except this. Law and
order is it's own...um...reward.

Side_17
This story's mine.

Person_8
Listen, Brad. We were just in the
area. I was just trying to -

Side_17
I've been in this business long
enough to know pretty well what you
were "just trying to do." Besides,
I heard you couldn't take the big
game anymore and were put on fluff
detail?

Side_27
You're not gonna take that from
him, are you?

Person_8
He's right. Old habit, I guess.
We'll get out of your way.

Side_17
Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake
supper somewhere that needs
covering.

Side_17
For months now, since the death of
Uberman, the citizens of Metro City
have been holding out for a hero.
Well, it appears they won't have to
hold out for much longer as a new
costumed crusader has suddenly
stormed onto the scene. Today, at
the Metro Savings and Trust, a
masked mystery man single-handedly
defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just
who is this new caped avenger?

Side_17
I'm sure all of our viewers are now
wondering, what's the "T" stand
for?

Side_22
It's a message to all the scum out
there. Uberman may be gone, but
Metro City has a new protector, and
his name is "Tighten!"

Side_8
How do you spell that?

Person_5
Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't
believe it. He misspelled his name.

Person_5
No matter, I suppose.

Person_5
We've now fully established Titan
as Metro City's hero. They will
love him just as they loved
Uberman. Everything is going
according to plan.

Person_2
Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
jail.

Person_5
You know, Einstein, maybe I should
have called you Socrates. He also
didn't know when to keep his
thoughts to himself.

Person_2
I just fail to see the point in all
of this. I mean, why are we
creating another superhero when it
was such a pain in the ass for you
to get rid of the other one? I
mean, Uberman is destroyed, we
should be using this opportunity
to...to...

Person_5
To what?

Person_2
I don't know. To take over the
weather, space, the world -
whatever super villains are
SUPPOSED to do.

Person_5
The reason someone like you will
always be a minion is because you
have no foresight. We take over the
earth, like you said. Then what?
Women? Cars? Money? Even the
grandest treasures will lose their
lustre if you don't have someone to
hold them over.

Person_2
That's it! This balance of the
force bullshit is getting way too
Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's
with me?

Person_5
You dare?

Person_2
Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing
stupid costumes, and I'm sick of
working for a super villain who's
turning into a softie.

Person_5
What - did - you - call me?

Person_2
You heard me. You used to be an
inhuman monster, now look at you.
You're creating super heroes, you
don't go with us on robberies
anymore, it's been days since you
threatened anyone, oh, and not to
mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.

Person_5
THAT is none of your business,
knave!

Person_2
Hey, you guys haven't sealed the
deal yet, have you?

Person_5
Silence!

Person_2
Oh, Master, your head is so big.

Person_5
I'm warning you, Einstein.

Person_2
Take me!

Person_5
I said silence!

Person_5
Get out of my sight.

Person_8
Don't get me wrong, I love being a
reporter. I don't think I could do
anything else. It's the
consequences of what we do that I'm
having a problem with.

Side_9
That's where journalistic
responsibility comes in, no?

Person_8
It's supposed to.

Side_9
Sounds to me like you're running
from something.

Person_8
I got someone I cared about killed.
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't
have been involved.

Side_9
You can't blame yourself. My father
used to say each of us must answer
the great call to truly feel alive.

Person_8
Was he an actor?

Side_9
...No. He was...a landscaper. And a
horrible one. I mean he would fail
time and time again at
his...landscaping. And sometimes
he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown
in jail -

Person_8
Jail?

Side_9
My point is he took the good with
the bad. He grew a little each
time. Improved, learned.

Person_8
Was he ever successful?

Side_9
God, no...but don't let deter you.

Person_8
Thanks for this. You know, this is
embarrassing, but it's been a long
time since I -

Person_8
I think it's starting to rain. We
might want to find a table inside.

Side_9
What were you gonna say?

Person_8
Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a
long time since...well, I've been
with someone I...enjoy being with.

Side_9
To people who enjoy being with each
other.

Person_5
Oh, no. Don't look at me.

Side_9
Okay, never mind that. Now, where
were we?

Person_8
Oh my God.

Person_5
You're not gonna get all freaky
about this, are you?

Person_8
This...this is too much, even for
you. God, I go out with you, tell
you my innermost thoughts.

Person_5
I only did this because I wanted to
talk to you on the same level. You
know, without all the baggage?

Person_8
Baggage? You burned my boyfriend
alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!

Person_5
You see, that's exactly what I'm
talking about.

Person_5
Roxanne!

Person_8
Stay away from me.

Person_5
What?

Person_5
Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,
it's his fault. He's the one who
sent me on this weak-willed path.
I'll filet his scrotum for this.
Me, a creature of evil, in love
with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.
I hardly give such matters thought

Person_5
I should just go up there and just
lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I
like you - I always have. Oh, and
I'm sorry I blew up your ex.
(realizing the absurdity of his
words) Yeah, that would go over
like a pants-less clown at a
child's birthday party. What the
hell am I even doing here? Who
cares what she thinks? I'm a
supervillain and here I am acting
like a love struck schoolboy.
Forget this. I control my own
destiny!

Person_5
Perfect.

Person_8
Damn.

Person_8
Please be open.

Person_8
Thank God.

Person_8
A pack of Lady Strikes, please.

Person_5
Hello, Triple A?

Person_5
I'll call you back.

Side_28
Hey!

Side_29
Shut up, Gramps.

Side_29
Gimme that necklace!

Person_8
I don't think so.

Side_29
I said give it to me!

Side_29
What the hell's that? A super
soaker?

Person_5
No, it's a goo gun.

Side_29
Yeah, what's it do?

Person_5
It goos.

Person_5
It's...a prototype.

Side_28
I know you! You Master Brain guy.
You a hero.

Person_5
Don't - EVER - say that again.

Person_8
Hey!

Person_8
Are you following me or something?

Person_5
Don't flatter yourself.

Person_8
Don't walk away from me when I'm
talking to you.

Person_8
What a minute...all that stuff you
use to say to me when Uberman was
alive - about me being the loyal
queen by your side as you rule over
Metro City. That wasn't just super
villain rhetoric, was it? You
actually meant it!

Person_5
My, someone has a rather high
opinion of themselves.

Person_8
Do you really think I would be with
someone like you?

Person_5
No.

Person_4
Everything alright, sir?

Person_5
Fine, why do you ask?

Person_4
You...just...seem...

Person_5
Go on.

Person_4
...distracted.

Person_5
Just with business, my minion. Just
with business. I've decided it is
time.

Person_4
You mean?

Person_5
Yes, we've created our hero, now
it's time to give him a little
motivation.

Person_7
How do we do that?

Person_5
To be simply good is not enough. A
hero must be driven by an almost
relentless desire to right a wrong
that can never be corrected.

Person_4
You mean?

Person_5
Yes, he must lose someone near and
dear to him - his father figure.
Gentlemen, it's time for Operation
Mentor Kill!

Side_22
Man, what the hell happened down
there? Wait a sec -

Side_22
Crap.

Side_22
You okay?

Side_20
I'm dying, kid. There is just one
last lesson I have for you. It is
the most important of all.

Side_22
What's that?

Side_20
Master Mind did this, you must
avenge me.

Side_22
Master Mind? Why?

Side_20
Because he's evil. You must stop
the evil Hal - stop the...

Side_8 1
Tighten, Is this the work of Master
Mind?

Side_8 2
How will the death of your mentor
affect your resolve?

Side_8 3
Was that Pat Morita?

Side_22
This injustice will not go
unpunished. Master Mind, if you can
hear me, Tighten is coming for you.

Person_5
Alright, people, we don't have much
time. Titan should be here any
minute, so let's get the lead out.

Person_5
How's the death ray coming?

Person_7
Nearly up to full power, sir.

Person_5
Hum. Let's turn it down a few
notches. It's his first time and
we don't want to get in a lucky
shot, now do we?

Person_5
Anything on the radar yet?

Person_4
Not yet, sir.

Person_5
I see. Well, he must be planning
something big. Are the flame
androids deployed?

Person_4
All twelve.

Person_5
Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da
Vinci, take your places next to me.

Person_5
No slouching.

Person_4
He's certainly taking his time.

Person_5
He'll be here. That's the way it
works.

Person_5
Unprofessional, that's what this
is. No, it's disrespect for the
craft.

Person_5
Would Uberman have kept us waiting
like this? Of course not. He was a
pro who knew the score. It's time
we spelled out a few things for
this Titan. I will not be made a
fool of.

Side_22
Oh, for crying out loud.

Person_5
Do you know who I am?

Side_22
Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!
You're actually the guy I want to
see!

Person_5
Oh, so NOW you want to get down to
it. Well, I want to get a few
things off my chest first.

Person_5
Of all the inconsiderate - Do you
have any idea how long we waited
for you? We're you even planning on
coming to me and getting revenge?

Side_22
Well, at first I was going to. You
know, because that's what I figured
I was supposed to do. But then I
got to thinking-

Person_5
-You got to thinking? There's
nothing to think about. I'm the
villain. I do something bad, you
come and get me.

Side_22
- I got to thinking...what's the
point?

Person_5
Maybe you're right. What's the
point?

Person_5
What are these?

Side_22
That's what I wanted to talk to you
about.

Person_5
Where did you get all this?

Side_22
Get this: I stole them.

Person_5
From where?

Side_22
From all over. You see, once you
killed Pat and ruined my other
apartment building I was pretty
pissed off, so I figured I'd go,
find you and kick some ass. Then I
thought to myself: "Okay,then
what?" I mean, if we were to fight,
what would I get out of it? Would I
get my apartment back? Would I be
able to pay the bills?

Person_5
Well, what about your mentor?

Side_22
Tell you the truth? He was kind of
a dick. I mean, being a hero is
dandy and all, but it's volunteer
work. Now you've always had the
right take on all this. I mean,
when you rob a bank or take over
the diamond exchange you get
something out of it. I mean, when
you don't get caught, which, no
offense, isn't very often. And that
brings me to what I wanted to
propose to you: Who could catch you
if I'm by your side?

Person_5
You want to team-up?

Side_22
You got the brains, I got the
brawn. We could even call ourselves
that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at
this.

Side_22
I even designed us some new
costumes.

Side_22
See, you'd be brain, so you got a
little one on your costume, and
then I'll have brawn on mine...once
I figure out the best, you know,
visual interpretation of it. What
do you think?

Person_5
What do I think?

Person_5
I think you're probably the biggest
idiot I've ever met. I mean, I
can't believe you. All your gifts,
all your powers, and all you want
to use them for is your own
financial fulfillment. You know
what? Your kind of people make me
sick.

Side_22
I worked hard on this.

Person_5
Oh - gee - I am so sorry!

Person_5
Of all the people to pick, it had
to be this loser.

Side_22
Now, hold on. You're going a little
too far.

Person_5
I wish your mother said that to
your father the night of your
conception, they would have saved
me a whole lot of heartache.

Side_22
Hey, I mean it.

Person_5
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

Person_7
Master!

Person_7
What hurts?

Person_5
It!

Side_22
I don't need you, I don't need
anybody. I have the power to do and
take anything I want. And now, I'm
gonna take back everything this
city owes me. Beware Metro City,
it's time for Titan to collect.

Side_22
Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY

Person_7
How'd the plan go, boss?

Person_5
I just made myself redundant, old
friend.

Person_7
It's not that bad.

Side_33
Morning, Tighten.

Side_22
Morning.

Side_33
Is there something we can do for
you?

Side_22
Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just
here to make a withdrawal.

Side_25
Say, did he just rob us?

Side_33
Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't
it?

Side_25
Yeah.

Side_33
Should I, you know, stop him?

Side_25
Umm...Yeah.

Side_25
(looking down at the
guard)
He did rob us, didn't he?

Side_17
"Absolute power corrupts
absolutely." When Lord Acton stated
that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell
Creighton in 1887, no one thought
much about it, but today Metro City
is reeling from that very prophecy.
Tighten, who many thought of as our
savior, has turned his back on the
cause of justice.

Person_4
I don't understand it. He seemed to
have every characteristic we were
looking for in a superhero.

Person_5
Well, there's no use crying about
it now, we must take action. I'm
not going to play second fiddle to
that crass buffoon. We must destroy
Tighten.

Person_4
It won't be easy. Uberman had a
sense of decency and genuine love
for the people. That was his
weakness and was easily used
against him.

Person_5
Yes, but he possesses the same
flaws present in Uberman's DNA -
copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin
always said: "If something works
don't dick with it."

Side_22
I can have anything I want. I'm
like a god.

Side_22
Point to any woman in this bar. I
could have her in a second.

Side_22
Hey, you wanna get with this?

Side_34
Buddy, what do you want?

Side_22
Side_35
What do you want? That's the
question, isn't it. I mean, what do
you want when you can have
everything?
I suppose what I really want is to
never be forgotten again. I want to
do something that can never be cast
aside or one-upped. I want a -
what's it called? - A legacy. I
want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I
like the sound that.

Side_34
I meant, what do you want to drink?

Side_22
Oh.

Side_22
What?

Person_5
There can be only one master
criminal in this city - and it's
me.

Side_22
Really?

Side_22
I guess I should leave town then,
huh?

Person_5
I have a better idea - NOW!

Person_5
Side_36
That's copper my good man. Your one
weakness.
For all your amazing gifts of brawn
you are no match for my intellect.

Side_22
You know what? You're nothing but a
bug. Not even worth my effort.

Person_5
He's not as dumb as I thought.

Person_4
I guess not...Funny, though.

Person_5
What's funny?

Person_4
Funny Uberman didn't think of the
same thing.

Person_9
That's it!

Person_9
Hello, Legacy.

Side_2
Hey, that's my ball!

Side_37
That was a close one. Sixth floor,
please.

Person_5
Wow, I always thought Uberman was
your first superhero - but it looks
like our little Roxanne dated a
linebacker in college.

Person_8
That's my diary.

Person_5
So it is.

Person_8
It's personal.

Person_5
Well, then I wouldn't leave it in
your underwear drawer for just
anyone to find.

Person_8
What do you want?

Person_5
I need your help.

Person_8
So you knock me out and tie me to a
chair?

Person_5
You're not going to like what I'm
about to tell you.

Side_17
It's chaos here in city square as
city police -

Person_8
He's really out of control.

Person_5
Tell me about it.

Person_8
I should have known. You have
something to do with this, don't
you? - With Titan turning evil.

Person_5
Well, the evil thing he did by
himself. My goal was to give MYSELF
purpose by creating an intellectual
sparring partner.

Person_8
You're talking like you made him.

Person_5
And they call me Master Mind.

Person_8
Let me get this straight. You
missed getting your ass kicked, so
you made a new guy to kick your
ass. That's pathetic.

Person_5
In hindsight...

Person_8
And his powers, they're just like
Uberman's. Why would he have his
powers?

Person_5
I had some left over from
something. I infused him with it.

Person_5
Yeah, that's why I decided to tie
you up.

Person_8
You did all this because you wanted
purpose?

Person_5
He seemed nice.

Side_22
Closer. I want to show the people
my real face.

Side_22
Recognize me?

Person_8
Hal Stewart. He's the guy we
thought saved that woman and kid.
Turned out he was just trying to
save his own ass.

Person_5
Yeah, good to know - NOW!

Side_22
That's right, I'm really Hal
Stewart. Former hero and bowling
teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.

Person_8
You picked a bowler to give super
powers to?

Person_5
It's a modest profession!

Side_22
With my new found power, I've
recently started to wonder what
sort of legacy I should leave.
Should I be a hero? I tried that
once before - even saved a lady and
her baby from being squashed. I was
treated like a god until everyone
started to shit on me - Okay, so
what if I didn't "purposely" save
them!

Side_22
Well, I'm going to make something
that can't be taken away from me.
I'm going to create a permanent
monument to my greatness. One that
won't be so easily forgotten or
erased.

Side_22
I intend to create a new category
in the Guinness Book of World's
Records by rolling the biggest
strike in the history of bowling.

Side_22
My thanks to the city planning
commission. This wouldn't have been
possible without them.

Side_22
Tell your friends and family to
tune in right here to this station
at noon tomorrow.

Person_8
My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy
the whole business triangle.

Person_8
What?

Person_5
My lair is in the direct path of
the ball.

Person_8
Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want
anything to happen to your hideout,
would we?

Person_5
You don't understand. I have
certain equipment that's - that's
highly unstable.

Person_8
What do you mean?

Person_5
I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,
okay?

Person_8
A HYDROGEN reactor?

Person_5
It's experimental - only one in the
world...Well, how do you think I
power all my inventions? Someone
like me can't pay for electricity.
The bills would be outrageous.

Person_5
It creates 100 times the output of
a nuclear one...If destroyed it
could...

Person_8
- Vaporize the entire city!

Person_5
Side_38
Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,
actually. That little baby is
amazing. I'm quite proud of it.
I mean...we'd better find a way to
stop him.

Person_5
Did Uberman have a hideout?

Person_8
What?

Person_5
A cave, a solitary fortress of some
kind. C'mon, all heros have a place
to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,
it may be our only chance to find
something, a clue, anything that
could give us a fighting chance.

Person_8
It's under his house.

Person_5
Whose house?

Person_8
Wayne Scott's.

Person_5
Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne
Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy
philanthropist? But he disappeared -

Person_8
He disappeared just over two months
ago when you killed him. Not only
did you rid the world of a hero,
you killed a kind, noble, generous
man.

Person_8
Looks like you got what you always
wanted. Uberman is out of the
picture and Metro City is doomed.

Person_5
"Metro City doomed." You know, I
never thought I'd say something
like this, but here it goes -

Person_5
Not if I have anything to say about
it.

Person_5
Such a dark place for one such as
you. I wonder, underneath your
noble deeds, what inner demons
drove you to your endless crusade
for justice?

Person_5
Good lord, man. You've only been
dead for two months.

Person_5
A disguise so simple, it's
ingenious. No wonder I never caught
on.

Person_5
Two lives, yet in both you were an
ideal. Perhaps it was you who was
victorious in the end, old friend.

Person_5
I'll miss how predictable you were.

Person_5
Hello? Anyone here...besides..all
the BIG MEN who are with me now?

Person_5
Side_39
What's the worst you're gonna find?
The man was a boy scout, not a
serial killer.

Person_5
Ahhhhhh!

Side_40
Jesus!

Side_40
What the hell are you doing here?

Person_5
I might just ask you the same
question. I had thought I
incinerated you.

Side_40
You scared the bejesus out of me.
How'd you figure out I was still
alive? Wait, how do you know my
identity!?

Person_5
Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,
I forgot to line the bottom of the
copper cage - Somebody pointed that
out to me recently. Figured if they
could do it, so could you. But one
thing I couldn't figure out -

Side_40
The skeleton? Something I
"borrowed" from a medical school a
few months before.

Person_5
A few months? How long had you been
planning this?

Side_40
I always planned to retire -
eventually. I mean, come on, you
can't do this sort of thing in your
fifties. You'd just look
ridiculous.

Person_5
I see it all so clearly now.

Person_5 (CONT'D - V.O)
Then you must have flown to a safe
distance and waited for the
explosion, then...

Side_42
Man, you ARE smart.

Person_5
But why fake your death? Why go
through all of it? You could have
just quit.

Side_40
Side_43
But the responsibility would still
be there.
A cop can retire and stop handing
out speeding tickets - but people
expect more from superheroes. I
tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt
in Zimbabwe without everyone
expecting me to do something about
it. I figured, out of sight, out of
mind.

Person_5
And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to
disappear?

Side_40
Both of my lives have so much
baggage. It's time for new baggage,
you know?

Person_5
I just can't believe it. This whole
time you've been in hiding while a
force of great evil is tearing your
city apart?

Side_40
I don't want to hear about it.
That's why I don't have a
television in here to remind me of
all the things I SHOULD be doing.
Hell, I could get a wife to do
that.

Person_5
There's a demented supervillain out
there about to destroy our - I
mean, your city.

Person_5
You're really going to do nothing?

Side_40
Good and evil have a way of
balancing themselves out. If this
guy is as bad as you say, somebody
will rise up to fight him. It's
just the order of things. You found
me, didn't you?

Side_40
I know it's hard, but you'll find
someone else someday.

Person_5
You're the only one who can stop
him.

Side_40
Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a
plane to catch.

Person_5
A plane?

Side_40
Going to Barbados for a little
change in climate. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I got to go pack.

Side_40
You were a good foe. I'm sorry if
I've let you down. If it makes a
difference, you were the best foe a
hero could ask for.

Person_5
Not smart enough to come up with a
full-proof trap.

Side_40
Well, you did almost have me when
you figured out my weakness was
copper. Now that made me sweat a
little. Took me way too long to
drill out from under that cage.

Person_5
I got lucky.

Side_40
Anyway, it's a good thing for my
sake that I could always count on
you for an out.

Person_5
What do you mean?

Side_40
C'mon, we always threw each other a
couple of bones. You would always
leave me an out in one of your
`full-proof' traps, and I'd never
had you incarcerated at a
penitentiary that you couldn't
eventually escape from. It kept our
little game going.

Person_5
Game? - Was that all this ever was
to you? You know, I was trying my
best every time I fought you. Those
`outs' as you call them were
unintentional.

Side_40
Oh.

Person_5
I guess I was never really a match
for you, was I?

Person_5
Then how can I expect to be one for
Titan?

Person_5
What about Roxanne?

Side_40
I think we both got what we wanted
out of our relationship. She got a
career out of me, and I got plenty
of other things out of her. But I'm
ready to move on to greener
pastures.

Person_5
I guess I wasn't the villain I
thought I was, and you...you
weren't the hero I thought you
were.

Side_40
Roxanne! How long have you been...

Person_8
Long enough.

Person_8
Don't you have something else you
can go do?

Side_22
Alright, I want this whole thing to
look ESPN professional, understand?

Side_22
You guys are about to get some good
footage. I might need a little
room, though.

Side_44
Titan, we have orders from the city
of Metro to take you into custody.
If you do not give your self up
willingly, we will be forced to
open fire.

Side_44
What is your answer?

Side_22
Miss me?

Side_22
Didn't mean to get you involved in
all of this.

Side_22
Hey, man! You killed my suds!

Side_22
That's one was for you, beer.

Side_22
Guys, please tell me you got that
last bit.

Side_17
Huh?

Side_22
You're kidding me. I give you my
sexiest moves and you mean to tell
me it was for nothing?

Side_17
We were afraid something might hit
us.

Side_22
Looks like I've given the story of
the century to the wrong man.

Side_22
Wait. What about that other
reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on
the topper half, but killer legs.

Side_17
Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a
much better reporter than I am. You
want her.

Side_22
Where can I find her.

Side_4
We're actually not supposed to give
out that sort of information.

Side_17
1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe
she lives in a penthouse.

Side_22
You've been very helpful.

Person_5
Hurry, we must be on our way as
soon as possible.

Person_7
Master, why must we flee?

Person_5
I told you, Titan is too powerful.
If he's set on destroying us,
there's precious little we could do
about it.

Person_7
Where are we going?

Person_5
To another city, someplace with a
shitload of superheroes to fight.
We'll start over, we'll go back to
doing what we do best.

Person_4
With our tails between our legs?

Person_5
Plato, do you have a better plan?!

Person_5
Hello...Roxanne?

Person_8
What are you going to do about
Tighten?

Person_5
Right now I'm packing, later I'll
have a snack on the train.

Person_8
You're running away?

Person_5
In a word - yes.

Person_8
You created this monster...

Person_5
I didn't create this - the god's of
irony did and I am eating the crow
I so richly deserve.

Person_8
There's no time for self pity.

Person_5
I'll make the time.

Person_5
You can leave with us. You'll be
safe.

Person_8
I'm not going anywhere.

Person_5
Will you listen to me, no one can
stop him.

Person_8
You have to try. The city needs
your help.

Person_5
I'm afraid you have an inflated
opinion of me.

Person_8
What the hell's happened to you?
The Master Mind I knew would never
have run from a fight even though
he knew deep in his heart that he
didn't have a chance in hell of
winning it. It was your best
quality. You need to be that man
right now...I...

Person_5
What?

Person_8
I believe in you.

Person_5
Sweet words, but that man is dead.
Please, Roxanne, just come with me.

Person_8
No...I guess you are a coward after
all.

Side_22
Man, have I got a story for you.

Person_5
Roxanne? Roxanne?

Side_22
What pose would be best? The corny
folded arms thing?

Side_22
Or maybe on the hips, like this.

Side_22
No, makes me look like a flamer
pirate.

Side_4
Shouldn't we be making a run for it
right about now?

Person_8
The guy can outrun bullets. I don't
think either one of us is in that
kind of shape.

Side_22
She's right, Frank.

Side_22
Also got super hearing. I promise
not to keep the both of you long,
but you'll thank me when this is
all over.

Person_5
Dad, it's me...
(he looks around to make
sure no one can hear)
...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked
in a while, and I'm sorry. It's
been a little crazy trying to live
up to a legacy.

Person_5
Anyway...You raised me to be the
worst that I could possibly be. And
I've tried to live up to that as
best as I could - even dropping out
of dentistry school like you wanted
me to. But I'm about to do
something now that would really
piss you off. I'm going to go
against everything you ever taught
me. I hope...I hope that maybe
you'll look down at what I'm about
to do as not so much a good deed,
but more like the outright defiance
of a hateful and ungrateful, son.
If you could do that, then maybe -
in your own little way - you could -
for probably the first time - find
a reason to be proud of me.

Person_5
Well...either way, you're probably
going to see me real soon.
(calling over his
shoulder)
Men?

Person_4 AND DA VINCI
Yes Sir?

Person_5
Stop packing. Our work is not
finished here.

Side_8
We interrupt your regular afternoon
programming to show you live
footage of a potential dangerous
situation in downtown Metro. The
former hero knows as Titan is
placing what appears to be a giant
ball...

Side_8
Hold on...It appears our own
Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the
scene. We now go to her with a live
report.

Person_7
Sir, I think you should see this!

Person_8
I'm here with the cause of the
destruction in Metro City. He has
kidnapped me and a cameraman to
chronicle what he refers to as the
creation of a monument to his
invincibility and overall
"Asskickiness." He will use this
giant concrete bowling ball to play
the largest game of bowling ever
using the buildings of downtown
Metro City as his pins.

Side_22
And I'm going for the biggest
strike ever.

Side_22
And you, Metro City, have a
ringside seat as I cement my name
in the anal of history.

Person_8
Annals.

Side_22
What?

Person_8
Nevermind.

Side_22
Side_46
(in quiet professional
bowler announcer voice)
Like Tiger before him, a young
savior has come to raise a sport
from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,
a young man with a dream, realizing
that dream here today, folks.
One might click there heels and say
"There's no place like home" upon
finding themselves in such a
fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much
at home right were he is - with a
ball in hand and glory in his
sights.

Person_8
Hal, I know everyone treated you
like shit, but you don't have to do
this.

Side_22
You're right. I don't HAVE to do
anything. Isn't that cool?

Side_22
Here's one for the record books!

Side_22
What the...?

Side_4
Look, what's that flying in the
air?

Person_5
C'mon, slow down

Person_5
C'mon.

Person_5
Gutterball!

Person_5
Bowling? What other trailer park
sports can you play?

Side_22
You are becoming a real pain in my
ass. I should have done this a long
time ago.

Side_47
Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,
he's falling for   it.

Side_22
What the hell?

Person_5
Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
fruit.

Side_22
No more games.

Person_5
Could it really be that easy--

Person_5
Didn't think so.

Side_22
If you don't mind, I'm going to
punch trough your face now.

Person_5
I'm alive.

Person_5
Uberman?

Side_48
It's Uberman!

Side_49
Uberman's alive!

Side_50
We're saved!

Person_5
I thought.

Person_1
So did I.

Person_1
Thank you, old enemy.

Person_5
For what?

Person_1
Showing me the error of my ways,
Showing me I'm meant to be this
city's savior, showing me that,
while we can try, there is no
running away from our true destiny.

Side_22
Oh...Did I interrupt something?

Side_22
Where you going, buddy?

Side_22
Welcome to Paintown. Population:
you.

Side_22
Time to finish this.

Side_22
What?

Person_5
Quick joke - What's the capital of
Thailand?

Side_22
Huh - I don't know.

Person_5
It's bang cock!

Side_22
Ow.

Person_5
So, I guess pennies are good for
something.

Person_8
Pretty strange, huh?

Person_5
They're cheering for me.

Person_8
You saved them. You saved
everybody. How's it feel?

Person_5
It's a...it's nice, you know? I
usually don't get a lot of
feedback.
But I also kind of caused all this.
What happens when they find that
out I was the cause of some of
this?

Person_8
What they don't know won't hurt
them.

Person_5
I guess that is all in the past.

Person_8
You're the hero.

Person_5
I don't think I'd go that far...I
mean I just...er...

Person_8
Master Mind?

Person_5
Yes?

Person_8
Stop talking.

Side_51
Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.
It seems the former villain has
done a career 180 after defeating
Tighten and saving Metro City from
certain enslavement. And here he is
getting a full pardon by Metro
City's Mayor, Steve Dent.

Side_52
Ahhh!

Person_5
Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.

Person_5
We're okay, right?

Side_17
And what about Tighten? Is there a
prison in existence that can hold
this super powered menace? Well,
the answer we found is no.

Side_53
Of course normally he could break
out of there anytime, but as you
can see we've taken some special
precautions.

Side_17
What is a Hero? It seems never has
that question needed to be asked
more than it does tonight. We go to
our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making
her triumphant return to our news
desk for the answer.

Person_8
What is a hero? Well, there are
many different kinds. There are
those who hear a call, like the
policeman or doctor, then there's
the kind the public creates in
their search for meaning and hope.
Then, there are those who have the
courage to change.

Person_5
I'm gonna give you a chance to
surrender.

Person_5
Way to take out those two goons,
guys!

Person_7
What two goons?

Person_5
Sorry, we're new at this.

Person_1
...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.
It was pure insanity.

Person_1
Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...

Person_1
Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --

Person_2
Cappuccino, please.

Person_3
On us.

Person_2
No, I insist.

Person_1
Shit.

Person_3
Where do you think you're going?

Person_1
It's -- five past...

Person_3
You'd better be here early tomorrow.

Person_1
Ok.

Person_1
And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...
Revision                      4.

Person_1
No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
waiting `til Denver to tell her...?
Oh. I see...
No, you're right. I understand.
Ok... I just... Oh...

Person_1
No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --

Person_4
One second.

Person_4
...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
done in here.

Person_4
You know what? I think we're good. Thanks
for coming in.

Person_5
Holy Mother of God.

Person_5
Ever heard of a vent?

Person_1
I wanted to give you an entrance.

Person_6
(appearing in the hall, 26,
eating Cheetos)
Mia! How'd it go?

Person_1
Eh...

Person_6
Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

Person_1
I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.

Person_6
They're the worst.

Person_1
I don't know if they were there.

Person_6
I bet they were.
Revision                           6.

Person_7
Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

Person_5
Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,
right?

Person_1
Can't. Working.

Person_1
Yes?

Person_5
Look, I know things didn't go well today.
There are four things in my inbox that
you're perfect for and I will submit you.
But right now -- you're coming.

Person_5
It'll be fun.

Person_1
It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed
into one of those glass houses.

Person_5
Exactly. Fun.

Person_5                         MIA
This looks familiar.             I was going to give it
back!

Person_6
Come on, Mia. When else do you get to
see every Hollywood clich crammed
into a single home?

Person_5
Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's
nothing to make fun of. This party will
be humanity at its finest.

Person_1
No...

Person_9
You gotta stop breaking into my home.

Side_1
You think Mom or Dad would call this a
home?

Person_9
Please don't sit on that.

Side_1
Are you serious?

Person_9
Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.

Side_1
I wonder why.
I brought you this. It's a throw rug.

Person_9
Don't need it.

Side_1
Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis
pissed on it?

Person_9
That's almost insulting...
Did he?
Revision                        11.

Side_1
When are you going to unpack these boxes?

Person_9
When I unpack them in my club.

Side_1
Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with
you and you're stalking her.
You're not still going by there, are you?

Person_9
No.

Person_9
They've turned it into a tapas-samba
place. You believe that?

Side_1
Seb --

Person_9
Who wants to tapas while they samba?

Side_1
I have someone I want you to meet.

Person_9
I don't want to meet anyone.

Side_1
You'll like her.

Person_9
Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?

Side_1
Probably not.

Person_9
Then what are we gonna talk about?

Side_1
You'll talk about the weather.

Person_9
Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to
meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart
of gold.
Revision                      12.

Side_1
Sebastian --

Person_9
How long's it been?

Side_1
You need to get serious. You live like a
hermit. You're driving without insurance.

Person_9
I am serious. I had a very serious plan
for my future. It's not my fault I got
Shanghai'ed.

Side_1
You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got
ripped off.

Person_9
What's the difference?

Side_1
It's not as romantic as that.
And everyone knew that guy was shady
except for you.

Person_9
Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty
word?

Side_1
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

Person_9
You're acting like life's got me on the
ropes -- what you don't understand is, I
want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life
hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna
make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.

Side_1
I love you. Unpack your boxes.

Person_9
I'm changing the locks.
Revision                       13.

Side_1
You can't afford it.

Person_9
I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!

Side_2
Seb.

Person_9
Bill. Thanks for having me back.

Side_2
Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
Revision                       14.

Person_9
Of course.
(under his breath as he heads
to the piano)
Though I don't think they care what I
play.

Side_2
I do, and I don't want to hear the free
jazz.

Person_9
How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two
for you, one for me?
Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that
works. Good deal.

Side_3
Well... Welcome back.

Person_9
There's a nice way to say that.

Side_2
...every goddamned night.

Person_9
I'll stick to the set list, I promise --

Side_2
Too late. You're done.

Person_9
You're not gonna find a better player. You
know that.

Side_2
Do you think anyone here gives a shit?

Person_1
I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --

Side_4
Revision                         16.

Person_1
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
Did you test for achromatopsia?

Person_1
D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off
at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.

Person_1
This is my classroom. You don't like it,
the door's to my left.

Person_1
No, Jamal. You be trippin'.

Person_5
There you are! You need to meet someone!
Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.

Side_5
Nice to meet you, Mia.          He's got projects all over
town.

Side_6
They say I have a knack for world-building.

Person_1
Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...
Revision                        17.

Side_7
Alright, one more for y'all before we
break. Do I hear any requests?

Person_1
"I Ran".

Side_7
"I Ran" it is.
Wanna start us off, piano-man?

Side_7
I walked along the avenue...

Person_9
Ok. I remember you.

Person_9
And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.

Person_1
"Curt"?

Person_9
Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
Revision                       18.

Person_1
Ok.

Person_9
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician -- it's too far.

Person_1
My God. Did you just call yourself "a
serious musician"?

Person_9
I don't think so.

Person_1
Can I borrow what you're wearing?

Person_9
Why?

Person_1
Because I have an audition next week. I'm
playing a serious fire-fighter.

Person_9
So you're an actress. That makes sense.
Have I seen you in anything?

Person_1
Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner
Brothers lot. That's a classic.

Person_9
Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how
you can look down on me from all the way
up there.

Side_7
Sebastian. Second set.

Person_9
He doesn't tell me what to do.

Person_1
He just told you what to do.

Person_9
I let him.
Revision                          19.

Person_9
What's your name?

Person_1
Mia.

Person_9
Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.

Side_7
Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you
did tonight...

Side_6
...Goldilocks from the point of view of
the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox
and Warners are going crazy for it.

Side_6
...We're going after Charlize. For the
bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a
franchise. But the thing is it's grounded.

Person_1
George Michael!

Person_9
You again.

Person_1
Did you just get your keys?

Person_9
...Yeah.
Revision                       20.

Person_1
Can you grab mine?

Person_9
...Which one is it?

Person_1
The Prius.

Person_1
The one with the green ribbon.

Person_1
Shit...

Person_9
Those look comfortable.

Person_1
They are...n't.

Person_1
Thank you for saving the day back there.

Person_9
You didn't give me much of a choice.

Person_1
Strange that we keep running into each
other.

Person_9
It is strange. Maybe it means something.

Person_1
I doubt it.

Person_9
Yeah I don't think so either.
Revision                        21.

Person_9
Put the clicker under your chin.

Person_1
What?

Person_9
It turns your head into an antenna.
Probably gives you cancer, but you find
your car more quickly.

Person_1
Uh-huh.

Person_9
You don't live as long, but you get
things done faster, so it all evens out.

Person_1
Oh my God.

Person_1
Eh.

Person_9
Not much to look at.

Person_1
Agreed. I've seen better.

Person_1
Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah,
I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...

Person_1
Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride
to your car?

Person_9
No, that's fine... Thanks...

Person_1
...Ok...

Person_1
Night.

Side_8
Are these pastries gluten-free?

Person_1
No...

Side_8
What?? I want a refund.

Person_3
You're closing up Friday.

Person_1
I have an audition. Remember?

Person_3
Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.

Person_1
But you said --

Person_3
And fix your apron.

Person_1
...Hi.
What are you doing here?

Person_9
Meetings. Studio heads.
Revision                       24.

Person_1
Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?

Person_9
Piece of cake.

Person_9
Actually it took me four hours and I
ended up running. We probably have twenty
minutes before the guy finds me. You got
a break coming up?

Person_1
I'm off in ten.

Person_9
Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.

Person_1
That's the window Ingrid Bergman and
Humphrey Bogart looked out of in
Casablanca.

Person_9
What's your Bogart's name...?
Is it Greg?

Person_1
Yeah. Greg.

Person_9
How long have...?

Person_1
We've been seeing each other for a few
months.

Person_1
I love this stuff. Makes coming to work
easier.

Person_9
I know what you mean. I get breakfast
five miles out of the way just to sit
outside a jazz club.

Person_1
Oh yeah?

Person_9
It was called Van Beek. The swing bands
played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.
It's a samba-tapas place now.

Person_1
A what?

Person_9
Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on
history.

Person_9
Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything
and they value nothing.

Side_9
Clear the frame!

Person_1
We need to wait here.

Person_9
I know. They shoot movies on my street.
"C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to
sign out."

Person_9
How'd you get into all this?
Revision                          26.

Person_1
Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an
actress. She was in this traveling
theater company... And there was this
little library across the street from my
house when I was growing up. This was
Boulder City, Nevada -- every house
looked exactly the same. I was ten and
already I needed to get out. And one day,
my aunt flew into town, and she showed me
the library's old-movie section. We spent
a whole day watching one after the other.
Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.
I never knew the world was so big.

Person_1
I started putting on plays in my garage.
I'd write the scripts and print up
programs, and she'd give me props to use
from wherever she'd just been -- New
York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet
off again and I wouldn't hear from her
for another year.

Person_9
Who would you invite to watch? Your
parents?

Person_1
God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That
would have been terrifying.

Person_1
Honestly, I wish I loved something else.
I've tried so hard to want other things.

Person_1
I left school after two years to come here,
my fourth manager just dropped me, and my
last audition was for a teen soap pitched
as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.
Should've been a lawyer.
Revision                        27.

Person_9
...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.

Person_1
Well it doesn't need more actresses.

Person_9
You're not just an actress.

Person_1
What do you mean, "just an actress"?

Person_9
You said it yourself, you're a child-
prodigy playwright.

Person_1
That is not what I said.

Person_9
You're too modest to say it but it's
true. So you could write your own roles.
Write something that's as interesting as
you are.

Person_1
Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine
for an open-mic night. It was horrible.

Person_9
All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong
could have played the marching-band
charts he was given. What did he do
instead? He made history.

Person_1
Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make
history instead.

Person_1
Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's
something I should tell you...

Person_9
Yeah?
Revision                       28.

Person_1
I hate jazz.

Person_9
What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?

Person_1
It means when I listen to it I don't like
it.

Person_9
But it's such a blanket statement. It's
like saying "I hate animals".

Person_1
I do hate some animals.

Person_9
Do you need to be anywhere right now?

Person_9
Most people say they hate jazz because
they don't have context. They don't get
where it came from. All these people
packed into flophouses in New Orleans,
speaking five different languages, and
jazz was how they talked to each other.

Person_1
I thought it was just Kenny G.

Person_9
...What?

Person_1
I associate it with facials. It's
relaxing.

Person_9
It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a
gunfight `cause somebody told him he
played a wrong note!
Revision                           29.

Person_1
Right, but it's good to talk over. Where
I grew up there's this jazz station
they'd play at cocktail parties whenever
they served the salami and cheese.

Person_9
Mia. These are things you can't unsay.

Person_9
It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-
wire act. These guys are performing and
composing and rearranging all at once.

Person_9
That's why you need to be in the space
and see what's at stake. This whole thing
-- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll
head off to cut commercial sessions or do
pit at the Pantages `cause they have to --
but when I have my own place -- my club --
they'll play whatever they want.

Person_1
Your club?

Person_9
...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm
getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.

Person_9
The world tells everyone to move on. Says
the music's had its moment. But I love it
too much. I'm not moving on.

Person_9
So?

Person_1
Hi, I just missed a call...

Person_1
I got a call-back!

Person_9
Really? For what?

Person_1
That show I told you about.

Person_9
Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?

Person_1
Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel
Without a Cause.

Person_9
That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!"

Person_9
You've seen it, right?

Person_1
Obviously.
No.

Person_9
What? You're the movie person.

Person_1
It's the one I lie about.

Person_9
Come on. You can't do this audition and
never see Rebel. The theater near me's
playing it. If you want -- I can take
you. For research.

Person_1
...Ok.
Revision                          31.

Person_9
10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?

Person_1
Ok.
For research.

Person_1
Hi, Mom!

Person_1
Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.

Person_1
Well -- it's not picked up yet.

Person_1
First they make the pilot, then if they
like the pilot it goes on TV.
Revision                           32.

Person_1
Well, no, I have a call-back.

Person_1
It's another audition.

Person_1
...Well when you put it like that it
sounds like a huge accomplishment.

Person_1
Oxygen.

Person_1
You know what, I have to go. I love you.

Side_10
Mia Dolan?

Side_11
Whenever you're ready.

Person_1
Two options. Follow my rules, or follow
my rules. Kapish? You want to bully,
you'd best be ready to get bullied --

Side_11
Thanks.

Person_1
I can do it another way --

Side_11
No, thanks, that was great.

Person_6
Mia?

Person_6
Greg's here...

Side_12
Hey... I'm parked out front. But we
should hurry, my brother just landed.

Side_12
Did you forget?

Person_1
Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...

Side_12
It's ok.

Side_12 (O.S.)
Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will
be there in twenty.

Side_14
That's right -- but now we've got a
surround-sound set-up, so it's like --

Side_15
It's like being in a movie theater.

Side_14
It's better than going to a theater,
really. You know theaters these days --

Side_12
Oh, sure --

Side_14
-- they're so dirty, and they're either
too hot or too cold, and there's always
people talking, which is just --
-- just so annoying, I mean you're trying
to watch a movie -- one second --
Hello?...

Side_15
Probably work.

Side_14
Yeah, I'll have to call you back.
So, yeah, we love it.

Side_14
One word for you. Nicaragua.

Side_12
I've never heard anyone say that. Was it
amazing?
Revision                          36.

Side_14
Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort.
It was unbelievable.

Side_12
Mia?

Person_1
I'm sorry.

Person_1
I have an idea.

Person_5
Is that a script?

Person_1
It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.

Person_1
Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman
show...

Person_5
...Is that gonna happen every time?

Person_1
I think so.

Person_1 (O.S.)
It's one-way!!

Person_9
Keith?
Revision                       41.

Side_17
Holy shit. Come here, man.

Person_9
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.
We used to play together.

Side_17                           MIA
Hey, Mia.                         Hey...

Side_17
So how've you been?

Person_9
Great. You?

Side_17
Keeping busy. Got a new combo.

Person_9
Good for you.

Side_17
...Looking for keys.

Person_9
I'm good.

Side_17
You sure? It pays.

Person_9
I'm good.

Side_17
Let's just grab a drink then. Call me.
It's been too long.

Person_9
You bet.

Side_17
Nice meeting you, Mia.
Revision                           42.

Person_1
Nice meeting you.

Person_9
It's beautiful.

Person_1
...You're just saying that.

Person_9
No... I'm not.

Person_1
I don't know... Is the whole thing too
nostalgic?

Person_9
That's the point.

Person_1
But do you think people will like it?

Person_9
Fuck `em.

Person_1
You always say that.

Person_9
I truly believe it.

Person_1
Fine -- as long as you sit front-row
`cause I'll probably throw up on the
middle of the stage otherwise.

Person_9
I'll be front-row.

Person_1
I made something for you.

Person_9
What's that?

Person_1
It could be the name design. On the door.

Person_9
Why does it say "Seb's"?

Person_1
That's what you should name it.

Person_9
Never.

Person_1
Sebastian, no one's going to a club called
"Chicken on a Stick".

Person_9
You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name
"Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's
gonna be old-school jazz and beer and
chicken. "Chicken on a Stick".

Person_1
No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.
And it's time to start looking for other
places.

Person_9
It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them
samba all over its history.

Person_1
Make your own history.

Person_9
Your play's incredible.

Person_9
The whole world from your bedroom? Who's
doing that?
Revision                    44.

Person_1
I'm doing that.

Person_1
So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?

Person_9
...Which guy?

Person_1
The one who offered you a gig.

Person_9
You mean Keith? He's the worst.

Person_1
Why was it weird between you two?

Person_9
It's always weird with him.

Person_1
He did offer you a job.

Person_9
Right...

Person_1
Are you going to call him?

Person_9
No.

Person_1
Ok...

Person_9
Here's what we know. It's definitely
Chicken on a Stick --
-- and your play is going to be a
triumph.

Person_1 (O.S.)
Look -- he's going to find a way to open
it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's
Dad?

Side_17
Sebastian.

Side_17
Didn't know if I'd see you today.

Person_9
Well... Here I am.

Person_9
Where's the piano?

Side_17
Here's the deal. We've got distribution
with Universal, got our own imprint.
We're about to go on the road. We can cut
you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus
an equal share of any merchandise or
ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?

Side_17
Sebastian?

Person_9
Yeah, that...that...
...sounds good.

Side_17
Let's play, see how it feels.

Side_17
I know. It's different.

Side_17
But you say you want to save jazz. How
are you going to save jazz if no one's
listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people
hadn't gotten tired of what they were
listening to before.
I mean, do you really think a bunch of
ninety-year-olds in a basement is the
future of the form? Traditionalists whined
when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs.
If traditionalists had their way, we'd
still be playing Dixieland.

Person_9
You're holding onto the past. But jazz is
about the future.

Side_17
I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't
as good as you. But you're a pain in the
ass, man.

Side_17
If it's not your thing, just let me know.
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying
to change this into something it's not.
But if you want it -- the job's yours.

Side_19
Revision                      48.

Person_9                        MIA
City of stars...              You've never shined so
brightly.
Revision                           50.

Side_21
Revision                          51.

Side_1
Look at him -- watch --

Side_1
Now he's going to check the other window.
Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check
again. Yep, still closed.

Side_22
Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two
want anything?

Person_1
Thanks Harry, I'm good.
Revision                       52.

Side_1
Same here but I think someone's trying to
break into your car.

Side_1
Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?

Person_1
I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...

Side_1
You should come over tonight. Harry's
cooking, but don't let that stop you.
What's the matter?

Person_1
Nothing...

Side_1
You miss him.

Person_1
I guess. I'm adapting.

Side_1
I got used to being alone. Growing up it
was just me and Seb. We only had each other.

Person_1
He told me.

Side_1
I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met
Harry and -- we just fit...
You've changed Seb. You know that?

Person_1
Do you think he's happy?

Side_1
Is he happy?

Person_1
I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.
Revision                        53.

Side_1
Our dad never got to do what he wanted.
We were always treading water, he took a
job running a washer-dryer store. But
every night at home he'd play his
clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record.
So I look at Sebastian... Playing music,
getting paid for it. I'm happy for him.

Side_1
Dreams change.

Side_1
Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon.

Side_1
I told you not to get me anything!

Side_22
Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess.

Side_1
No -- I changed my mind.

Person_1
Hey it's me... Not sure where you are --
maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I
haven't heard from you in a while... I
miss you...
Ok... Bye...

Person_9
Surprise.

Person_9
And...
(he hurries to the kitchen --
and holds up a big apple pie)
There's twenty-five pounds of apples in
it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem
but it tastes good.

Person_9
I have to head back in the morning but I
needed to see you.

Person_9
Feels so good to be home.

Person_1
Stay.

Person_9
How's the play going?

Person_1
I'm nervous.
Revision                 55.

Person_9
Why?

Person_1
Because...
What if people show up?

Person_9
Fuck `em!

Person_9
You're nervous about what they think?

Person_1
I'm nervous to be up on a stage and
perform in front of people. I'm
terrified.

Person_9
They should be so lucky to see it.
It's going to be incredible. I can't
wait.

Person_1
I can.

Person_1
What time do you leave in the morning?

Person_1
Ugh.

Person_9
Yep. Boise.

Person_1
Boise?

Person_9
You should come.

Person_1
To Boise?
Revision                     56.

Person_9
Yeah, you could knock that off your
bucket list.

Person_1
Wish I could.

Person_9
Why can't you?

Person_1
Come to Boise?

Person_9
Yeah.

Person_1
Because I have to rehearse.

Person_9
Can't you rehearse anywhere?

Person_1
You mean anywhere you are?

Person_9
...I -- I guess...

Person_1
Well, all my stuff is here and my show's
in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it
doesn't seem practical...

Person_9
Right... I just -- we're going to have to
do things so we can see each other. We
never see each other.

Person_1
I know, but when are you done?

Person_9
...What do you mean?

Person_1
When are you done with the tour?
Revision                   57.

Person_9
But -- as soon as we're done with the
tour we go back and record, and then we
go back on tour.

Person_9
We tour so we can make the record, and
then we go back on tour to sell the
record.

Person_1
So it's...the long haul?

Person_9
...What does that mean?

Person_1
I mean the long haul -- like, you're
going to be in this band for a long time.

Person_9
What did you think I was going to do?

Person_1
I don't know, I didn't think the band
would --

Person_9
You didn't think we'd be successful.

Person_1
No, that's not what I meant. What I meant
was -- this band -- you're going to be on
the road for -- what, years now?

Person_9
Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road
for years with just this record.

Person_1
Do you like the music you're playing?

Person_9
I don't know how that matters.

Person_1
It matters if you're going to give up
your dream to be on the road for years.
Revision                    58.

Person_9
Do you like the music I'm playing?

Person_1
Yes. I do.
I just didn't think you did.

Person_9
Yeah, well, I --

Person_1
And now I hear you're going to be on the
road for years, and I'm --

Person_9
What are you doing? Why are you doing
this?

Person_1
What do you mean why am I doing this?

Person_9
This is what you wanted from me.

Person_1
To be in this band?

Person_9
To have a steady job.

Person_1
Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you
could take care of yourself and start
your club.

Person_9
So I'm doing that. So why aren't we
celebrating?

Person_1
Why aren't you starting your club?

Person_9
You said yourself no one wants to go to
that club! No one wants to go to a club
called Chicken on a Stick --

Person_1
Change the name!

Person_9
-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.
Revision                         59.

Person_1
I do like jazz now, because of you.

Person_9
What am I supposed to do? Go back to
playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save
money for some Shangri-La club no one
wants to go to?

Person_1
People will want to go to it! People love
what other people are passionate about.

Person_9
Not in my experience.

Person_9
Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know?
This is what I'm doing. If you had a
problem, I wish you would've said
something earlier, before I signed on the
dotted line.

Person_1
You had a dream that you were sticking
to, that --

Person_9
This is the dream!

Person_1
This is not your dream.

Person_9
Guys like me go their whole lives and
never do anything that's liked. I'm
finally doing something that people
enjoy. What is wrong with that?

Person_1
Why do you care so much about being liked

Person_9
You're an actress, who are you to talk??

Person_9
Maybe you liked me more when I was a
failure because it made you feel better
about yourself.

Person_1
Are you kidding?

Person_9
No.

Person_9
Wait --

Person_9                          COLE
See you tomorrow.                 See ya.

Side_17
You good for tonight, right?

Person_9
...Tonight?

Side_17
Seven. The photo shoot.
Mojo.

Person_9
I thought that was next Thursday.

Side_17
No. It's tonight.

Side_17
Is that ok?

Side_24
Put a light on the drums... I need more
fill in this corner...

Side_24
Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the
keys.

Side_24
Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live.
Piano look up, play.

Side_24
No -- piano -- actually play something.

Side_24
Good, now bite your lip like you're
concentrating on a solo.

Side_24
That was good. Don't stop.

Person_9
Mia!

Person_9
I'm sorry --

Person_1
Stop --

Person_9
I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm
sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise
I'll make it up to you --

Person_1
It's over.

Person_9
...What do you mean?

Person_1
I'm done embarrassing myself.

Person_9
You didn't embarrass yourself...
Revision                     65.

Person_1
No one showed up. I can't even pay back
the theater.

Person_1
I'm gonna go home for a while.

Person_9
...This is home.

Person_1
Not anymore.

Side_1
You remember the McKenzies?

Person_9
Oh God, I didn't see them.

Side_1
Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so
handsome".

Person_9
You look beautiful.
I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.

Side_1
You were great
You're always great when you play.

Side_1
Now -- listen to me. I want you to save
for a down payment. You understand? You
need a home.

Person_9
Yes ma'am.

Side_1
I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.

Person_9
...You still think New York?

Side_1
I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know,
it's exciting...

Side_1
Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...

Side_1
Is my...my hair...?

Person_9
What...?

Person_9
Wrong number.

Person_9
Yeah, well...not anymore.

Person_9
I won't.

Person_9
"Casting"...?
Revision                      68.

Person_1'S MOM                            MIA
Night, sweetie.                 Night, Mom.

Person_1'S DAD
You want some more rice?

Person_1
I'm ok.

Person_1'S DAD
You look hungry.

Person_1
I'm good...

Person_1'S DAD
It's fun having you back. Your mom
ditches me at ten.

Person_1
You took down the swing.

Person_1'S DAD
She made me.

Person_1'S DAD
I've still got all your old tapes.

Person_1
Oh God. Throw those away.

Person_1'S DAD
Never.

Person_1'S DAD
What the hell...?

Person_1
Why did you come here?

Person_9
Because I have good news.

Person_1
Ok...

Person_9
Amy Brandt. The casting director.

Person_1
I know who she is.

Person_9
She was at your play. And she loved it.
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come audition for a huge movie
she's got.

Person_1
I'm not going.

Person_9
...Excuse me?

Person_1
I'm -- no... That will kill me.

Person_9
That's it?

Person_1
Yes.
Revision                    70.

Person_9
So you're happy here?

Person_1
I'm happier.

Person_9
Why won't you come?

Person_1
I told you.

Person_9
I don't buy it.

Person_1
Because it's another audition!
I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do
you want to know what happens? Either
they interrupt me because someone ordered
a sandwich, or they cut me off after two
seconds, or I'm crying and they start
laughing, or I'm one of a hundred
lookalikes in the waiting room who never
has a chance, because --
-- because --

Person_9
Because what?

Person_1
Because I'm probably not good enough.

Person_9
Yes you are.

Person_1
No. Maybe I'm not.

Person_1
Maybe I'm one of those people who's
always wanted to do it but never had a
chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's
like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.

Person_1
I can go back to school. I can find
something else that I'm supposed to do. I
left school to give it a shot, and it
didn't work out, and it took six years,
and I don't want to do it anymore.

Person_9
Why?

Person_1
Why what?

Person_9
Why don't you want to do it anymore?

Person_1
...Because it hurts a little bit too
much.

Person_9
I told them you'd be there at five-thirty
tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I
drive back at eight. Either you'll be
outside or you won't.

Person_1
How did you find me?

Person_9
The house across from the library.

Side_27
Hi, Mia.                        Hi.

Side_28
I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.

Side_28
The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script.
Revision                        73.

Side_29
We want to build the character with you.
It's a process. Three-month rehearsal,
four-month shoot.

Person_1
...Ok.

Side_28
So why don't you just tell us a story?

Person_1
...About...?

Side_28
About anything.

Side_28
Whenever you're ready.

Person_1
My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She
used to tell me these stories, when I was
growing up, about living abroad...
I remember -- she told me she jumped into
the Seine once...

Person_9
When do you find out?

Person_1
They said the next couple of days... But
I'm not expecting to find anything out.

Person_9
You're going to get it.

Person_1
No, I'm not.

Person_9
You are. I know these things.

Person_1
Where are we?

Person_9
Griffith Park.

Person_1
I mean -- where are we?

Person_9
I know...
I don't know.

Person_1
What do we do?

Person_9
I don't think we can do anything. Because
when you get this --

Person_1
If I get this --
Revision                           75.

Person_9
When you get this -- you've got to give
it everything you've got.

Person_9
It's your dream.

Person_1
What are you going to do?

Person_9
I've got to follow my own plan. Stay
here. Get my own thing going. You know...

Person_9
You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz
there. And you love jazz now.

Person_9
Right?

Person_1
Right.

Person_9
I guess we're just going to have to wait
and see.

Person_1
You know I'm always going to love you.

Person_9
I'm always going to love you too.

Person_9
Look at this view.

Person_1
I've seen better.
Revision                         76.

Person_9
Agreed.

Person_1
I've never been here during the day.

Person_1
Hi... Iced coffee, please.

Side_30
On us.

Person_1
No, no, that's fine.

Person_9
Alright, I'm done.
Harris did a nice job with it.

Side_31
Took him long enough.

Person_9
No one touches the instruments. Carson's
coming an hour early to test levels.

Side_31
I got a check for you to sign.

Person_9
How'd we do last month?

Side_31
Not too bad.
Revision                          78.

Person_9
Not too bad is great.
(taps the Employee on the
shoulder)
See you tonight.

Side_31
See you tonight.

Side_32
King Seb!

Person_9
Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?

Side_32
Like the desert misses the rain.

Side_33
Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.

Person_9
Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?

Side_33
That's not Edgar.

Person_1
Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.

Side_34
Bye, Mrs. Dolan.

Side_35
What if we miss this? What do we tell
Natalie?
Revision                      80.

Person_1
We can just see it back in New York...

Person_1
Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off
here and get dinner?

Side_35
Alright...

Side_35
This looks fun.

Side_35
Come on...

Side_35
Mia?

Person_9
Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle
Bells".

Person_9
Welcome to Seb's.

Person_1
I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --

Side_36
Revision                           85.

Side_35
Do you want to stay for another?

Person_1
No... We should go.

Person_1
Goddamn bugs.

Person_1
Deja me hablar.

Person_2
Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
you comin' from?

Person_1
I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

Person_2
Sure you were. What do you say we have a
look at your catch?

Person_2
Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.
Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!

Person_2
What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
need --

Person_3
We'll take it from here.

Person_2
Who the hell are you?

Person_3
INS Division 6.

Person_2
Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

Person_3
Really?

Person_3
What're we thinking, Dee?

Person_4
Tough call, Kay.

Person_3
!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
Estados Unidos.
(Don't worry grandma.
Welcome to the United
States.)
A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
no? Buena suerta.
(Where are you going? San
Antonio?  Looking for
work, aren't you?  Good
luck.)
Es un placer verle aqui.
(It's a pleasure seeing
you here.)

Person_3
Que dices si te rompo la cara?
(What do you say if I
break your face?)

Person_3
No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
verdad, amigo?
(You don't speak a word
of Spanish, right, friend?)

Person_3
We got a winner.
Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
(The rest of you are free
to go. Scram!)

Person_2
Sir!

Person_3
Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.

Person_2
Sir, you can't just --

Person_3
Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
dealing with!

Person_3
We're gonna have a little chat with our
friend here. You boys can hit the road ...
and keep on protecting us from dangerous
aliens.

Person_2
You ever heard of Division 6?

Person_5
There is no Division 6.

Person_6
Who are those guys?

Person_3
I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
dollars to pesos that you're not --

Person_3
-- from anywhere near here.

Person_3
Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

Person_3
Political refugee. Right.

Person_4
You know how many treaty articles you've
just violated?

Person_3
One, my ass. Try seven.

Person_4
From unauthorized immigration to failure to
properly inoculate prior to landing.

Person_3
Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
put up your arms.

Person_3
Ah, shit.

Person_3
Dee! Shoot him!

Person_3
Dee, for Christ's --

Person_2
Th -- th -- th --

Person_3
"That."

Person_2
That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

Person_3
Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
you.

Person_3
Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
calm down. If you'll just give me your
attention for a moment I'll tell you what
happened.

Person_3
This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
some friends from out of town. The red eye
here isolates and measures the electronic
impulses in your brain. More specifically,
the ones for memory.

Person_3
Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
holes at 40, 60, and 80.

Person_5
What in the hell is going on?!

Person_3
Exactly the right question. And the answer
lies right -- here. Pay attention.

Person_7
Who are you, really?

Person_3
Really? I'm just a figment of your
imagination.

Person_3
God, we're a gullible breed.

Person_3
I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
alive after a blast like that.

Person_2
What -- blast?

Person_3
Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
to exercise more caution before discharging
your firearms.

Person_3
Especially you.

Person_4
I'm sorry. About...back there.

Person_3
Happens.

Person_4
Didn't used to.

Person_4
The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
me...

Person_4
They're beautiful, aren't they?

Person_3
What?

Person_4
The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

Person_3
No. You won't.

Person_8
Stop! NYPD!

Person_9
All yours, Edwards!

Person_8
Grand Central Station off to your left,
folks...

Person_8
Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
gear!

Person_8
Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

Side_1
He's coming! He's coming!

Person_8
And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
too.

Person_8
What the...

Person_8
Wassup?

Side_1
He's coming! He's coming because I failed,
and now he'll kill me too!

Person_8
Stop!

Side_1
You don't understand. Your world is gonna
end.

Person_8
What are you?!

Side_2
Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

Person_8
No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
again with another completely different set.

Side_3
Sort of a low beam, high beam.

Side_2
Was that before or after he drew the weapon
which you claim evaporated into a million
pieces?

Person_8
After, sir.

Side_2
And why do you suppose none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?

Person_8
'Cause some of the other officers are a
little soggy in the midsection. And they
couldn't keep up, sir.

Side_3
Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
am --

Person_8
What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

Side_3
What the hell is your problem?

Person_8
My problem is you being all up in my damn
face all the time.

Side_3
I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
minutes -- your best shot.

Side_2
Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
Now.

Person_8
You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
pudgy bastard.

Side_4
Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
believe you. I opened him up. Find me at
the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
found.

Person_8
Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

Side_4
You have really pretty eyes.

Side_4
Yes. That's right.

Person_3
Some night, huh?

Person_8
Oh, yeah, some night.

Person_3
They were gills.

Person_3
Not eyelids.

Person_8
Who are you?

Person_3
Did he say anything to you?

Person_8
Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
an end.

Person_3
Did he say when?

Person_8
You're kidding, right?

Person_3
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw
it again?

Person_8
Absolutely.

Person_3
Let's take a ride.

Person_8
Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

Person_3
It's all done.

Side_2
Good work, Edwards.

Person_3
You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
That's double tough.

Person_8
So who you with?

Person_8
You got the plain clothes, the
government-issued wheels. Secret Service?

Person_8
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
funding.

Person_3
Nothing is what it seems, kid.

Person_8
Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

Person_3
I'm part of a secret organization that
monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

Person_8
This is where we're going?

Person_8
Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
Doesn't even sell guns.

Person_3
Really?

Person_8
All right, you think it's worth shaking him
up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
answers.

Person_3
Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

Side_5
Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
proper authorities.

Person_8
Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

Side_5
Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
work here because I love the hours.

Person_8
I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
stuff.

Side_5
C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

Side_5
H-hiya Kay, how are you?

Person_3
The imports, Jeebs. Now.

Side_5
You know I got outta that business a long
time ago, Kay.

Person_3
Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
lie.

Side_5
Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

Person_3
I'm going to count to three.

Person_8
He'll do it, Jeebs.

Person_3
One.

Person_8
I've seen him do it.

Person_3
Two.

Person_8
Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
like this.

Side_5
He's always crazy.
Take a cruise. Get a massage --

Person_3
Three.

Person_8
Put down the gun and put your hands on the
counter!

Person_3
I warned him.

Person_8
Drop the weapon!

Person_3
You warned him.

Person_8
You are under arrest. You have the right to
remain silent.

Person_3
Will you relax?

Side_5
Do you know how much that hurts?

Person_3
Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
another one.

Person_3
Edwards?

Person_8
Uh, this. This is what I saw.

Person_3
You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

Side_5
He looked all right to me.

Person_3
A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
Who was the target?

Side_5
I don't know.

Person_3
Jeebs!

Side_5
I don't know!

Person_3
This is all confiscated. All of it. I want
you on the next transport off this rock. Or
I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

Person_8
Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

Person_8
The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

Person_3
Searching for a handle on the moment here?
A place to file all this.

Person_8
See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
grow back.
What's going on?

Person_3
Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
a thing.

Person_8
Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
long time.

Person_3
Ever see one of these?

Person_3
-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
but this one's eating my popcorn!

Person_8
Huh?

Person_3
Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

Person_8
Where am I?

Person_3
See what I mean about tequila? You're a
bright young man, James. Just lay off the
sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
sharp.

Side_6
Another beer?

Person_8
Coffee. Please.

Side_7
Figures.

Side_8
What is it, Edgar?!

Side_7
Get your big butt back in that house!

Side_7
You can have my gun when you pry it from my
cold, dead fingers!

Side_8
What on earth was it?!

Side_7
Sugar.

Side_8
I've never seen sugar do that.

Side_7
Give me sugar.

Side_7
In water.

Side_7
More.

Side_8
Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
hanging off your bones!

Side_7
That better?

Side_9
Help you?

Person_8
Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

Side_9
Elevator. Push the "call" button.

Side_10
You're late. Sit down.

Side_10
My name is Zed. You're all here because
you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

Side_10
And we're looking for one of you. Just one.
What will follow is a series of simple
tests designed to quantify motor skills,
hand-eye coordination, concentration,
stamina -- I see we have a question.

Person_8
Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
we doing this?

Side_10
Son?

Side_11
Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
honors. We're here because you're looking
for the best of the best of the best, sir!

Side_10
What's so funny, Edwards?

Person_8
I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
the best of the best of the best of the --"
(realizing nobody is with
him on this)
It just struck me as --
Humorous. Sir.

Side_10
Okay. Let's get going.

Person_8
Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
doing here?

Side_12
Looking for the best of the best of the best.

Person_8
Well, yeah, I know, but...

Side_10
The hell happened?

Person_8
Hesitated, sir.

Side_10
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany
deserved to die?

Person_8
She was the only one who actually seemed
dangerous. At the time.

Side_10
And how did you come to that conclusion?

Person_8
Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
not his head. His head is that butt-ugly
bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
the girl's books were way too advanced for
an eight-year-old's. And besides, from
where I'm looking, she was the only one who
appeared to have a motive. And I don't
appreciate your jumping down my throat about
it.

Person_8
Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

Side_10
He's got a real problem with authority.

Person_3
So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

Side_10
I hope you know what you're doing.

Side_10
Congratulations, you're everything we've
come to expect from years of government
training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
have one more test to administer, an eye
exam.

Person_8
You! Hey, what's goin' on?

Person_3
Back in the mid-fifties, the government
started a little underfunded agency with
the simple and laughable purpose of making
contact with a race not of this planet.

Side_10
Now, if you'll look directly at the end of
this device.

Person_3
Everybody thought the agency was a joke.
Except the aliens. They made contact on
March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

Person_3
There were nine of us that night. Seven
agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

Person_8
You brought the aliens flowers?

Person_3
They were intergalactic refugees with a
simple request. Let us use the earth as an
apolitical zone for people without a
planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
evidence of their landing.

Person_8
The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

Person_3
Why else would we hold it in Queens?
Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
They live among us, in secret.

Person_8
I see. Not to change the subject, but when
was your last cat-scan?

Person_3
Every six months; it's company policy.

Person_8
Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

Person_3
Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
while we're right here.

Person_3
Don't tell me we've only got that powdered
shit for cream again?

Person_3
Oh.

Person_3
For future reference, this is a better look
for you.

Person_3
Any given time, around fifteen hundred
landed aliens are on the planet, the
majority right here in Manhattan. Most
aliens are decent enough, just trying to
make a living.

Person_8
Cab drivers?

Person_3
Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
most part, don't have a clue. Don't want
one, either. They're happy. They think
they've got a pretty good bead on things.

Person_8
Why the big secret? People are smart, they
can handle it.

Person_3
A person is smart. People are dumb.
Everything they've ever "known" has been
proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
was the center of the universe. Five
hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
tomorrow.

Person_8
So what's the catch?

Person_3
What you'll gain in perspective, you'll
lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
You give up everything. Sever every human
contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

Person_8
Nobody?

Person_3
You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
There.  That's the speech I never heard.
That's the choice I never got.

Person_8
Hold up. You track me down, put me through
those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

Person_3
You got 'til sun-up.

Person_8
Is it worth it?

Person_3
You find out, you let me know.

Side_13
Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

Side_13
Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

Side_13
Takin' care of your pest problem.

Side_7
"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

Side_13
Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

Side_7
You know, I have noticed an infestation
here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
pond scum. So convinced of their own
superiority as they scurry about their
short, pointless lives.

Side_13
Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
'em?

Side_7
In the worst way.

Person_8
One thing you gotta know right now.

Person_8
All right. I'm in because there's some
next-level shit going on around here, and
I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
are a couple of things we need to get
straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
the skills. So as of now you can cease with
all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
"sport." Cool?

Person_3
Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

Person_3
As of this moment, they don't mean much.

Side_14
Purpose of trip?

Side_15
Diplomatic mission.

Side_14
Duration of stay?

Side_15
Lunch.

Side_14
Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

Person_3
Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

Person_3
A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
flight would get on anybody's nerves.

Person_8
What branch of the government do we report
to?

Person_3
None. They started asking too many questions.

Person_8
So who pays for all this?

Person_3
Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

Person_3
Here. A new recording device to replace
CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
again?
This is amusing. Universal translator.

Person_3
We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
you why.  Human thought is so primitive
it's considered an infectious disease.
Makes you proud, doesn't it?

Person_8
What's this?

Person_3
Don't touch that!

Person_3
Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
was funny as hell.

Person_8
Sorry!

Person_3
Observation, the heart of our little
endeavor.

Person_3
This map shows the location of every
registered alien on earth at any given
time. Some of them we keep under constant
surveillance.

Person_3
Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
public -- normal. In private -- you'll get
the idea.

Person_3
Meet the twins.

Person_8
I gotta be honest about something.

Person_3
It makes no sense?

Person_8
It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
from, like, Venus or something.

Person_3
Mrs. Edelson.

Person_3
Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

Side_10
What's your jacket size, Edwards?

Person_8
Uh -- forty regular.

Side_10
Then let's put it on.

Person_8
Put what on?

Side_10
The last suit you'll ever wear.

Side_16
The difference between you and me?

Side_16
I make this look good.

Side_10
Okay, let's see.
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
Sinalee touching down in the forest outside
Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

Side_17
Humanoid?

Side_10
You wish. Bring a sponge.
What else -- everybody, we gotta keep
Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

Side_10
Red-letter from last night -- we had an
un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
New York farm country. Keep your ears open
for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
galactic kegger down here.

Side_10
Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

Person_3
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

Side_10
Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
don't you take Jay? This is a good one for
him to warm up on.

Side_16
Yo, wussup with Zed?
"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger..."

Person_3
Zed was saving the world before you were
born, son. Show some respect.

Side_16
We got the use of unlimited technology from
the entire universe and we cruise around in
this?

Person_3
Seat belt.

Side_16
You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
people. You could be a little kinder and
gentler.

Person_3
Buckle up, please.

Side_16
Now did that hurt?

Person_3
Makin' fun of my ride...

Person_3
Jay. The button?

Side_16
Yeah?

Person_3
Never push the button, Jay.

Person_3
License and registration, please.

Person_3
Other license and registration, please.

Person_3
Your resident card has you restricted to
the five boroughs only. Where do you think
you're going?

Side_18
It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

Person_3
Oh God. How soon?

Person_3
Okay. All right. No big deal.
You handle it.

Side_16
Me?

Person_3
Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

Side_18
Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

Person_3
Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
you something.

Side_16
Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

Person_3
Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
You were headed out of town.

Side_18
Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

Side_16
Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
that?!

Person_3
So? Who you meeting?

Side_18
Well, it's -- a ship.

Person_3
Really? I didn't see a departure clearance
for today.

Side_18
You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

Side_16
Guys -- guys --

Person_3
Doin' fine, Ace.
What kind of emergency? What's the rush to
get off the planet all of a sudden?

Side_16
Help?! HELP! Hello?!

Side_18
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
Some of the -- new arrivals.

Person_3
What new arrivals? This have anything to do
with the crasher from last night?

Side_16
Can you guys do this later?!

Side_16
Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

Person_3
Congratulations! It's a lizard.

Side_16
Hey, you know, it is sorta --

Person_3
Anything about that seem unusual to you?

Side_16
Pick.

Person_3
What kind of "new arrival" would scare
Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?
Let's check the hot sheets.

Side_16
These are the hot sheets?

Person_3
Best damn investigative reporting on the
planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
York Times if you want. They get lucky
sometimes.

Side_16
You're actually looking for tips in a
supermarket tabloid?

Person_3
Not looking for. Found.

Person_3
Not so fast. Walk up slow.

Side_16
Why?

Person_3
Part of the routine. Makes it look like
we're sizing up the situation. Gives her
time to get the wrong impression.

Person_3
Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
smoother.

Side_8
Can I help you gentlemen?

Person_3
How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
few questions about your visitor.

Side_8
Are you here to make fun of me too?

Person_3
No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense
of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we
come in?

Side_8
Sure. Lemonade?

Side_8
And they said to me, "If he was murdered,
how could he walk back in the house?" And I
must admit, I was a little stumped by that
one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
It was more like something else that was
wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

Side_16
Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
alien...

Side_8
Sorry?

Person_3
Go on.

Side_8
Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

Person_3
Did he say anything?

Side_8
Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
remember.

Person_3
Sugar water.

Side_16
Did you taste her lemonade?

Person_3
Ray Bans.
(pulling off Jay's
sunglasses)
Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the
flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was
trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
the light from Venus --

Side_16
Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
give her a new one?

Person_3
Standard issue neuralyzer.

Side_16
And that's the best you can come up with?

Person_3
On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar
ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at
your mother's for a few days and get over
it. Decide you're better off.

Side_16
Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked
him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
decorator or something...

Side_16
Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those
memory things?

Person_3
When you're ready.
Please -- not green.

Person_3
Do you know what alien life form leaves a
green spectral trail?

Side_16
Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
question on Final Jeopardy last night.

Person_3
Zed, we have a bug.

Side_16
I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
that this is bad. Right?

Person_3
Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They
consume, infest and destroy. They live off
the death and decay of other species.

Side_16
So basically you have a racial problem with
all insect-based life forms?

Person_3
Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
five times smarter than Albert Einstein,
four times stronger than an ox, nine times
meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
around Manhattan Island in his brand new
Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

Side_16
What do we do?

Person_3
With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

Side_19
Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
planet are terrible.

Side_15
Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

Side_19
Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

Side_15
Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
the planet.

Side_19
A bug? He must know why I'm here.

Side_15
We think he does.
(noticing the ornate box
on the table)
Is that what I think it is?

Side_19
No, just some diamonds for your children.
Do we have time to eat?

Side_15
Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

Side_20
Table six is up!

Side_15
To the continued reign of the Arquillian
Empire.

Side_19
To the safety of the galaxy.

Side_19
You can kill us both -- but you will not
find it.

Side_7
You're right about one thing.

Person_9
What am I supposed to do with the cat?

Side_2
I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
family claim it.

Person_9
Where do you want contestant number three?

Side_4
By the wall, I guess.
What's with the cat?

Person_9
Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

Side_4
What's the problem with the cat?

Person_9
Your problem.

Side_4
Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
His is worse.

Side_4
Okey-dokey. Shall we?

Side_4
Oh, my God.

Side_4
...approximately 112 degrees at time of
autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a
post-mortem increase in body temperature.
Examiner attempted to verify result
rectally, only to find subject was, uh,
without rectum. Which can only be described
as...well...as really...

Side_4
Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
going to need to see some ID.

Side_4
You boys must not have much of a home life.

Person_3
We watch the morgues very carefully. You've
got something unusual?

Side_4
I'd say so -- triple homicide.

Side_4
The first corpse was perfectly normal,
except that he was broken in half, but when
I opened up the other two -- well, look.

Side_4
There's a skeletal structure at work here
unlike anything I've ever seen.

Person_3
I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
other body?

Side_4
This way, Doctor.

Side_4
This one's even stranger. I did a full
laparotomy. I started with the lesser
curvature of the stomach -- though, if you
want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal
junction.

Side_16
I think, uh, we should start at the same
place you did.

Side_4
All right.

Side_16
Your cat?

Side_4
Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

Side_4
Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't
mind.

Side_4
You have very pretty eyes.

Side_16
Thank-you, but is this really the time to
uh -- you know, come on to me?

Side_4
Hey, just walking the dog.
Feel that? Where the piloric junction would
be?

Side_16
Oh, yes. Exactly.

Side_4
Now push that aside. Notice anything
strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

Side_16
Nope. All fine.

Side_4
Doctor, they're all missing.

Side_16
Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing
out is that there are no pieces of them
left. So they're intact, wherever they are.
That we can be sure of.

Side_4
Have we met before? I have the strangest
feeling of deja vu.

Side_16
You know, I was just going to ask you the
same thing.

Side_4
Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's
already under enough stress.
This body is not really a body, but it's
actually some sort of transport unit for
something else altogether. The question is:
what?

Side_4
By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

Side_16
No, no...not at all.

Side_4
You know what I like to do sometimes? When
it's really late?

Side_16
No...

Side_16
Excuse me.

Person_3
What do you think?

Side_16
Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
Undead thing goin' on.

Person_3
Of the body.

Side_16
Great body.

Person_3
The dead body?

Side_16
Not a clue.

Person_3
All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to
sound too dumb.

Side_4
Dr. White.

Side_4
Dr. White.
Dr. White.

Side_4
Person_3
You're up, Slugger.

Side_4
Look at this.

Side_16
What is that?

Side_4
Far -- freaking -- out.

Side_21
Must -- to pre -- prevent --
-- contest? No...to prevent --

Side_16
It's all right -- What are you trying to
say? Struggle?

Side_4
War?

Side_21
Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --
What is word? Be...?

Side_16
Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

Side_16
"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's
Belt?"  The hell does that mean?
Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come
here!

Side_4
"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the
Department of Public Health, are you?

Side_16
He's dead.

Person_3
Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

Side_16
You knew him?

Person_3
One of the few I actually liked. Exiled
High Prince.

Side_4
I was right -- this is an alien life form,
and you're from some government agency who
wants to keep it under wraps...

Side_16
He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on
Orion's Belt."

Side_4
... This make total sense. How else do you
explain New York? The other night I'm in a
cab, this guy...

Person_3
He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?
That makes no sense.

Side_16
That's what he said.
Didn't he? Right after he --
Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy
thing already.

Side_4
Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid
I'm going to need to see some ID if you're
going to be in the morgue, okay?

Person_3
Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

Side_16
Stop that --

Person_3
Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

Side_16
-- that thing probably gives you brain
cancer!

Person_3
Never hurt her before.

Side_16
"Never hurt her before"?! How many times
have you done the flashy thing to this poor
woman?!

Person_3
Couple.

Side_16
Aren't you worried about, you know, long
term damage?

Person_3
Little bit.

Side_16
What the hell happened to make you such a
callous son of a bitch?

Person_3
I took this job.

Side_16
Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,
did you?

Person_3
Nah.

Side_16
Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in
charge of the flashy memory thing
department.

Person_3
Not while I'm around, Slim.

Side_16
Yeah, well you're a menace with that
thing...

Person_3
We've got two dead aliens in there, and a
deputy medical coroner in need of a new
memory.

Side_7
No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

Side_16
Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around
here?

Side_10
The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
psychotic episode.

Side_10
Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of
stars in the northern sky...
and here's Orion's belt --

Side_16
That's what the little guy was talking
about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
Orion's belt..."

Side_10
There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
belt is just these three stars; galaxies
are huge, made up of billions of stars.
(switches off the laser
pointer)
You heard wrong.

Side_16
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

Side_22
Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

Side_16
Pretty lady...

Side_16
Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
ever get married?

Person_3
No.

Side_23
Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

Side_16
Well, it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have --

Person_3
Try it.

Person_3
They're leaving.

Side_10
We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the beginning.

Side_16
What do they know that we don't know?

Person_3
Why do rats desert the ship?
Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
of Manhattan.

Person_3
Four hundred.

Person_3
Four thousand.

Person_3
That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

Side_16
And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

Person_3
Message coming in.

Person_3
Speak of the devil.

Side_16
They sound pissed.

Side_10
Translate that and step on it!
Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
see what you can turn up.

Side_10
And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

Side_16
I like that.

Person_3
Series four de-atomizer.

Person_3
Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

Side_16
You get a series four de-atomizer and I get
a "Noisy Cricket?!"
I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

Side_7
That's my truck!

Person_1
And make sure you tell them that at the
impound.

Person_1
I got worse.

Side_16
Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
jewels?

Person_3
Someone who's not looking for jewels.

Side_16
This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

Side_16
Kay! GET DOWN!

Side_16
The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
from the picture! That's him!

Person_3
Damn it.

Person_3
We do not discharge our weapons in view of
the public.

Side_16
Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
the world if we don't...

Person_3
There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
plague about to wipe out life on this
planet, and the only thing that lets people
get on with their hopeful little lives is
that they don't know about it.

Person_3
Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
town. We've got his ship.

Person_3
Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

Side_10
Containment may be a moot point, my friend.
The exodus continues. It's like the party's
over and the last one to leave gets stuck
with the check.

Side_10
You sorry little ingrates!

Side_10
We've only translated a part of the message
so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

Side_10
Oh, it gets better... They're holding us
responsible.

Side_10
Another contestant has entered the ring.

Person_3
All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
need help. A professional. Someone with
years of experience in intergalactic
politics. I just hope the little prick
hasn't skipped town.

Side_7
Where do you keep your dead?

Side_24
I don't have any dead.

Side_7
Where?!

Side_24
I don't know, the city morgue!

Side_16
Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

Side_25
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry
little butt.

Person_3
You busy, Frank?

Side_25
Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my
ride's leaving in --

Person_3
Call the pound. We got a stray.

Side_25
Hey! Get your paws off me!

Side_16
The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

Person_3
Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

Side_25
I know nothing.

Person_3
Not a thing?

Side_25
Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
a galaxy. They thought he would be safe
here on earth.

Person_3
And the bug had other plans.

Side_25
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic
energy in the universe. If the bugs get
their slimy claws on it, kiss the
Arquillians goodbye.

Side_16
Ask him about the belt.

Person_3
Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,
Frank?

Side_25
Beats me.

Side_16
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

Side_25
The galaxy is here.

Person_3
Here?

Side_16
The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
and planets? How's it here?

Side_25
You humans, when're you gonna learn that
size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's
important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
small.

Person_3
How small?

Side_25
Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked
before the flight.

Person_3
Get out of here.
The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

Side_16
Kay...

Side_4
Boy, when you want attention --

Side_4
What's this?

Side_4
Wow.

Side_16
So two galaxies have been fighting for
years. And the only people who've been
benefiting are a race of creatures called
bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make
peace...and the bugs send this guy down to
make sure the fighting never stops.

Person_3
By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
galaxy they've been fighting about.

Side_16
And if we don't get it back before he
leaves the planet...we're history.

Person_3
We're not even history. 'Cause history
implies there's someone around to remember
it.

Side_26
Thank you for making sure the bell works.

Side_26
What's up, Farmer John?

Side_7
A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

Side_26
And this means what to me?

Side_7
He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
believe he had an animal with him. A gift
I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
me. I would like it back.

Side_26
I'll need a picture ID, written proof of
ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
kinship with --

Side_26
-- the deceased.

Side_7
Don't -- do that.

Side_26
Do what?

Side_26
Shit!

Side_16
I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

Person_3
What the hell for?

Side_16
Because all we have to do is walk in and
get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you
go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on
her and flash your brain ray in her face
and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
some shit. The woman's a doctor, she
doesn't need you erasing half her med
school classes. Take me five minutes.

Person_3
Two minutes!

Side_7
Where is the animal?!

Side_4
I told you, I don't know, it ran under some
equipment! Over there.

Side_7
Get it!

Side_16
Uh, hi.

Side_4
Hello.

Side_16
I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
precinct. They brought a cat in here with a
corpse the other day, might have said
"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

Side_4
Yes. That's right.

Side_16
Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
witness in a murder case and I'm going to
need to take it with me.

Side_4
I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

Side_16
You don't?

Side_4
No.
(lowers her voice to a
whisper)
Maybe you could take me with you instead.

Side_16
Excuse me?

Side_4
I said, maybe you could take me with you
instead.

Side_16
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

Side_4
I'd really like to go with you. Now.

Side_16
And, uh, why exactly is that?

Side_4
I just do.

Side_4
I have something I need to show you.

Side_16
Now slow down, you don't have to hit the
gas like that.

Side_4
You don't understand. You really need to
see this.

Side_16
And I will. But we gotta get something
straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
I'm used to doing things, okay?

Side_4
Look, Stud, I don't know how many more
times I'm going to get to tell you this.
There's something --

Side_4
-- that you have to help me with.

Person_3
Freeze it, Bug!

Side_16
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

Side_4
CHRIST, are you THICK!

Side_16
How was I supposed to know!?!

Side_4
What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

Side_16
Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
prom date!

Side_4
Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
shows the slightest hint of sexual
independence, men just --

Side_7
Everybody shut UP!

Person_3
Let her go, Shit Eater.

Side_7
Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
right?!

Person_3
You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
to your left and I'll solve all your
problems.

Side_7
That's better. Now put down your weapons.
We're leaving.

Side_7
Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

Side_7
Would you care to see the fly get even?

Person_3
How far you think you'll get without your
ship? If that's what you call that hunk of
space crap we've got back at our office.

Side_7
Put the weapons down!

Person_3
Never gonna happen, Insect.

Side_16
It's okay, Laurel!

Side_4
HOW is it okay?!

Side_16
I mean it's going to be okay!

Side_7
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

Person_3
Damn it!

Side_7
Take me here.

Side_4
What???

Side_16
They're in a cab.

Side_16
Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

Person_3
Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the
planet in a cab.

Person_3
Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's
not leaving the island.

Person_3
What've we got from our friends upstairs?

Side_10
Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

Person_3
Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
we've got his ship. He's got to be looking
for a way out.

Side_10
Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
have a galactic standard week to respond.

Side_16
A galactic standard week? How the hell long
is that?

Person_3
One hour.

Side_16
One hour?

Side_10
To keep the bugs from getting it, the
Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and
whatever planet it's on.

Side_16
You're talking about US!

Side_10
Sucks, doesn't it?

Person_3
Pull up the locations of all land-based
interstellar vehicles.

Side_10
They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
last ship on the planet.

Person_3
Atlantic City?

Side_10
Gone.

Person_3
That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

Side_10
Gone.

Side_16
Uh, gentlemen.

Person_3
Epcot?

Side_10
Gone.

Person_3
Miami Beach?

Side_10
Gone.

Side_16
Fellas.

Person_3
Hartford?

Side_10
Gone, thank God.

Side_16
Hey. Old guys.

Side_16
Do those still work?

Side_7
You're coming with me.

Side_4
What?! Why?!

Side_7
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

Person_3
Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

Side_16
You're taking the tunnel?!

Person_3
You know a better way to Queens?

Side_16
It's usually jammed?!

Side_16
I told you!

Person_3
Jay. The button?

Side_16
Yeah?!

Person_3
Push the button, Jay.

Person_3
And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

Person_3
Mind if I smoke?

Side_16
What?!?

Person_3
In the car, I mean.

Side_16
I don't care!!

Person_3
Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
some people if you smoke in a car.

Person_3
Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
should quit. I've tried. Never took,
though. I'm beginning to think I lack
self-control.

Person_3
Well, back to work.

Side_4
Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
me. I'm a very important person on my
planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me, yes. I'm
not trying to impress you with this, I'm
just letting you know. It could start a
war.

Side_7
Good. War means food for my family, all
seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
of mouths to feed, your highness.

Side_4
You're a wonderful dad.

Side_16
You know how to work that?

Person_3
No idea whatsoever.

Person_3
Let's bag us some bug.

Side_16
Oh, shit.

Person_3
Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
implosion factor --

Side_16
What?

Person_3
Press the little green button, on three.

Person_3
One...two...

Side_7
You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

Person_3
You are under arrest for violating number
4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
over any galaxy you might be carrying.

Side_7
You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
few seconds you won't even be matter!

Person_3
Move away from the vehicle and put your
hands on your head.

Side_7
Put my hands on my head?

Side_27
Like this?

Side_16
That did not go at all like I had planned.

Person_3
This guy's really starting to bug me.

Person_3
Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
that ship.

Side_16
Where are you going?

Person_3
Getting my gun back.

Side_16
What!?

Person_3
Hey, Bug!

Person_3
I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

Person_3
You're just a smear on the sports page to
me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
parasite! Eat me!

Side_16
Hey! Come over here and try that!

Side_16
Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on
your waxy, pointed ass!

Side_16
What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
and fight like an arthropod!

Side_16
You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
you're a badass in your hive, but this is
New York City. You're just another tourist
here!

Side_16
You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

Side_16
Hey, Bug!

Side_16
If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
yours.

Side_16
Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

Side_16
What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
'Help me! Help me!'

Side_16
Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
that is!

Side_27
Don't do that!

Side_16
That's your Momma!

Side_16
Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
more than you can chew?

Side_16
You son of a --

Person_3
Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
have the galaxy.

Side_10
I think the word's already out. Our friends
are coming back.
Got an authorized landing at Times Square.
You and Jay check it out on the way back...
And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
celebrating.

Person_3
You were saying?

Side_16
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

Person_3
Worked.

Side_16
After I got the shit beat out of me!

Person_3
And I almost got digested. It goes with the
job.

Side_16
You coulda told me what you were doing.

Person_3
There wasn't time, sport!

Side_4
Interesting job you guys got.

Person_1
Damn bugs.

Side_16
Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
don't have to flashy thing her.

Side_16
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
hangs out with dead people.

Person_3
Not her. Me.
They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
I never just look anymore and they're
beautiful.

Side_16
Kay, you're scaring your partner.

Person_3
I haven't been training a partner -- I've
been training a replacement.

Side_16
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

Side_4
Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
We're not even on the right island.

Person_3
Maybe you won't have to.

Person_3
Days. Months. Years. Always face it
forwards.

Person_3
I've just been down the gullet of an
interstellar cockroach. That's one of a
hundred memories I don't want.

Person_3
See you around, sport.

Side_16
No, you won't.

Side_28
Side_29
Side_30
And here's another one:
Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel
And a third:
Returns to Girl He Left Behind

Side_31
Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
Bulls game.

Side_16
I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
planet.

Side_31
Let's roll.

Person_1
"Adventure is out there!"

Person_1
Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster
of Paradise Falls!

Person_2
Ooh!
Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

Person_3
No!

Person_1
I promise to capture the beast...
alive!

Person_1
And I will not come back until I do!
The crowd CHEERS.

Person_4
It's a beautiful day, winds out of
the east at ten knots.
Visibility... unlimited.
Enter the weather in the logbook!

Person_4
Oh! There's something down there!
I will bring it back for science.
Awwww, it's a puppy!

Person_4
What are you doing!?!

Person_4
Don't you know this is an exclusive
club? Only explorers get in here.
Not just any kid off the street
with a helmet and a pair of
goggles. Do you think you got what
it takes? Well, do you?!?

Person_4
Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard.
She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed.

Person_4
What's wrong? Can't you talk?
Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens.

Person_4
Hey, I don't bite.
She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all
directions.
She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and
pins it on Carl.

Person_4
You and me, we're in a club now.

Person_4
I saw where your balloon went.
Come on, let's go get it!

Person_4
My name's Ellie.

Person_4
There it is.

Person_4
Well, go ahead.
She pushes him out onto the beam.

Person_4
Go on.

Person_3
Ow!

Person_4
Hey kid!!

Person_3
Ow!!

Person_4
Thought you might need a little
cheerin' up. I got somethin' to
show ya!

Person_4
I am about to let you see something
I have never shown to another human
being. Ever. In my life.
Carl's eyes widen in alarm.

Person_4
You'll have to swear you will not
tell anyone.
Carl nods.

Person_4
Cross your heart. Do it!
Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils...

Person_4
My Adventure Book!
It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"
written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.

Person_4
You know him.
Carl smiles excitedly.

Person_4
Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get
big, I'm going where he's going:
South America.
She turns the page to a map.

Person_4
It's like America... but south.
Wanna know where I'm gonna live?

Person_4
"Paradise Falls, a land lost in
time." I ripped this right out of
a library book.

Person_4
I'm gonna move my clubhouse there,
and park it right next to the
falls. Who knows what lives up
there? And once I get there...

Person_4
Well, I'm saving these pages for
all the adventures I'm gonna have.
Only... I just don't know how I'm
gonna get to Paradise Falls.
Ellie closes the book, disappointed.

Person_4
That's it! You can take us there
in a blimp! Swear you'll take us.
Cross your heart! Cross it! Cross
your heart.

Person_4
Good. You promised. No backing out.

Person_4
Well, see you tomorrow kid!   Bye.

Person_4
"Adventure is out there!!"

Person_4
You know, you don't talk very much.
I like you.

Person_3
Wow.

Person_5
Quite a sight, huh Ellie?
Uhp, mail's here.

Person_5
Shady Oaks Retirement.    Oh brother.

Person_5
Hm.

Person_6
Hey! `Morning, Mr. Fredricksen!
Need any help there?

Person_5
No. Yes. Tell your boss over there
that you boys are ruining our house.

Person_6
Well just to let you know, my boss
would be happy to take this old
place off your hands, and for
double his last offer. Whaddya say
to that?
The leaf blower blasts off his hat.

Person_6
Uh, I take that as a no, then.

Person_5
I believe I made my position to
your boss quite clear.

Person_6
You poured prune juice in his gas tank.

Person_5
Oh yeah, that was good. Here, let
me talk to him.

Person_5
You in the suit. Yes, you.      Take a
bath, hippy!

Person_6
I am not with him!
This is serious. He's out to get
your house!

Person_5
Tell your boss he can have our house.

Person_6
Really?

Person_5
When I'm dead!
Carl SLAMS the door.

Person_6
I'll take that as a maybe!

Person_7
"Good afternoon. My name is
Russell. And I am a Wilderness
Explorer in Tribe 54, Sweatlodge
12. Are you in need of any
assistance today, sir?"

Person_5
No.

Person_7
I could help you cross the street.

Person_5
No.

Person_7
I could help you cross your yard.

Person_5
No.

Person_7
I could help you cross your... porch?

Person_5
No.

Person_7
Well, I gotta help you cross
something.

Person_5
Uh, no.   I'm doing fine.

Person_7
"Good afternoon. My name is
Russell."

Person_5
Uh... kid...

Person_7
"And I am a Wilderness Explorer in
Tribe 54, Sweatlodge 12."

Person_5
Kid.   KID!!

Person_7
"Are you in need of any assistance
today Sir?"

Person_5
Thank you, but I don't need any help!

Person_7
Ow.

Person_7
"Good afternoon. My-"

Person_5
But skip to the end!

Person_7
See these? These are my Wilderness
Explorer badges. You may notice
one is missing. It's my Assisting
the Elderly badge. If I get it I
will become a Senior Wilderness
Explorer!
Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his
fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

Person_7
"The wilderness must be explored!

Person_7
It's gonna be great! There's a big
ceremony, and all the dads come,
and they pin on our badges...

Person_5
So you want to assist an old
person?

Person_7
Yep! Then I will be a Senior
Wilderness Explorer!
Carl leans in close to Russell.

Person_7
Snipe?

Person_5
Bird. Beady eyes. Every night it
sneaks in my yard and gobbles my
poor azaleas. I'm elderly and
infirm. I can't catch it. If only
someone could help me...

Person_7
Me! Me!   I'll do it!

Person_5
Oh, I don't know, it's awfully
crafty. You'd have to clap your
hands three times to lure it in.

Person_7
I'll find it, Mr. Fredricksen!

Person_5
I think its burrow is two blocks
down. If you go past --

Person_7
Two blocks down! Got it!

Person_7
Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey...

Person_5
Bring it back here when you find
it!
Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

Person_8
Okay, keep her coming... And...
stop. Stop! STOP!!
The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.

Person_5
What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you
think you're doing?

Person_8
I am so sorry, sir...

Person_5
Don't touch that!

Person_8
No no, let me take care of that for you.

Person_8
Hey sir, I...

Person_5
I don't want you to touch it!
Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk.
The worker rubs his head.    Blood.

Person_9
Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't
seem like a public menace to me.
Take this.

Person_9
The guys from Shady Oaks will be by
to pick you up in the morning, okay?
The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.

Person_5
What do I do now, Ellie?

Person_5
Morning gentlemen.

Side_1
Good morning, Mr. Fredricksen.    You
ready to go?

Person_5
Ready as I'll ever be. Would you
do me a favor and take this?

Person_5
I'll meet you at the van in just a
minute. I... want to say one last
goodbye to the old place.

Side_1
Sure.   Take all the time you need, sir.

Side_2
Typical. He's probably going to the
bathroom for the eightieth time.

Side_1
You'd think he'd take better care
of his house.

Person_5
So long boys! I'll send you a
postcard from Paradise Falls!

Person_5
We're on our way, Ellie.
Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings
tied to the grate.
He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes
and smiles.
SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.

Person_5
Huh?

Person_5
Hm.

Person_7
Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me,
Russell.

Person_5
What are you doing out here, kid?

Person_7
I found the snipe and I followed it
under your porch, but this snipe
had a long tail and looked more
like a large mouse.

Person_7
Please let me in?

Person_5
No.

Person_5
Oh, alright, you can come...
Russell runs into the house past Carl.

Person_5
...in.

Person_7
Huh. I've never been in a floating
house before.

Person_7
Goggles.   Look at this stuff!
Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of
the open atlas.

Person_7
Wow, you going on a trip?
"Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in
Time." You going to South America,
Mr. Fredricksen?
Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.

Person_5
Don't touch that.   You'll soil it.

Person_7
You know, most people take a plane,
but you're smart because you'll have
all your TV and clocks and stuff.
Russell runs over to the steering rig.

Person_7
Whoah.   Is this how you steer your
house?   Does it really work?

Person_5
Kid, would you stop with the --
Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and
forth.

Person_7
Oh, this makes it go right, and
that way's left.

Person_5
Let go of the -- knock it off!
Russell looks out the window in front of him.

Person_7
Hey look, buildings!

Person_7
That building's so close I could
almost touch it.

Person_7
Wow! This is great! You should try
this, Mr. Fredricksen! Look, there's
a bus that could take me home two
blocks away!
Hey, I can see your house from here!

Person_5
Don't jerk around so much, kid!

Side_3
Carl stands beside Russell at the window.    Russell's fall had
been a daydream.

Person_5
Well, that's not gonna work.

Person_7
I know that cloud, it's a Cumulo
Nimbus. Did you know that the
Cumulo Nimbus...

Person_5
Stayed up all night blowing up
balloons, for what?

Person_7
...warm air goes by cool air, and
the airs go by each other and
that's how we get lightning.

Person_5
That's nice, kid.

Person_7
Mr. Fredricksen, there's a big
storm coming. It's starting to get
scary. We're gonna get blown to
bits! We're in big trouble, Mr.
Fredricksen!

Person_5
What are you doing over there?

Person_7
Look!

Person_7
See?    Cumulo Nimbus.

Person_7
My pack!

Person_7
Got ya!

Person_7
Whew!    I thought you were dead.

Person_5
Wha... what happened?

Person_7
I steered us. I did!      I steered
the house!

Person_5
Steered us?

Person_7
After you tied your stuff down you
took a nap, so I went ahead and
steered us down here.

Person_5
Huh?

Person_5
Can't tell where we are.

Person_7
Oh we're in South America all
right. It was a cinch, with my
Wilderness Explorer GPS.

Person_5
GP-what?

Person_7
My dad gave it to me. It shows
exactly where we are on the planet.
With this baby, we'll never be lost!
Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.

Person_7
Oops.

Person_5
We'll get you down, find a bus
stop. You just tell the man you
want to go back to your mother.

Person_7
Sure, but I don't think they have
busses in Paradise Falls.

Person_5
There. That ought to do it. Here,
I'll give you some change for bus fare.

Person_7
Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass.

Person_7
Mr. Fredricksen, how much longer?

Person_5
Well, we're up pretty high.   Could
take hours to get down.
Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward.

Person_7
What was that, Mr. Fredricksen?

Person_5
We can't be close to the ground yet.

Person_5
Wait, wait! No don't, don't, don't!

Person_5
Whoah!   Hey, hey!
Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them
to the ground.

Person_5
Russell, hang on!
Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.

Person_7
Whoah!
They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is
thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.

Person_5
Walk back!     Walk back!

Person_7
Okay!

Person_5
Where... where are we?

Person_7
This doesn't look like the city or
the jungle, Mr. Fredricksen.
The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.

Person_5
Don't worry, Ellie. I got it.
The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,
flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

Person_5
There it is. Ellie, it's so
beautiful.

Person_5
We made it. We made it! Russell,
we could float right over there.
Climb up. Climb up!

Person_7
You mean assist you?

Person_5
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

Person_7
Okay, I'll climb up!

Person_5
Watch it.

Person_7
Sorry.
The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.

Person_5
Now, when you get up there, go
ahead and hoist me up! Got it?!

Person_5
You on the porch yet?!

Person_5
What? That's it?! I came all this
way just to get stuck at the wrong
end of this rock pile? Aw, great!

Person_7
Hey, if I could assist you over
there, would you sign off on my
badge?

Person_5
What are you talking about?

Person_7
We could walk your house to the
falls!

Person_5
Walk it?

Person_7
Yeah, after all, we weigh it down.
We could walk it right over there.
Like a parade balloon.
Carl considers this.

Person_5
Now, we're gonna walk to the falls
quickly and quietly, with no rap
music or flash-dancing.
Russell inspects his surroundings.

Person_5
We have three days, at best, before
the helium leaks out of those
balloons. And if we're not at the
falls when that happens...

Person_7
Sand!

Person_5
...we're not getting to the falls!

Person_7
I found sand!

Person_5
Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get
our house over there.
Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?

Person_7
Huh.
This is fun already, isn't it? By
the time we get there, you're gonna
feel so assisted... Oh, Mr.
Fredricksen, if we happen to get
separated, use the Wilderness
Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!!

Person_7
Wait. Why are we going to Paradise
Falls again?

Person_5
Hey, let's play a game. It's
called: "See who can be quiet the
longest."

Person_7
Cool!   My mom loves that game!

Person_5
Darn thing.
C'mon, Russell, would you hurry it up?

Person_7
I'm tiiiired. And my knee hurts.

Person_5
Which knee?

Person_7
My elbow hurts and I have to go to
the bathroom.

Person_5
I asked you about that five minutes
ago!

Person_7
Well, I didn't have to go then!
Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.

Person_7
I don't want to walk anymore.     Can
we stop?

Person_5
Russell! If you don't hurry up,
the tigers will eat you.

Person_7
There's no tigers in South America.
Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.

Person_7
Zoology.

Person_5
Oh, for the love of Pete. Go on into
the bushes and do your business.

Person_7
Okay!   Here, hold my stuff.

Person_7
I've always wanted to try this!

Person_5
Eugh!   None of my concern!
Beat.

Person_7
Huh?  Tracks?!

Person_7
Here, snipe... Come on out, snipe.
Snipe!
The footprints continue for a time, then stop.

Person_7
Huh.
Russell munches on a chocolate bar.

Person_7
Ha! Gotcha!

Person_7
Don't be afraid, little snipe. I
am a Wilderness Explorer so I am a
friend to all of nature. Want some
more?

Person_7
Hi boy.    Don't eat it all.   Come on
out.

Person_7
Come on. Don't be afraid little
snipe. Nice snipe. Good little
snipe. Nice...
A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.

Person_7
...giant snipe!

Person_7
I found the snipe!

Person_5
Oh, did you?

Person_7
Are they tall?

Person_5
Oh yes, they're very tall.

Person_7
Do they have a lot of colors?

Person_5
They do indeed.

Person_7
Do they like chocolate?

Person_5
Oh ye-   Chocolate?

Person_5
What is that thing?!

Person_7
It's a snipe!

Person_5
There's no such thing as a snipe!

Person_7
But you said snipes eat--

Person_7
Whoah!
Russell GIGGLES.

Person_5
Go on, get out of here. Go on!
Shoo!

Person_5
Careful, Russell!

Person_5
Russell!
The bird grooms Russell.

Person_5
Get out of here.    Go on, git!

Person_5
Aaaah!

Person_7
Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's
okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice!

Person_5
"Kevin"?

Person_7
Yeah, that's his name I just gave
him.

Person_5
Hey. Beat it! Vamoose! Scram!

Person_5
Hey!   That's mine!

Person_5
Aaah!   Shoo, shoo! Get out of here.

Person_5
Go on, beat it.

Person_7
Can we keep him? Please?? I'll
get the food for him, I'll walk
him, I'll change his newspapers...

Person_5
No.

Person_5
That doesn't even rhyme.

Person_7
Yeah it does.
Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.

Person_7
Hey, look!     Kevin!

Person_5
What? Get down! You're not
allowed up there!

Person_5
You come down here right now!

Person_5
Sheesh!   Can you believe this, Ellie?

Person_7
Ellie?

Side_4
Uh, hey Ellie, could I keep the
bird? Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
She said for you to let me.

Person_5
But I told him no --
I told you no! N-O.
The bird HISSES at Carl.

Person_5
I see you back there!

Person_5
Go on, get out of here. Shoo! Go
annoy someone else for a while.

Person_5
Uh, hello?

Person_5
Oh!   Hello sir!    Thank goodness.

Person_5
It's nice to know someone else is
up here!

Side_5
I can smell you.

Person_5
What?    You can smell us?

Side_5
I can smell you.

Person_5
Hey.

Person_7
You were talking to a rock.
Russell points to another rock shape.

Person_7
Hey, that one looks like a turtle!

Person_7
Look at that one!     That one looks
like a dog!
The "rock" walks forward.

Person_7
It is a dog!

Person_5
What?

Person_7
Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs
in my apartment.
The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.

Person_7
Hey, I like dogs!

Person_5
We have your dog!
Wonder who he belongs to?

Person_7
Sit boy.

Person_7
Hey look, he's trained!    Shake!

Person_7
Uh-huh.    Speak.

Side_6
Hi there.

Person_5
Did that dog just say "Hi there?"

Side_6
Oh yes.
Carl JUMPS back.

Side_6
My name is Dug. I have just met
you and I love you.

Person_5
Uh..wha?

Side_6
My master made me this collar. He
is a good and smart master and he
made me this collar so that I may
talk -- SQUIRREL!!
Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm.

Side_6
My master is good and smart.

Person_5
It's not possible.

Side_6
Oh it is, because my master is
smart.

Person_7
Cool! What do these do, boy?

Side_6
Hey would you-

Person_5
Russell, don't touch that. It could
be radioactive or something.
Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.

Side_6
I am a great tracker. My pack sent
me on a special mission all by
myself. Have you seen a bird? I
want to find one and I have been on
the scent. I am a great tracker,
did I mention that?
BAM!   The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.

Side_6
Hey, that is the bird! I have
never seen one up close but this is
the bird.
May I take your bird back to camp
as my prisoner?

Person_5
Yes! Take it! And on the way,
learn how to bark like a real dog!

Side_6
Oh I can bark!
Dug BARKS.

Side_6
And here's howling!
Dug HOWLS.    The bird HISSES at Dug.

Person_7
Can we keep him? Please please
please?

Person_5
No.

Person_7
But it's a talking dog!

Person_5
It's just a weird trick or
something. Let's get to the falls.

Side_6
Please be my prisoner. Oh please oh
please be my prisoner.

Side_7
Oh, here it is.    I picked up the
bird's scent!

Side_8
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What
is this? Chocolate. I smell
chocolate.

Side_7
I'm getting prunes and denture
cream! Who are they?

Side_8
Ah man, Master will not be pleased.
We'd better tell him someone took
the bird, right Alpha?
ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.

Side_9
No. Soon enough the bird will be
ours yet again.

Side_9
Find the scent, my compadres and
you two shall have much rewardings
from Master for the toil factor you
wage.

Side_8
Hey Alpha, I think there's
something wrong with your collar.
You must have bumped it.

Side_7
Yeah, your voice sounds funny!
Beta and Gamma LAUGH.   Alpha turns.   They stop laughing.

Side_9
Beta. Gamma. Mayhaps you desire
to -- SQUIRREL!

Side_9
Mayhaps you desire to challenge the
ranking that I have been assigned
by my strength and cunning?

Side_8
No no. But maybe Dug would.     You
might want to ask him.

Side_7
Yeah, I wonder if he's found the
bird on his very special mission.

Side_9
Do not mention Dug to me at this
time. His fool's errand will keep
him most occupied, most occupied
indeed. Ha ha ha. Do you not
agree with that which I am saying
to you now?

Side_8
Sure, but the second Master finds
out you sent Dug out by himself,
none of us will get a treat.

Side_9
You are wise, my trusted
Lieutenant.

Side_9
This is Alpha calling Dug.   Come
in, Dug.

Side_6
Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds
funny.

Side_9
I know, I know!   Have you seen the
bird?

Side_6
Why yes, the bird is my prisoner
now.

Side_7
Yeah, right.

Side_9
Impossible! Where are you?!

Side_6
I am here with the bird and I will
bring it back and then you will
like me. Oh, gotta go.
On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a
boy's face. It's Russell.

Person_7
Hey Dug! Who you talking to?

Side_8
What's Dug doing?

Side_7
Why's he with that small mailman?

Side_8
Where are they?

Side_9
There he is. Come on!

Side_6
Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my
prisoner!

Person_7
Dug, stop bothering Kevin!

Side_6
That man there says I can take the
bird and I love that man there like
he is my master.

Person_5
I am not your master!

Side_6
I am warning you, once again, bird!

Person_7
Hey!     Quit it!

Side_6
I am jumping on you now, bird.

Person_5
Russell! At this rate we'll never
get to the falls!

Person_5
I am nobody's master, got it?
I don't want you here,
...and I don't want you here.
I'm stuck with you. And if you two
don't clear out of here by the time
I count to three-
Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.

Side_6
A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball!

Person_5
Ball?
Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.

Person_5
You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah?

Side_6
Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so
want the ball!

Person_5
Go get it!!
Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.

Side_6
Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and
then bring it back!

Person_7
Why?

Person_5
Just give it to me!
Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.

Person_5
Bird.   Bird!
Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.

Person_5
C'mon Russell!

Person_7
Wait.   Wait, Mr. Fredricksen.

Person_5
Daah!

Person_5
Aaahh...

Person_7
What are we doing?

Person_7
Hey, uh, we're pretty far now.
Kevin's gonna miss me.

Person_5
I think that did the trick.

Side_6
Hi, Master.

Person_5
Afternoon.
Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.

Person_5
Well, thanks for keeping us dry
anyway, Ellie.

Person_7
Is this step three, or step five?
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.

Person_7
There!
Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into
place.

Person_7
All done.
Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.

Person_7
That's for you!

Person_7
Awh.   Tents are hard.

Person_5
Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness
Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges?

Person_7
Yeah, but... can I tell you a
secret?

Person_5
No.

Person_7
Alright, here goes. I never
actually built a tent before.
There. I said it.

Person_5
You've been camping before, haven't
you?

Person_7
Well, never outside.

Person_5
Well, why didn't you ask your Dad
how to build a tent?

Person_7
I don't think he wants to talk
about this stuff.

Person_5
Why don't you try him sometime?
Maybe he'll surprise you.

Person_7
Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see
him much.

Person_5
He's got to be home sometime.

Person_7
Well, I called, but Phyllis told me
I bug him too much.

Person_5
Phyllis? You call your own mother
by her first name?

Person_7
Phyllis isn't my mom.
Carl realizes he put his foot in it.

Person_5
Oh.

Person_7
But he promised he'd come to my
Explorer ceremony to pin on my
Assisting the Elderly badge, so he
can show me about tents then,
right?

Person_5
Hey, uh, why don't you get some
sleep. Don't want to wake up the
traveling flea circus.

Person_7
Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants
to take Kevin prisoner. We have to
protect him!

Person_7
Can Kevin go with us?

Person_5
Alright.   He can come.

Person_7
Promise you won't leave him?

Person_5
Yeah.

Person_7
Cross your heart?

Person_5
Cross my heart.

Person_5
What have I got myself into, Ellie?

Person_5
Morning Sweetheart.

Person_5
We better get moving.

Person_5
Huh. Bird's gone. Maybe Russell
won't notice.
Alright, everybody up!

Person_7
Where's Kevin? He's wandered off!
Kevin! Dug, find Kevin!

Side_6
Find the bird.    Find the bird...

Side_10
Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.

Person_7
Oh, look! There he is.

Side_10
The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.

Person_5
Hey, that's my food!   Get off my
roof!

Side_6
Yeah, get off of his <>!

Person_5
What is it doing?

Side_6
The bird is calling to her babies.

Person_7
Her babies! Kevin's a girl?
The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.

Side_6
Her house is over there in those
twisty rocks.
Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.   The
baby birds call from somewhere inside.

Side_6
She has been gathering food for her
babies and must get back to them.

Person_7
Wait, Kevin's just leaving? But
you promised to protect her!

Person_7
Her babies need her, we gotta make
sure they're together.

Person_5
Sorry Russell. We've lost enough
time already.

Person_7
Yeah...

Person_7
This was her favorite chocolate.
Because you sent her away, there's
more for you.
Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.

Person_5
Huh?

Person_7
Kevin?

Side_9
Where's the bird? You said you had
the bird.

Side_6
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Since I have
said that, I can see how you would
think that.

Side_9
Where is it?

Side_6
Uh, tomorrow. Come back tomorrow
and then I will again have the
bird. Yes.

Side_9
You lost it. Why do I not have a
surprised feeling? Well, at least
you now have lead us to the small
mailman and The One Who Smells of
Prunes.

Side_9
Master will be most pleased we have
found them, and will ask of them
many questions.
Come!

Person_5
Wait, we're not going with you.
We're going to the falls!
Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.

Person_5
Get away from me! Get down!

Side_5
You came here in that?

Person_5
Uh... yeah.

Side_5
In a house? A floating house?
The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.

Side_5
That is the darndest thing I've
ever seen! You're not after my
bird, are you? But if you need to
borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy
to oblige!
The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.

Side_5
Well, this is all a misunderstanding.
My dogs made a mistake.

Person_5
Wait, are you Charles Muntz?!

Person_1
Well... Yes.

Person_5
The Charles Muntz?

Person_1
"Adventure is out there!"

Person_5
It's really him!
That's Charles Muntz!

Person_5
Him!

Side_11
Yes!    It is him! He is!

Person_5
I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and
I, we were your biggest fans!

Person_1
Well, you're a man of good taste!

Person_1
You must be tired.     Hungry?

Person_7
Uh-huh.

Person_1
Attention everyone! These people
are no longer intruders. They are
our guests.

Side_11
Follow me! I like you temporarily.
You do smell like prunes. I will
not bite you.

Person_5
Wow.

Person_1
Go ahead and moor your airship
right next to mine.

Person_5
We're not actually going inside the
"Spirit of Adventure" itself?!

Person_1
Oh.    Would you like to?

Person_5
Would I?!?!

Person_5
Wait up, Mr. Muntz!

Person_5
Jiminy Cricket.

Side_8
Not you.

Side_7
What do we do with Dug?

Side_9
He has lost the bird.     Put him in
the Cone of Shame.

Side_6
I do not like the Cone of Shame.

Person_1
Most of the collection is housed in
the world's top museums: New York,
Munich, London... `Course I kept
the best for myself.

Person_5
Did you ever! Will you look at that?

Person_1
Oh yes, the Arsinoitherium. Beast
charged while I was brushing my
teeth. Used my shaving kit to
bring him down.
A dog approaches carrying a menu.    Muntz waves it off.

Person_1
Oh, surprise me.
Only way to get it out of Ethiopia
at the time was to have it declared
as "dental equipment!"
Muntz LAUGHS.   Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one
of the bones.

Person_5
Oh my gosh, the Giant Somalian
Leopard Tortoise!

Person_1
Oh, you recognize it? I'm
impressed! That's an interesting
story there...

Person_1
Hm, excellent choice.
I found it on safari with
Roosevelt.
Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.
POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.

Person_1
He and I fell into a habit of
playing gin rummy in the evenings.
And did he cheat? Oh, he was
horrible!

Side_9
Master, dinner is ready.

Person_1
Oh dear, broken translator.   It's
that loose wire again.
There you go big fella.

Side_9
Thank you Master.
Russell reacts.

Person_7
I liked his other voice.
Muntz LAUGHS.

Person_1
Well, dinner is served!    Right this
way.

Person_1
So how are things stateside?
Almost tempted to go back a few
times, but I have unfinished work
here... Please.
Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place
napkins on their laps.

Person_1
I hope you're hungry because
Epsilon is the finest chef I've
ever had.
Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove
the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look
delicious.

Person_1
Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again!

Person_7
Yes!!
Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and
eats a bite.

Person_7
Hey!

Person_7
Hey!

Person_5
Oh my Ellie would have loved all
this. You know, it's because of
you she had this dream to come down
here and live by Paradise Falls.

Person_1
I'm honored. And now you've made
it!

Person_5
You're sure we're not a bother?
I'd hate to impose.

Person_1
No no! It's a pleasure to have
guests -- a real treat.

Side_11
Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat!

Person_1
No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm
down...
In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

Person_7
Hey!

Side_12
Shouldn't've used that word...
Having guests is a delight. More
often I get thieves, come to steal
what's rightfully mine.

Person_5
No!

Person_1
They called me a fraud, those...
dah! But once I bring back this
creature, my name will be cleared.
The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,
feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.

Person_1
Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a
lifetime tracking it. Sometimes
years go by between sightings...

Side_1268.
I've tried to smoke it out of that
deathly labyrinth where it lives...
Can't go in after it. Once in,
there's no way out. Lost so many
dogs...
Muntz is lost in reverie.

Person_1
And here they come, these bandits,
and think the bird is theirs to
take! But they soon find that this
mountain is a very dangerous
place.

Person_7
Hey, that looks like Kevin!

Person_1
"Kevin?"

Person_7
Yeah! That's my new giant bird
pet. I trained it to follow us.

Person_1
Follow you? Impossible.      How?

Person_7
She likes chocolate.

Person_1
Chocolate?

Person_7
Yeah, I gave her some of my
chocolate. She goes ga-ga for it.

Person_5
But it ran off!      It's gone now.

Person_1
You know, Carl. These people who
pass through here, they all tell
pretty good stories. A "Surveyor"
making a map.
Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.   It
rolls across the floor.

Person_1
A "Botanist" cataloguing plants.

Person_1
An old man taking his house to
Paradise Falls.

Person_1
That's the best one yet. I can't
wait to hear how it ends.
Carl glances around nervously.

Person_5
Well! It's been a wonderful
evening, but we'd better be going.

Person_1
Oh, you're not leaving?

Person_5
We don't want to take advantage of
your hospitality. Come on Russell.

Person_7
But we haven't even had dessert
yet.

Person_1
No, the boy's right. You haven't
had dessert. Epsilon here makes a
delicious Cherries Jubilee.

Person_1
Oh, you really must stay. I
insist! We have so much more to
talk about!

Person_7
Kevin?
Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he
sees THE BIRD.

Person_1
It's here.
He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

Person_1
Get them!

Person_5
Hurry!

Person_7
I am hurrying!

Person_7
They're coming!

Side_6
Go toward the light, master!
Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

Person_5
Russell!

Person_5
Get back!!
Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains
down! The dogs stop short.

Side_6
Go on Master!       I will stop the
dogs!
Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

Side_6
Stop you dogs!!

Person_7
Help! Help!

Person_5
Gimme your hand!
Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl
PULLS him back onto the bird.
Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time
to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds
100 feet below.

Person_7
Hang on to Kevin!

Person_7
No no no! Kevin! Stay down.
She's hurt real bad. Can't we help
her get home?

Person_5
Alright.   But we've got to hurry.

Person_1
You lost them?

Side_8
Uh, it was Dug.

Side_7
Yeah, he's with them.    He helped
them escape!

Person_1
Wait.   Wait a minute.   Dug...

Person_5
See anything?

Side_6
No, my pack is not following us!
Boy they are dumb.
Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house
from behind a tree canopy.

Person_5
This is crazy. I finally meet my
childhood hero and he's trying to
kill us! What a joke.

Side_6
Hey, I know a joke. A squirrel
walks up to a tree and says I
forgot to store acorns for winter
and now I am dead. Ha! It is funny
because the squirrel gets dead.
They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

Person_5
Careful Russell.
The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the
porch.

Person_7
You okay, Kevin?
Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

Person_7
You know what, Mr. Fredricksen?
The wilderness isn't quite what I
expected.

Person_5
Yeah?   How so?

Person_7
It's kinda... wild. I mean, it's
not how they made it sound in my
book.

Person_5
Hmm, get used to that, kid.

Person_7
My dad made it sound so easy. He's
really good at camping, and how to
make fire from rocks and stuff. He
used to come to all my Sweatlodge
meetings.

Person_7
And afterwards we'd go get ice
cream at Fentons. I always get
chocolate and he gets butter-
brickle. Then we'd sit on this one
curb, right outside, and I'll count
all the blue cars and he counts all
the red ones, and whoever gets the
most, wins. I like that curb.
He looks up at Carl.

Person_7
That might sound boring, but I
think the boring stuff is the stuff
I remember the most.
They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

Person_7
Look, there it is!

Person_5
Hold on Russell, stand still!

Person_5
Look at that bird go!

Person_5
Wait up, you overgrown chicken!

Person_7
That's it, go Kevin!      Go find your
babies!

Person_7
Run Kevin! Run!

Person_7
Oh no!

Person_5
Russell, give me your knife!

Person_5
No!

Person_7
No!
Carl pulls his house away from the flames.

Person_1
Careful. We want her in good shape
for my return.

Person_7
Let her go! Stop!

Person_7
Kevin!
Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes
the flames.

Person_7
You gave away Kevin.   You just gave
her away.

Person_5
This is none of my concern.      I
didn't ask for any of this!

Side_6
Master.   It's alright.

Person_5
I am not your master! And if you
hadn't a shown up, none of this
would have happened! Bad dog! Bad
dog!

Person_5
Now, whether you assist me or not,
I am going to Paradise Falls if it
kills me.

Person_7
I don't want this anymore.
Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone.

Side_12LOVE, ELLIE."
Carl smiles.

Person_5
Russell?

Person_5
Russell!

Person_7
I'm gonna help Kevin even if you
won't!

Person_5
No, Russell! No!
Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift
it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons
have lost too much helium.

Side_3
The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,
dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

Person_5
Wahhoo!

Person_5
Russell?

Person_5
Dug!

Side_6
I was hiding under your porch
because I love you. Can I stay?

Person_5
Can you stay? Well, you're my dog
aren't you? And I'm your master!

Side_6
You are my master?!
Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.

Side_6
Oh boy.     Oh boy!

Person_7
Ooph!

Person_7
Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save -
Growling dogs move toward him.

Person_1
And they wouldn't believe me. Just
wait till they get a look at you.

Side_9
Master! The small mailman has
returned.

Person_1
What?

Person_7
Let me go!

Person_1
Where's your elderly friend?

Person_7
He's not my friend anymore.

Person_1
Well, if you're here, Fredricksen
can't be far behind.

Person_7
Where are you keeping Kevin!?

Person_7
Let me go!

Side_8
Scream all you want, small mailman.

Side_7
None of your mailman friends can
hear you.

Person_7
I'll unleash all my Wilderness
Explorer training!

Person_1
Alpha! Fredricksen's coming back.
Guard that bird. If you see the
old man, you know what to do.

Person_7
Hey, where are you going?    I'm not
finished with you!

Person_1
Nice talking with you.

Person_1
Where are you, Fredricksen?

Person_5
Russell!
Carl steers his house to the dirigible.

Person_7
Mr. Fredricksen!

Person_5
Dug!   Bring `er over!
Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to
the dirigible ramp.

Person_7
You came back for Kevin!     Let's go
get her.

Person_5
I'm getting Kevin.    You stay here!

Person_7
But I want to help!

Person_5
I don't want your help.     I want you
safe!
Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.

Person_5
How do we get past these dogs?

Side_6
Uh... POINT!
Dug points to a grate in the wall.

Person_5
Kevin!

Person_5
Don't worry Kevin, we're on our
way!
Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck
into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.

Side_9
Allow no one to be entering through
these doors. Guard well that bird,
my minions.

Person_5
Who wants the ball?

Side_12DOGS
Me! I do! I want the ball!

Person_5
Then go get it!
Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it.

Side_12DOGS
I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna
get the ball! I'm gonna get it!

Side_7
I got it!!

Side_7
Uh-oh.

Person_5
I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out
of here.

Side_11
Master! He's gone! The old man!
He's here! He's got the bird! The
bird's gone!

Person_1
What?    Calm down!   One at a time!

Person_7
I want to help!
He manages to get his arms free.

Person_7
Ha ha!

Side_11
He's in Hall D! He's in Hall B!
It's the old man!

Person_1
Does anyone know where they are?!?!

Person_7
Whoooaaah!

Person_1
Grey leader! Take down the house!

Side_8
Grey leader, checking in.

Side_7
Grey 2, checking in.

Side_12OMEGA
Grey 3, checking in.
The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house.

Side_8
Target sighted.
The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy
that fires poison darts.

Person_5
Come on, Kevin.

Side_6
Hi.

Side_12OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!
Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.
His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.
Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis
balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.

Person_1
Any last words, Fredricksen?   Come
on, spit it out!
Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.    He falls backwards.

Person_5
Come on!

Person_1
Enough! I'm taking that bird back
with me alive or dead!
Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal
the final blow.

Person_5
Come on, Kevin!

Side_9
I will have many enjoyments for
what I am about to do, Dug.

Side_12MISC DOG
He wears the Cone of Shame!

Side_9
What? Do not just continue
sitting! Attack!

Side_9
No! No! Stop your laughing! Get
this off of me!

Side_6
Listen you dog!     Sit!
Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too.

Side_11
Yes, Alpha.

Side_6
Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is-

Person_7
I can't do it!

Person_5
Russell!

Person_7
Huh?

Person_7
You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone!

Person_7
Hey!
Squirrel!

Side_7
Squirrel?

Side_12OMEGA
Where's the squirrel?!

Side_7
I hate squirrels.

Person_5
Dug!
Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.

Side_6
Master!
The house bears down on them.    They run to meet it.

Person_5
Russell!! Over here!!    Let's go!

Person_7
Mr. Fredricksen!

Person_5
Come on, Kevin!
Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself...

Person_5
No!

Person_5
Russell!   Get out of there!
Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.

Person_5
No!    Leave them alone!

Person_5
Russell! Hang on to Kevin! Don't
let go of her!

Person_5
Kevin!   Chocolate!

Person_7
That was cool!
Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird
holds on to the hose with her beak.
Carl LAUGHS, relieved.

Person_5
Don't jerk around so much, kid!
Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.

Side_6
Oh I am ready to not be up high.
Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.
Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats
softly down into the clouds, and disappears.

Person_7
Sorry about your house, Mr.
Fredricksen.

Person_5
You know, it's just a house.
Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship
floating off over the clouds.

Person_5
Ow! Ow! Ow!

Person_7
Look at you. You're so soft.

Person_7
I wish I could keep one.

Person_5
Huh, where's my cane?      I just had
it here...
Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane.

Person_5
You know what? Keep `em.       A little
gift from me to you.
The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.

Person_7
Bye Kevin!
The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one
last time before disappearing into the mist.

Person_7
Ready?
Carl gives a thumbs up.

Person_5
Ready!

Side_12CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
...and by receiving their badges,
the following Explorers will
graduate to Senior Explorers.

Side_12CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
For Extreme Mountaineering Lore...
Congratulations, Jimmy.
For Wild Animal Defensive Arts...
Congratulations, Brandon.
For Assisting the Elderly...
Russell is tanned and dirty.   And alone.

Side_12CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
Uh, Russell? Is there... someone
that... uh...

Person_5
I'm here for him.

Side_12CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
Congratulations, Russell. Sir...

Person_5
Russell, for assisting the elderly,
and for performing above and beyond
the call of duty, I would like to
award you the highest honor I can
bestow: The Ellie Badge.

Person_7
Wow.

Side_12CAMP MASTER STRAUCH
Alright, I think that covers
everybody... So let's give a big
Explorer Call to our brand new
Senior Wilderness Explorers! Ready
everybody?
The Camp Master leads the audience in the WILDERNESS EXPLORER

Person_7
Blue one.

Person_5
Red one.

Side_6
Grey one.

Person_5
Red one.

Person_7
That's a bike!

Person_5
It's red, isn't it?

Person_7
Mr. Fredricksen, you're cheating.

Person_5
No, I'm not. Red one.

Person_7
That's a fire hydrant.

Person_5
Maybe I need new glasses.

Person_1
Blood, blood, blood!

Person_1
And death.

Person_1
Back then, the world was divided in
two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.

Person_1 (O.S.)
But over time, we evolved, and
moved beyond our primitive savage
ways.

Person_1
Now, predator and prey live in
harmony.

Person_1
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

Person_3
Yeah, I don't have to cower in a
herd anymore.

Person_3
Instead I can be an astronaut.

Person_4
I don't have to be a lonely hunter
any more.

Person_5
Today I can hunt for tax
exemptions. I'm gonna be an
actuary!

Person_1
And I can make the world a better
place! I am going to be...

Person_1
A police officer!

Person_6
Bunny cop. That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

Person_1
It may seem impossible to small
minds--
I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.

Person_1
But just 211 miles away stands the
great city of Zootopia! Where our
ancestors first joined together in
peace, and declared that anyone can
be anything! Thank you and good
night!

Person_7
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

Person_1
Nope.

Person_7
Well, we gave up on our dreams and
we settled, right Bon?

Person_8
Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We
settled hard.

Person_7
See, that's the beauty of
complacency, Jude. If you don't try
anything new, you'll never fail.

Person_1
I like trying, actually.

Person_8
What your father means, hon, is
it's gonna be difficult--
impossible even-- for you to become
a police officer.

Person_7
Right. There's never been a bunny
cop.

Person_8
No.

Person_7
Bunnies don't do that.

Person_8
Never.

Person_7
Never.

Person_1
Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be
the first one. Because I am gonna
make the world...
(parkours against a
vendor's stand)
A better place!

Person_7
OR... um, heck, you wanna talk
about making the world a better
place--

Person_7
--no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

Person_8
Yes! Your dad, me, your 275
brothers and sisters-- we're
changing the world.

Person_7
Yep.

Person_8
One carrot at a time...

Person_7
Amen to that. Carrot farming is a
noble profession.

Person_8
You get it. I mean, it's great to
have dreams.

Person_7
Yeah, just as long as you don't
believe in em too much.
(finally noticing Judy's
absence)
Where in the heck'd she go?

Person_6
Gimme your tickets right now, or
I'm gonna kick your meek little
sheep butt.

Person_9
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

Person_6
Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?

Person_1
You heard her. Cut it out.

Person_6
Nice costume, loser. What crazy
world are you living in where you
think a bunny could be a cop?

Person_1
Kindly return my friends' tickets.

Person_6
Come and get `em.... But watch out,
`cause I'm a fox-- and like you
said in your dumb little stage
play, us predators used to eat
prey. And that killer instinct's
still in our Dunnahh.

Side_1
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's
pronounced D-N-A.

Person_6
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

Person_1
You don't scare me, Gideon.

Person_6
You scared now?

Side_1
Lookit her nose twitch. She is
scared!

Person_6
Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --

Person_6
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do
ya?

Person_6
I want you to remember this moment--
the next time you think you will
ever be anything more than just a
stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.

Side_2
That looks bad.

Person_9
Are you okay, Judy?

Person_1
Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.

Person_1
Here you go.

Person_9
Wow! You got our tickets!

Side_2
You're awesome, Judy!

Person_9
Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talkin' `bout.

Person_1
Well, he was right about one
thing...

Person_1
I don't know when to quit.

Side_3
Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city
limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara
Square, Rainforest District, to
name a few. You're gonna have to
master all of them before you hit
the streets-- or guess what?
You'll be dead!

Side_3
Scorching sandstorm. You're dead,
bunny bumpkin!

Side_3 (O.S.)
1000 foot fall. You're dead, carrot
face!

Side_3
Frigid ice wall. You're dead, farm
girl!

Side_3
E-normous criminal.

Side_3
You're dead!

Side_3 (O.S.)
Dead! / Dead! / Dead!

Side_3
Filthy toilet. You're dead, fluff
butt!

Side_5
As Mayor of Zootopia, I am proud to
announce that my Mammal Inclusion
Initiative has produced its first
police academy graduate.

Side_5
Valedictorian of her class, ZPD's
very first rabbit officer... Judy
Hopps.

Side_5
Assistant Mayor Bellwether? Her
badge.

Side_6
Oh! Yes right.

Side_5
Thank you.

Side_5
Judy, it is my great privilege to
officially assign you to the heart
of Zootopia: Precinct One, City
Center.

Side_6
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

Side_7
I won't let you down. This has been
my dream since I was a kid.

Side_6
Ya know, it's a... It's a real
proud day for us little guys.

Side_5
Bellwether, make room will ya? Come
on.

Side_5
Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see
those teeth!

Person_8
We're real proud of you, Judy.

Person_7
Yeah. Scared, too.

Person_8
Yes.

Person_7
Really, it's kind of a proud-scared
combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so
far a away... It's such a big city.

Side_7
Guys-- I've been working for this
my whole life.

Person_8
We know. And we're just a little
excited for you, but terrified.

Side_7
The only thing we have to fear is
fear itself.

Person_7
And also bears. We have bears to
fear, too. To say nothing of lions,
and wolves...

Person_8
Wolves?

Person_7
...weasels...

Person_8
You play cribbage with a weasel.

Person_7
And he cheats like there's no
tomorrow. You know what, pretty
much all predators-- and Zootopia's
full of `em.

Person_8
Oh, Stu.

Person_7
And foxes are the worst.

Person_8
Actually, your father does have a
point there. It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon
Grey.

Side_7
When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a
jerk, who happened to be a fox. I
know plenty of bunnies who are
jerks.

Person_7
Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case, we made you a
little care package to take with
you.

Person_8
And I put some snacks in there.

Person_7
This is fox deterrent.

Person_8
Yeah that's safe to have there.

Person_7
This is fox repellent...

Person_8
Okay, the deterrent and the
repellent. That's all she needs.

Person_7
Check this out!

Person_8
Oh for goodness sake. She has no
need for a fox taser, Stu.

Person_7
Oh c'mon. When is there not a need
for a fox taser?

Side_7
Okay, look-- I will take this to
make you stop talking.

Person_7
Terrific! Everyone wins!

Side_8
Arriving-- Zootopia Express!

Side_7
OK. Gotta go. Bye!

Side_7
I love you guys.

Person_8
Love you, too!

Person_7
Oh cripes, here come the
waterworks.

Person_8
Oh Stu, pull it together.

Side_7
Bye everybody!

Side_9
Bye, Judy! I love you!

Side_10
Bye!

Side_7
Bye!

Side_11
MEADOWLANDS, SAHARA SQUARE, etc.

Side_12
I am Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia!

Side_13
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin
Arms. "Luxury Apartments with
Charm."

Side_13
Complimentary de-lousing once a
month.
Don't lose your key.

Side_14
Thank you!

Side_14
Oh hi, I'm Judy! Your new neighbor!

Side_15
Yeah? Well we're loud.

Side_16
Don't expect us to apologize for
it.

Side_14
Greasy walls... rickety bed...

Side_14
Crazy neighbors...
(big smile as she flops on
the bed)
I love it!

Side_17
C'mon! He bared his teeth first.

Side_18
O-M goodness! They really did hire
a bunny. What?!

Side_18
I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be.

Side_14
Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny
"cute," but when other animals do
it, it's a little...

Side_18
I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin
Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks
is just a flabby, donut-loving cop,
stereotyping you...?

Side_14
It's okay-- oh, you've actually
you've actually got a-- there's a--
in your neck-- the fold-- the--
there's--

Side_18
Oh, there you went, you little
dickens!

Side_14
I should get to roll call, so...
which way do I?

Side_18
Oh! Bullpen's over there to the
left.

Side_14
Great, thank you!

Side_18
Aw... That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

Side_14
Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to
make the world a better place?

Side_19
All right, all right. Everybody
sit.

Side_19
I've got three items on the docket.
First... we need to acknowledge the
elephant in the room.
Francine, happy birthday.

Side_19
Number two: There are some new
recruits with us I should
introduce. But I'm not going to,
because I don't care. Finally...

Side_19
...We have 14 missing mammal cases.
All predators, from a giant polar
bear, to a teensy little otter. And
City Hall is right up my tail to
find them. This is priority number
one. Assignments!

Side_19
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer,
Delgato-- your teams take Missing
Mammals from the Rainforest
District. Officers McHorn,
Rhinowitz, Wolfard, your teams take
Sahara Square. Officers Higgins,
Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And
finally, our first bunny, Officer
Hopps.

Side_19
Parking Duty. Dismissed!

Side_14
Parking duty?
Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?

Side_14
Sir, you said there were 14 missing
mammal cases?

Side_19
So.

Side_14
So I can handle one. You probably
forgot, but I was top of my class
at the academy.

Side_19
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

Side_14
Sir, I'm not just some "token"
bunny.

Side_19
Well, then writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.

Side_14
100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write
100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200
tickets!

Side_14
Before noon!

Side_14
Boom! 200 tickets before noon.

Side_14
Where'd he go...

Side_20
Listen, I don't know what you're
doing skulking around during
daylight hours, but I don't want
any trouble in here... So hit the
road.

Side_21
I'm not looking for any trouble
either, sir. I simply want to buy a
Jumbo Pop for my little boy.

Side_21
You want the red or the blue, pal?

Side_14
I'm such a...

Side_20
Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen,
buddy, what? There aren't any fox
ice cream joints in your part of
town?

Side_21
Uh, no no, there are. There are.
It's just, my boy--
--this goofy little stinker-- he
loves all things elephant. Wants to
be one when he grows up.

Side_21
Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am
I to crush his little dreams, huh?
Right?

Side_20
Look, you probably can't read, fox
but the sign says...

Side_20
Side_22
(slowly reads SIGN,
belittling)
SERVICE TO ANYONE. So beat it.

Side_23
You're holding up the line.

Side_20
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, metermaid.

Side_14
Actually...
I'm an officer. Just had a quick
question. Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucous
with their cookies and cream?

Side_20
What are you talkin' about?

Side_14
Well, I don't wanna cause you any
trouble, but I believe scooping ice
cream with an un-gloved trunk is a
Class 3 Health Code Violation...

Side_14
...Which is kind of a big deal. Of
course-- I could let you off with a
warning if you were to glove those
trunks and, I don't know, finish
selling this nice dad and his son
a... what was it?

Side_21
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

Side_14
A Jumbo Pop.

Side_20
Fifteen dollars.

Side_21
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't
have my wallet. I'd lose my head if
it weren't attached to my neck,
that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry
pal. Gotta be about the worst
birthday ever. Please don't be mad
at me.
Thanks, anyway.

Side_14
Keep the change.

Side_21
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind, really, can I pay you
back?

Side_14
Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know,
it burns me up to see folks with
such backward attitudes toward
foxes. I just wanna say, you're a
great dad and just a... a real
articulate fella.

Side_21
Ah, well, that is high praise. It's
rare that I find someone so non-
patronizing... Officer...

Side_14
Hopps. Mr...

Side_21
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

Side_14
And you little guy, you want to be
an elephant when you grow up... you
be an elephant-- because this is
Zootopia, anyone can be anything.

Side_21
Ah, boy, I tell him that all the
time. All right here ya go--
Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that
smile, that's a happy birthday
smile! All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot toot.

Side_14
Toot, toot!

Side_21
Bye now!

Side_14
Goodbye!

Side_14
Oh! Hey, little toot toot--

Side_21
Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles!

Side_21
Lumber delivery!

Side_24
What's with the color?

Side_21
The color? Uh... It's redwood.

Side_21
39...40. There you go. Way to work
that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss
bye-bye for daddy?

Side_25
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite
your face off. Ciao.

Side_14
Well. I stood up for you, and you
lied to me. You liar!

Side_21
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar, he is.

Side_14
Hey!

Side_14
Alright, slick Nick, you're under
arrest.

Side_21
Really, for what?

Side_14
Gee I don't know, how `bout selling
food without a permit, transporting
undeclared commerce across borough
lines, false advertising...

Side_21
Permit. Receipt of declared
commerce. And I didn't falsely
advertise anything. Take care.

Side_14
You told that mouse the popsicle
sticks were redwood!

Side_21
That's right. "Red wood." With a
space in the middle. Wood that is
red.
You can't touch me, Carrots, I been
doing this since I was born.

Side_14
You're gonna wanna refrain from
calling me Carrots...

Side_21
My bad. I just naturally assumed
you came from some little carrot-
choked podunk, no?

Side_14
Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke
County, and I grew up in
Bunnyburrow.

Side_21
Okay. Tell me if this story sounds
familiar:
Nave little hick with good grades
and big ideas decides, "Hey lookit
me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia--
where Predators and Prey live in
harmony and sing Kumbaya!" Only to
find-- whoopsie, we don't all get
along. And that dream of becoming a
big city cop? Double whoopsie!
She's a meter maid. And whoopsie
number threesie-- NO ONE cares
about her or her dreams. And soon
enough those dreams die and our
bunny sinks into emotional and
literal squalor living in a box
under a bridge. Til finally she has
no choice but to go back home with
that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become-- you're
from Bunnyburrow, is that what you
said?-- so how `bout a carrot
farmer... That sound about right?

Side_21
Be careful now, it won't just be
your dreams getting crushed.

Side_14
Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I
can or can't be! Especially not
some jerk who never had the guts to
try to be anything more than a
popsicle hustler!

Side_21
Alright look, everyone comes to
Zootopia thinking they can be
anything they want. Well you can't.
You can only be what you are.
Sly fox.

Side_21
Dumb bunny.

Side_14
I am NOT a dumb bunny.

Side_21
Right. And that's not wet cement.

Side_21
You'll never be a real cop. You're
a cute meter maid though. Maybe a
supervisor one day. Hang in
there...

Side_14
Oh hey, it's my parents!

Person_8
Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!

Person_7
Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was
your first day on the force?

Side_14
It was real great.

Person_8
Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

Side_14
Mmm. Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice. And I feel like
I'm really making a difference--

Person_7
Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes,
Bonnie! Look at that!

Person_8
Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you
a meter maid?

Side_14
Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is
just a temporary thing--

Person_8
It's the safest job on the force!

Person_7
Ah, she's not a real cop! Our
prayers have been answered!

Person_8
Glorious day!

Person_7
Meter maid, meter maid!

Side_14
Dad! Dad--

Person_7
Meter maid, meter maid!

Side_14
DAD! You know what-- it's been a
really long day, I should really--

Person_8
That's right. You get some rest!

Person_7
Those meters aren't gonna maid
themselves.

Person_8
Bye bye!

Side_14
Buh-bye.

Side_14
Tomorrow's another day...

Side_26
I was 30 seconds over!

Side_27
Ugh! Yeah you're a real hero, lady!

Side_28
My mommy says she wishes you were
dead.

Side_14
(less convinced with each
utterance)
I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I
am a real cop. I am a real cop...

Side_29
You! Bunny!

Side_14
Sir, if you have a grievance, you
may contest your citation in
traffic court.

Side_29
What're you talking about? My shop!
It was just robbed! Look, he's
getting away! Well are you a cop or
not?

Side_14
Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I
got this!

Side_14
Stop! Stop in the name of the law!

Side_30
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

Side_30
Whoa. Coming through!

Side_31
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-

Side_14
I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in
pursuit!

Side_14
You! Freeze!

Side_31
(arriving, but too big to
enter)
Hey! Metermaid! Wait for the real
cops!

Side_14
Stop!

Side_14
Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through!
`Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon...

Side_30
Bon voyage, flat foot!

Side_14
Hey! Stop right there!

Side_30
Have a donut, coppah!

Side_32
Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard
print jeggings?
(sees the donut about to
kill her)
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!

Side_14
I love your hair.

Side_32
Aw... thank you.

Side_30
Come to papa...

Side_18
Okay, you're gonna have to be
patient and wait in line just like
everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay?

Side_14
I popped the weasel!

Side_19
Abandoning your post, inciting a
scurry, reckless endangerment of
rodents... but to be fair, you did
stop a master criminal from
stealing two dozen... moldy onions.

Side_14
Hate to disagree with you, sir, but
those aren't onions. Those are a
crocus varietal called Midnicampum
Holicithias. They're a Class C
Botanical, sir. I grew up in a
family where plant husbandry was
kind of a thing.

Side_19
Shut your tiny mouth, now.

Side_14
Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my
job.

Side_19
Your job is putting tickets on
parked cars.

Side_19
Not now.

Side_19
Not now!

Side_14
Sir, I don't want to be a meter
maid... I wanna be a real cop.

Side_19
Do you think the Mayor asked what I
wanted when he assigned you to me?

Side_14
But sir, if you--

Side_19
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song and
your insipid dreams magically come
true. So let it go!

Side_33
Chief Bogo please-- five minutes of
your time. Please...

Side_18
I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop
her, she is super slippery. I gotta
go sit down.

Side_19
Ma'am, as I've told you, we are
doing everything we can...

Side_33
My husband has been missing for ten
days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

Side_19
Yes, I know.

Side_33
He's a florist. We have two
beautiful children. He would never
just disappear.

Side_19
Ma'am, our detectives are very
busy.

Side_33
Please. There's got to be somebody
to find my Em.

Side_19
Mrs. Otterton--

Side_33
Oh, thank you! Bless you, bless you
little bunny!
Take this. Find my Emmitt. Bring
him home to me and my babies.
Please?

Side_19
Mrs. Otterton? Please wait out
here.

Side_33
Of course. Oh, thank you both so
much.

Side_19
One second.

Side_19
You're fired.

Side_14
What? Why?!

Side_19
Insubordination. Now, I'm going to
open this door and you're going to
tell that otter you're a former
meter maid with delusions of
grandeur who will not be taking the
case.

Side_6
I just heard Officer Hopps is
taking the case!

Side_19
Assistant Mayor Bellwether...

Side_6
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is
really starting to pay off! Mayor
Lionheart is just gonna be so
jazzed!

Side_19
No! No, let's not tell the mayor
just yet--

Side_6
And I sent it, and it is done, so I
did do that. All right, well I'd
say the case is in good hands! Us
little guys really need to stick
together! Right?

Side_14
Like glue!

Side_6
Good one! Just call me if you ever
need anything, okay? You've always
got a friend at City Hall, Judy.
Alright, bye bye!

Side_14
Thank you, ma'am.

Side_19
I will give you 48 hours.

Side_19
That's two days to find Emmitt
Otterton.

Side_14
Okay.

Side_19
But, you strike out-- you resign.

Side_14
Oh, uh... okay... deal.

Side_19
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

Side_18
Here ya go! One missing otter!

Side_14
That's it?!

Side_18
Yikes! That is the smallest case
file I've ever seen! Leads: none,
witnesses: none-- and you're not in
the computer system yet, so
resources: none.
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one.

Side_14
Okay.
"Last known sighting..."

Side_14
Can I just borrow--
Thank you.

Side_14
Pawpsicle.

Side_18
The murder weapon!

Side_14
Get your pawpsicle...

Side_18
Yeah, `cause that... What does that
mean?

Side_14
It means I... have a lead.

Side_14
Hi! Hello? It's me again!

Side_21
Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot.

Side_14
Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer
Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.

Side_21
What happened, meter maid? Did
someone steal a traffic cone? It
wasn't me.

Side_21
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the
baby, I gotta get to work.

Side_14
This is important, sir. I think
your ten dollars worth of popsicles
can wait.

Side_21
I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365
days a year, since I was 12, and
time is money, hop along.

Side_14
Please, just look at the picture.

Side_14
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle
right? Do you know him?

Side_21
I know everybody. And I also know
that somewhere there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal, so why
don't you get back to your box.

Side_14
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

Side_21
Did you just boot my stroller?

Side_14
Nicholas Wilde, you are under
arrest.

Side_21
For what? Howting your feewings?

Side_14
Felony tax evasion.

Side_14
Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days
a year... since you were 12, that's
two decades, so times twenty...

Side_14
...which is one million four-
hundred sixty thousand-- I think, I
mean I am just a dumb bunny, but we
are good at multiplying-- anyway,
according to your tax forms...
...you reported let me see here:
zero. Unfortunately, lying on a
federal form is a punishable
offense. Five years jail time.

Side_21
Well, it's my word against yours.

Side_21 (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER)
"200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a
year, since I was 12."

Side_14
Actually, it's your word against
yours. And if you want this pen,
you're going to help me find this
poor missing otter or the only
place you'll be selling popsicles
is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

Side_25
She hustled you.
She hustled you good! You're a cop
now Nick, you're gonna need one of
these! Have fun working with the
fuzz!

Side_14
Start talking.

Side_21
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

Side_14
Great, let's go.

Side_21
It's not exactly a place for a cute
little bunny.

Side_14
Don't call me cute.
Get in the car.

Side_21
Okay. You're the boss.

Side_35
Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm.
Oooooooooooohmmmmmm.

Side_14
Hi, hello.

Side_14
Um, hello? Hello? HELLO?!

Side_14
Hello! My name is--

Side_35
Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there, `cause
we're all good on Bunny Scout
Cookies.

Side_14
Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton. Right here--
--who may have frequented this
establishment.

Side_36
Yeah, Ol' Emmitt! Haven't seen him
in a couple weeks. But hey, you
should talk to his yoga instructor,
I'd be happy to take you back.

Side_14
Oh, thank you so much, I'd
appreciate that more than you can
imagine. It would be such a big--
You are naked!

Side_35
Huh? Oh for sure, we're a
naturalist club.

Side_21
Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be
anything. These guys... they be
naked.

Side_35
Nangi's just on the other side of
the pleasure pool.

Side_21
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because, if so, there's no shame in
calling it quits.

Side_14
Yes there is.

Side_21
Boy, that's the spirit.

Side_35
Yeah, some mammals say the
naturalist life is weird, but you
know what I say is weird? Clothes
on animals! Here we go.

Side_35
As you can see, Nangi's an
elephant, so she'll totally
remember everything. Hey Nangi,
these dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the Otter.

Side_37
Who?

Side_38
Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like 6 years?

Side_37
I have no memory of this beaver.

Side_7
He's an otter actually.

Side_38
He was here a couple Wednesdays
ago. `Member?

Side_37
Nope.

Side_38
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable-
knit sweater vest, and new pair of
corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley
tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real
tight. Remember that Nangi?

Side_37
No.

Side_38
Yeah, and we both walked him out
and he got into this big ol' white
car with a silver trim? Needed a
tune up. The third cylinder wasn't
firing. `Member that, Nangi?

Side_37
Nope.

Side_14
You didn't happen to catch the
license plate number, did you?

Side_38
Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03.

Side_14
0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great
info, thank you.

Side_38
Told ya Nangi has a mind like a
steel trap. I wish I had a memory
like an elephant.

Side_21
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome
for the clue. And seeing as how any
moron can run a plate, I will take
that pen and bid you adieu.

Side_14
The plate... I can't run a plate...
I'm not in the system yet.

Side_21
Give me the pen please.

Side_14
What was it you said? "Any moron
can run a plate?" Gosh... if only
there were a moron around who were
up to the task...

Side_21
Rabbit, I did what you asked, you
can't keep me on the hook forever.

Side_14
Not forever. Why, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case. So
can you run the plate or not?

Side_21
Actually, I just remembered I have
a pal at the DMV...

Side_21
Flash is the fastest guy in there,
you need something done, he's on
it.

Side_14
I hope so, we are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.
Wait. They're all sloths?!

Side_14
You said this was going to be
quick!

Side_21
What? Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I
thought in Zootopia anyone could be
anything.

Side_21
Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see ya.

Side_39
Nice to...
see you...
too.

Side_21
Hey Flash, I'd love ya to meet my
friend-- uh, darlin' I've forgotten
your name.

Side_14
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are ya?

Side_39
I am... doing... just...

Side_14
Fine?

Side_39
...as well... as... I can... be.
What...

Side_21
Hang in there.

Side_39
...can I... do...

Side_14
Well, I was hoping you could run a
plate--

Side_39
For you...

Side_14
Well, I was hoping you could--

Side_39
...today.

Side_14
Well, I was hoping you could run a
plate for us. We are in a really
big hurry.

Side_39
Sure.    What's the... plate...

Side_39
...Number?

Side_39
Side_14
Mmhmm. 0, 3.

Side_21
Hey Flash, wanna hear a joke?

Side_14
No!

Side_39
Sure.

Side_21
What do you call a three humped
camel?

Side_39
I don't... know...
What... do... you call... a...

Side_14
Three humped camel.

Side_39
Three humped... camel?

Side_21
Pregnant.

Side_39
Ha... ha... ha... ha...

Side_14
Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny,
can we please just focus on the
task--

Side_39
Hey... Priscilla...

Side_14
Oh no!

Side_40
Yes... Flash?

Side_39
What... do...

Side_14
No!

Side_39
You call... a...

Side_14
A three humped camel? Pregnant!
Okay, great, we got it, please just-

Side_39
Three... humped...

Side_14
Aggggggghhhhhhh--

Side_39
Here...

Side_14
Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you!

Side_39
You... go.

Side_14
29THD03-- it's registered to...
Tundratown Limo Service? A limo
took Otterton, and the limo's in
Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown!

Side_21
Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I
owe ya.

Side_14
Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour
and--

Side_14
Closed. Great.

Side_21
Mm. And I will betcha you don't
have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn
it. It's a bummer.

Side_14
You wasted the day on purpose.

Side_21
Madam, I have a fake badge. I would
never impede your pretend
investigation.

Side_14
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see--
(showing picture of
Otterton)
See him? This otter is missing.

Side_21
Well then they should have gotten a
real cop to find him.

Side_14
What is your problem? Does seeing
me fail somehow make you feel
better about your own sad,
miserable life?

Side_21
It does. One hundred percent.
Now... since you're sans warrant, I
guess we're done?

Side_14
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

Side_21
Hey!

Side_21
First off, you throw like a bunny,
second, you're a very sore loser.
See ya later, Officer Fluff, so sad
this is over, I wish I could've
helped more.

Side_14
The thing is, you don't need a
warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty
low-life climbing the fence, so
you're helping plenty. Come on.

Side_14
29THD03... this is it.

Side_14
Polar bear fur.

Side_21
Side_14
What? What?!

Side_21
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!
But on CD? Who still uses CDs?

Side_21
Carrots...? If your otter was
here... he had a very bad day.

Side_14
Those are... claw marks. You ever
seen anything like this?

Side_21
No.

Side_14
Oh, wait. Look.

Side_14
This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He
was definitely here. What do you
think happened?

Side_21
Well, now wait a minute...
Polar bear fur... Rat Pack music...
fancy cup...
I know whose car this is. We gotta
go!

Side_14
Why? Whose car is it?

Side_21
The most feared crime boss in
Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big
and he does not like me, so we
gotta go!

Side_14
I'm not leaving, this is a crime
scene.

Side_21
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me
here, so we're leaving right now!

Side_21
Raymond! And, is that Kevin?! Long
time no see. And speaking of no
see, how about you forget you saw
me? Huh? For old time's sake?

Side_21
That's a no.

Side_14
What did you do that made Mr. Big
so mad at you?

Side_21
I uh, I may have sold him a very
expensive wool rug... that was made
from the fur of a... skunk's butt.

Side_14
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

Side_14
Is that Mr. Big?

Side_21
No.

Side_14
What about him? Is that him?

Side_21
No.

Side_14
That's gotta be him.

Side_21
Stop talking stop talking stop
talking--

Side_21
Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple
misunder-

Side_21
This is a simple misunderstanding.

Side_41
You come here unannounced... on the
day my daughter is to be married?

Side_21
Well actually we were brought here
against our will, so...
Point is, I did not know it was
your car, and I certainly did not
know about your daughter's wedding.

Side_41
I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed
you into my home... we broke bread
together... Gram-mama made you her
cannoli. And how did you repay my
generosity? With a rug... made from
the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt
rug. You disrespected me. You
disrespected my gram-mama who I
buried in that skunk butt rug. I
told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are,
snooping around with this...
What are you, a performer? What's
with the costume?

Side_14
Sir, I am a c--

Side_21
Mime! She is a mime. This mime,
cannot speak. You can't speak if
you're a mime.

Side_14
No. I am a cop. And I'm on the
Emmitt Otterton case, and my
evidence puts him in your car, so
intimidate me all you want, I'm
going to find out what you did to
that otter if it's the last thing I
do.

Side_41
Then I have only one request: say
hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em!

Side_21
Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm
not saying nothing--

Side_41
And you never will--

Side_21
Please! No no no! If you're mad at
me about the rug I've got more
rugs!

Side_32
Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance.
(sees them trying to kill
Nick)
What did we say? No icing anyone at
my wedding!

Side_41
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.
Ice `em.

Side_32
Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that
saved my life yesterday. From that
giant donut.

Side_41
This bunny?

Side_32
Yeah. Hi!

Side_14
Hi.
I love your dress.

Side_32
Aw, thank you.

Side_41
Put `em down.
You have done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter. I
will take your kindness... and pay
it forward.

Side_41
Otterton is my florist. He's like a
part of the family. He had
something important he wanted to
discuss. That's why I sent that car
to pick him up. But he never
arrived.

Side_14
Because he was attacked.

Side_41
No... he attacked.

Side_14
Otterton?

Side_41
Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up
the car, scared my driver half to
death and disappeared into the
night.

Side_14
He's a sweet little otter.

Side_41
My child, we may be evolved... but
deep down we are still animals.

Side_14
Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We
just want to know what happened to
Emmitt Otterton.

Side_21
Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?

Side_14
What... happened?

Side_42
There was no warning, he just kept
yelling about the "night howlers."
Over and over, "the night
howlers..."

Side_21
Oh. So you know about the night
howlers too? Good, good, good.
Because the night howlers are
exactly what we are here to talk
about.
Right?

Side_14
Yep. So, uh, you just open the door
and tell us what you know and we
will tell you what we know. Okay?

Side_42
Okay.

Side_14
Clever fox.

Side_14
Mr. Manchas?

Side_21
Buddy?

Side_14
Are you... okay?

Side_14
Run. RUN!

Side_21
What is wrong with him?!

Side_14
I don't know!!

Side_14
Jump!

Side_14
Head down!

Side_14
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

Side_18
Are you familiar with Gazelle?
Greatest singer of our lifetime--
angel with horns-- okay, hold on,
keep watching. Who's that beside
her? Who is it?

Side_18
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real! It's not. It's
just a new app.
(finally notices ringing
phone)
Hold on a second--

Side_18!
Side_14
Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a
10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and
Tu-junja!

Side_21
It's Tujunga!

Side_14
There! Head to the skytrams!

Side_21
Get in! Carrots? Carrots!

Side_14
Go!

Side_21
No, no, no!

Side_21
Buddy, one predator to another--                      *

Side_21
Now, I can tell you're a little
tense, so I'm just gonna give you a
little personal space--

Side_21
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let
go!

Side_14
I'm gonna let go!

Side_21
No, you what? No, I said-- listen--
noooo!

Side_14
One, two--

Side_21
Carrots. You saved my life.

Side_14
Side_44
Well. That's what we do at the
Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....

Side_19
Well, this should be good.

Side_14
I thought this was just a missing
mammal case, but it's way bigger.

Side_14
Mr. Otterton did not just
disappear. I believe he and this
jaguar, they... went savage, Sir.

Side_19
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't go savage.

Side_14
I thought so too, `til I saw this:

Side_14
What? He was right here...

Side_19
The "savage" jaguar.

Side_14
Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost
killed us.

Side_19
Or maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.
Let's go.

Side_14
Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one
who saw him!
Nick!

Side_19
You think I'm going to believe a
fox?

Side_14
Well he was a key witness and I
enlisted--

Side_19
Two days to find the otter...

Side_19
or you quit... that was the deal.
Badge.

Side_14
But, Sir, we...

Side_19
Badge.

Side_19
What did you say, fox?

Side_21
Sorry, what I said was, "no." She
will not be giving you that badge.
Look, you gave her a clown vest and
a three-wheel joke-mobile and two
days to solve a case you guys
haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah,
no wonder she needed to get help
from a fox, none of you guys were
gonna help her, were you?

Side_21
Here's the thing Chief, you gave
her the 48 hours, so technically we
still have 10 left to find our Mr.
Otterton... and that's exactly what
we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse
us... we have a very big lead to
follow and a case to crack. Good
day.

Side_21
Officer Hopps?

Side_14
Thank you.

Side_21
Never let `em see that they get to
you.

Side_14
So, things do get to you...

Side_21
No... I mean, not anymore. But I
was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

Side_14
Har-har.

Side_21
(retreating into the
memory)
No, it's true. I think was 8, or
maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was
join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

Side_45
Ready for initiation?

Side_46
Yeah! Pretty much born ready.

Side_45
Okay. Now raise your right hand and
deliver the oath.

Side_46
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be
brave, loyal, helpful, and
trustworthy.

Side_45
Even though you're a fox?

Side_46
What?

Side_46
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?!
No! Please tell me, what did I do
wrong?!

Side_46
What did I do?!

Side_45
If you thought we would ever trust
a fox without a muzzle, you're even
dumber than you look.

Side_45 (O.S.)
Aw, is he gonna cry?

Side_21
I learned two things that day. One,
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

Side_14
...And two?

Side_21
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy,
there's no point in trying to be
anything else.

Side_14
Nick, you are so much more than
that...

Side_21
Boy, look at that traffic down
there.
How about we go out to Chuck in
Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are
things looking on the Jam Cams?

Side_14
Nick, I'm glad you told me...

Side_21
The Jam Cams...!

Side_14
Seriously, it's okay...

Side_21
No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic
cameras everywhere. All over the
canopy. Whatever happened to that
jaguar--

Side_14
The traffic cams would have caught
it!

Side_21
Bingo!

Side_14
Pretty sneaky, Slick.

Side_21
However. If you didn't have access
to the system before, I doubt Chief
Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into
it now.

Side_14
No... But I have a friend at City
Hall who might.

Side_6
Sir? If we could just review these
very important--
Sir?

Side_6
Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?!

Side_5
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just
take care of it!
(setting another binder
atop her stack)
Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm
going out.

Side_6
No, no! But, sir, you do have a
meeting with Herds and Grazing...
sir, if I could just--

Side_6
Oh, mutton chops.

Side_14
Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need
your help.

Side_14
We just need to get into the
traffic cam database.

Side_21
So fluffy!

Side_14
Hey!

Side_21
Sheep never let me this close.

Side_14
You can't just touch a sheep's
wool...

Side_21                          HOPPS
It's like cotton candy.            Stop it!

Side_6
Where to?

Side_14
Rainforest District, Vine and
Tujunga.

Side_6
There! Traffic cams for the whole
city. This is so exciting,
actually. Well, you know, I never
get to do anything this important.

Side_14
But you're the Assistant Mayor of
Zootopia.

Side_6
Oh, I'm more of a glorified
secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote...
But he did give me that nice mug.

Side_6
Feels good to be appreciated.

Side_6
That's a fun little name he likes
to use. I called him Lionfart once.
He did not care for that, let me
tell you. It was not a good day for
me.
Yes, sir?

Side_6
Oh, dear. I better go --
Let me know what you find. It was
really nice for me to be--

Side_21
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

Side_14
Shush. Okay, traffic cams...
Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.

Side_14
Who are these guys?

Side_21
Timberwolves. Look at these
dumdums.

Side_21
Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna
howl.

Side_21
And there it is. What is it with
wolves and the howling? It's like--

Side_14
Howlers! Night howlers! That's what
Manchas was afraid of... wolves!
The wolves are the night howlers.
If they took Manchas...

Side_21
...I bet they took Otterton too.

Side_14
All we gotta do is find out where
they went.

Side_14
Wait. Where'd they go?

Side_21
You know, if I wanted to avoid
surveillance because I was doing
something illegal-- which I never
have-- I would use the maintenance
tunnel 6B... which would put them
out...

Side_21
...right there.

Side_14
Well, look at you, Junior
Detective. You know, I think you'd
actually make a pretty good cop.

Side_21
How dare you.

Side_21
Acacia alley... Ficus underpass...
South Canyon...

Side_14
They're heading out of town...
Where does that road go?

Side_49
Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a
howl.

Side_50
I didn't start it.
Oooooooo!

Side_49
Oooooooooo!

Side_14
Come on!

Side_21
You are a clever bunny.

Side_14
It looks like this was a hospital.

Side_21
You know, after you, you're the
cop.

Side_21
Okay. All clear.

Side_14
All this equipment is brand new...

Side_14
Claw marks...

Side_21
Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I
mean, what kind of--

Side_14
Mr. Manchas.

Side_14
It's him. We found our otter.
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer
Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to
find you. We're gonna get you out
of here now.

Side_21
Or not. Guess he's in no rush to
get home to the Missus.

Side_14
...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including
Manchas it's 14...
Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing
Mammal files... They're all here.
All the missing mammals are right
here.

Side_51
Mayor Lionheart, please, we're
doing everything we can.

Side_5
Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a
half animals here who've gone off
the rails crazy-- and you can't
tell me why. Now, I'd call that
awfully far from doing everything.

Side_51
Sir, it may be time to consider
their biology.

Side_5
What? What do you mean biology?

Side_51
The only animals going savage are
predators. We cannot keep it a
secret. We need to come forward.

Side_5
Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public.
And how do you think they're gonna
feel about their mayor, who is a
lion?! I'll be ruined!

Side_51
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

Side_5
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are
going to keep it that way.

Side_5
Someone's here!

Side_51
Sir, you need to go, now!
Security! Sweep the area!

Side_21
Great! We're dead. We're dead.
That's it. I'm dead. You're dead.
Everybody's dead.

Side_14
Can you swim?

Side_21
What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim.
Why?

Side_21
Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?!

Side_14
We gotta tell Bogo!

Side_18
Chief Bogo!

Side_19
Not now!

Side_18
Wait, is that Gazelle?

Side_19
(struggling to silence his
phone)
No!

Side_18
You have the app too?!
Oh, jeeeeez!

Side_19
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm
working on the missing mammal
cases?!

Side_18
Oh, yes of course! About that,
sir... Officer Hopps just called...
She found all of `em.

Side_14
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything--

Side_5
You don't understand. I was trying
to protect the city.

Side_14
You were just trying to protect
your job.

Side_5
No. Listen, we still don't know why
this is happening. It could destroy
Zootopia.

Side_14
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court
of law...

Side_19
Ladies and Gentlemammals... 14
mammals went missing and all 14
have been found by our newest
recruit, who will speak to you in a
moment. But first, let me remind
you--

Side_14
Rrrgh. I am so nervous...

Side_21
Okay, press conference 101: You
wanna look smart?

Side_21
Answer their question with your own
question and then answer that
question. Like this, "Excuse me.
Officer Hopps, what can you tell us
about the case?"
"Well, was this a tough case? Yes.
Yes it was." You see?

Side_14
You should be there with me. We did
this together.

Side_21
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

Side_14
Funny you should say that, because
I've been thinking... it would be
nice to have a partner.

Side_14
Here. In case you need something to
write with.

Side_6
Officer Hopps, it's time.

Side_19
So now, I'll turn things over to
the officer who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.

Side_52
Officer Hopps! / Over here! / Here!

Side_14
Yes?

Side_53
What can you tell us about the
animals that went savage?

Side_14
Well, the animals in question...
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes they are.

Side_53 2
Okay, so what is the connection?

Side_14
Well, all we know is that they are
all members of the predator family.

Side_55
So, predators are the only ones
going savage?

Side_14
That is accu-- Yes, that is
accurate. Yes...

Side_53 3
Wow. Why is that happening?

Side_14
We still don't know--

Side_14
Ah, it may have something to do
with biology.

Side_14
A biological component. You know,
something in their DNA...

Side_53 4
In their DNA? Can you elaborate on
that, please?

Side_14
Yes. What I mean is, thousands of
years ago... um... predators
survived through their aggressive
hunting instincts. For whatever
reason, they seem to be reverting
back to their primitive, savage
ways.

Side_14
It is possible. So we must be
vigilant. And we at the ZPD are
prepared and are here to protect
you...

Side_52
Will more mammals go savage? / What
is being done to protect us? / Have
you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

Side_6
Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh,
that's all the time that we have.
No more questions...

Side_14
Was I okay?

Side_6
Oh, you did fine.

Side_14
That went so fast! I didn't get a
chance to mention you or say
anything about how we--

Side_21
Oh, I think you said plenty.

Side_14
What do you mean?

Side_21
Clearly, there's a biological
component? These predators may be
reverting back to their primitive,
savage ways. Are you serious?

Side_14
I just stated the facts of the
case. I mean, it's not like a bunny
could go savage...

Side_21
Right. But a fox could? Huh?

Side_14
Nick, stop it. You're not like
them.

Side_21
Oh, there's a them now?

Side_14
You know what I mean. You're not
that kind of predator.

Side_21
The kind that needs to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think you
need to carry around Fox Repellent?

Side_21
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we
met.
So let me ask you a question. Are
you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts? Do
you think I might go savage? Do you
think I might try to... EAT YOU?!

Side_21
...I knew it. Just when I thought
somebody actually believed in me...

Side_21
Probably best if you don't have a
predator as a partner.

Side_14
No. Nick. Nick!

Side_53 5
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

Side_14
No. He's my friend.

Side_53 6
We can't even trust our own
friends?

Side_14
That is not what I said! Please!

Side_53S
Are we safe? / Have any other foxes
gone savage?

Side_61
More bad news in this city gripped
by fear.

Side_61
A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling by a savage
polar bear. This-- the 27th such
attack-- comes just one week after
ZPD Officer Judy Hopps connected
the violence to traditionally
predatory animals.

Side_62
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized
by pop star, Gazelle, was marred by
protest.

Side_63
Go back to the forest, predator!

Side_17
I'm from the savannah!

Side_12
Zootopia is a unique place. It's a
crazy, beautiful, diverse city
where we celebrate our differences.
(gestures to PROTESTERS in
background)
This is not the Zootopia I know.

Side_33
That's not my Emmitt.

Side_12
We cannot let fear divide us.
Please-- give me back the Zootopia
I love...

Side_19
Come on Hopps. The new Mayor wants
to see us.

Side_14
The Mayor? Why?

Side_19
It would seem you've arrived.

Side_14
Clawhauser? What're you doing?

Side_18
Um, they thought it would be better
if a predator such as myself wasn't
the first face you that you see
when you walk into the ZPD.

Side_14
What?

Side_18
They're gonna move me to Records.
It's downstairs. By the boiler.

Side_19
Hopps!

Side_14
Um... I don't understand.

Side_6
Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And
right now they're just really
scared. You're a hero to them. They
trust you. And so that's why Chief
Bogo and I want you to be the
public face of the ZPD.

Side_14
I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came
here to make the world a better
place, but I think I broke it.

Side_19
Don't give yourself so much credit,
Hopps. The world has always been
broken. That's why we need good
cops-- like you.

Side_14
With all due respect, sir, a good
cop is supposed to serve and
protect-- help the city. Not tear
it apart.
I don't deserve this badge.

Side_19
Hopps.

Side_6
Judy, you've worked so hard to get
here. It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid. You can't quit...

Side_14
Thank you for the opportunity.

Side_14
A dozen carrots.

Side_64
Thanks!

Side_14
Have a nice day.

Side_64
Come on.

Person_7
Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude,
remember that one? How we doin?

Side_14.
I'm fine.

Person_8
You are not fine. Your ears are
droopy.

Side_14
Why did I think I could make a
difference?

Person_7
Because you're a trier, that's why.

Person_8
You've always been a trier.

Side_14
Oh, I tried. And it made life so
much worse for so many innocent
predators.

Person_7
Oh, not all of them, though. Speak
of the devil. Right on time.

Side_14
Is that... Gideon Grey?

Person_7
Yep. It sure is. We work with him
now.

Person_8
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it had you
not opened our minds.

Person_7
That's right. I mean, Gid's turned
into one of the top pastry chefs in
the tri-burrows.

Side_14
That's really cool, you guys.

Side_14
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

Side_66
Hey Judy-- I'd like to say I'm
sorry for the way I behaved in my
youth. I had a lotta self-doubt
that manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression. I
was a major jerk.

Side_14
Well, I know a thing or two about
being a jerk...

Side_66
Anyhow-- I brought you all these
pies.

Person_7
Hey kids! Don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias!

Side_67
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Side_66
Now there's a 4-dollar word, Mr. H.
My family always just called them
night howlers.

Side_14
I'm sorry, what did you say?

Person_7
Oh, Gid's talking about those
flowers, Judy. I use `em to keep
bugs off the produce. But I don't
like the little ones going near `em
on account of what happened to your
Uncle Terry.

Person_8
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we
were kids and went completely nuts.

Person_7
He bit the dickens out of your
mother.

Side_14
A bunny can go savage...

Person_8
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

Person_7
Well sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that
savage.

Side_14
Night howlers aren't wolves.
They're flowers. The flowers are
making the predators go savage.
That's it! That's what I've been
missing!

Side_14
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry!
Come on! Thank you, I love you bye!

Person_7
You catch any of that, Bon?

Person_8
Not one bit.

Person_6
Well, that makes me feel a little
better. I thought she was talking
in tongues or something.

Side_25
Who is it?

Side_14
I need to find Nick. Please.

Side_14
Nick? Nick!

Side_14
Oh, Nick! Night howlers aren't
wolves. They're toxic flowers. I
think someone is targeting
predators on purpose and making
them go savage.

Side_21
Wow. Isn't that interesting.

Side_14
Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll
never forgive me. And I don't blame
you. I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant and irresponsible
and small-minded... But predators
shouldn't suffer because of my
mistakes. I have to fix this, but I
can't do it without you.

Side_14
And after we're done, you can hate
me, and that'll be fine, because I
was a horrible friend and I hurt
you... and you can walk away
knowing you were right all along, I
really am just a dumb bunny.

Side_14 (ON RECORDER)
I really am just a dumb bunny. I
really am just a dumb bunny.

Side_21
Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you
erase it... in 48 hours.

Side_21
Alright, get in here.

Side_21
Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so
emotional. There we go. Deep
breath.
Are you just trying to steal the
pen. Is that what this is?
You are standing on my tail,
though. Off, off, off.

Side_14
I'm sorry.

Side_21
I thought you guys only grew
carrots.
What's the plan?

Side_14
We are gonna follow the night
howlers.

Side_21
Okay. How?

Side_14
Know this guy?

Side_21
Uh-huh. I told you, I know
everybody.

Side_30
Well, hello, step right up!
Anything you need... I got it. All
your favorite movies! I got movies
that haven't even been released
yet!

Side_30
Hey, 15% off! 20! Make me an offer!
Come on!

Side_21
Well, well, look who it is. The
duke of bootleg.

Side_30
What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't
you be melting down a popsicle or
something?
Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.

Side_14
We both know those weren't moldy
onions I caught you stealing. What
were you gonna do with those night
howlers, Wessleton?

Side_30
It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And
I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't
nothing you can do to make me.

Side_41
Ice `em.

Side_30
Aaagh! Agh!
Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?!
She's a cop!

Side_41
And the godmother to my future
granddaughter.

Side_32
I'm gonna name her Judy.

Side_14
Aw.

Side_41
Ice this weasel.

Side_30
All right, all right, please! I'll
talk! I'll talk. I stole them night
howlers so I could sell `em. They
offered me what I couldn't
refuse... Money.

Side_14
And to whom did you sell them?

Side_14
Come on!

Side_14
The weasel wasn't lying.

Side_21
Yeah, looks like old Doug's
cornered the market on night
howlers...

Side_69
You got Doug here. What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

Side_69
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.
I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny
little otter through the open
window of a moving car.

Side_69
Yeah I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news. Ya
know, whichever comes first.

Side_69
Alright, Woolter and Jesse are
back, so I'm leaving now.
Out.

Side_21
Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get
back here! What are you doing?!
He's gonna see you! What are you
looking at? Hey! Whatever you're
thinking, stop thinking it.
Carrots! Carrots!

Side_69
It better have the extra foam this
time--

Side_21
What are you doing?! You just
trapped us in here!

Side_14
We need to get this evidence to the

Side_21
Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.

Side_14
No. All of it!

Side_21
Wait, what?

Side_21
Great, you're a conductor now? Hey,
listen-- It would take a miracle to
get this rust-bucket going.

Side_21
Well... Hallelujah!

Side_69
We kinda got a situation at the
lab...
Oh! It just got worse!

Side_21
Mission accomplished. Would it be
premature for me to do a little
victory toot-toot?

Side_14
All right. One toot-toot.

Side_21
Well, I can cross that off the
bucket list.

Side_21
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

Side_21
Maybe that's just hail?

Side_21
Back off!

Side_21
Incoming!

Side_21
Carrots?!

Side_14
Don't stop! Keep going!

Side_70
No! No! Please stop!

Side_14
Do not stop this car!

Side_14
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

Side_21
There's another train coming!

Side_14
Trust me! SPEED! UP!

Side_71
Stop the train! Hey!

Side_14
Hey. Need some help?

Side_21
Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast!
Hold on!

Side_21
I think this is our stop!

Side_14
Okay... Maybe some of the evidence
survived.

Side_14
Everything is gone. We've lost it
all.

Side_21
Yeah. Oh, except for this.

Side_14
Oh, Nick! Yes!

Side_21
Ow.

Side_14
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through the Natural History
Museum!

Side_14
Oh! There it is!

Side_14
Mayor Bellwether!
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a
serum-- that's what's making them
go savage.

Side_6
I am so proud of you, Judy. You did
just a super job.

Side_14
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know where to find us?

Side_6
I'll go ahead and I'll take that
case now.

Side_14
You know what... I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD...

Side_14                           NICK
Run!                            Run!

Side_6
Get them!

Side_14
Ach!

Side_21
Ah Carrots!

Side_21
I got ya, come here, come here.

Side_21
Okay, now just relax.

Side_21
Whoops... Blueberry?

Side_14
Pass.

Side_14
Take the case. Get it to Bogo.

Side_21
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

Side_14
I can't walk.

Side_21
Just, we'll think of something.

Side_6
We're on the same team, Judy!

Side_6
Underestimated. Under-appreciated.
Aren't you sick of it? Predators.
They may be strong and loud, but
prey out-number predators 10 to
one.

Side_6
Think of it-- 90 percent of the
population, united against a common
enemy. We'll be unstoppable.

Side_6
Over there!

Side_6
Well, you should have stayed on the
carrot farm, huh? It really is too
bad; I really did like you.

Side_14
What are you going to do? Kill me?

Side_6
No! Of course not... he is.

Side_14
No! Nick?!

Side_6
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the natural history museum.
Officer Hopps is down! Please
hurry!

Side_14
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

Side_6
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

Side_6
Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero
Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."

Side_14
So that's it, prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

Side_6
Yeah, pretty much.

Side_14
It won't work.

Side_6
Fear always works. And I'll dart
every predator in Zootopia to keep
it that way.

Side_14
Oh, Nick! No!

Side_6
Bye-Bye, Bunny.

Side_14
Blood, blood, blood! And death.

Side_21
All right, you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it, I think
we got it. We got it up there,
thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it
all out beautifully.

Side_6
What?

Side_21
Yea, oh, are you looking for the
serum?
Well, it's right here.

Side_14
What you've got in the weapon there-
- those are blueberries. From my
family's farm.

Side_21
They are delicious.
You should try some.

Side_6
I framed Lionheart, I can frame you
too! It's my word against yours!

Side_14
Oooo, actually--

Side_14
--It's your word against yours.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
Boom.

Side_73
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,
claiming he was just trying to
protect the city.

Side_5
Did I falsely imprison those
animals? Well, yes. Yes I did. It
was a classic "doing the wrong
thing for the right reason" kind of
a deal.

Side_74
In related news, doctors say the
night howler antidote is proving
effective in rehabilitating the
afflicted predators...

Side_33
Emmitt? Oh... Emmitt...

Side_33
Thank you.

Side_14
So, no matter what type of animal
you are, from the biggest elephant
to our first fox...

Side_14
I implore you... try. Try to make
the world a better place.

Side_14
Look inside yourself, and recognize
that change starts with you. It
starts with me. It starts with all
of us.

Side_19
...Enough! Shut it! We have some
new recruits with us this morning,
including our first fox. Who cares.

Side_21
Ha! You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards,
sir.

Side_19
Shut your mouth, Wilde.
Assignments! Officers Grizzoli,
Fangmeyer, Delgato: Tundratown
Swat. Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard:
Undercover. Hopps, Wilde...
Parking duty. Dismissed.
Just kidding! We have reports of a
street racer tearing up Savannah
Central. Find him, shut him down.

Side_21
So are all rabbits bad drivers or
is it just you?

Side_14
Oops. Sorry.

Side_21
Sly bunny.

Side_14
Dumb fox.

Side_21
You know you love me.

Side_14
Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do.

Side_14
Sir, you were going 115 miles per
hour. I hope you have a good
explanation.

Side_21
Flash? Flash? Hundred yard dash?!

Side_39
Nick.

Person_1
Cooool.

Person_2
Evening, Constable!

Person_3
Hi, Arthur.

Person_2
Are you familiar with the
expression `I can explain
everything'?

Person_3
Out of the car, please.

Person_2
Terribly sorry, but in the film
they used a different model to show
the old Batchap getting in and out.
This one has no doors, so I'd have
to squeeze out the back arsehole
first. Which nobody wants...
Apart from you, cheeky monkey!
It's a joke! Okay, okay.

Person_3
Okay, explain everything.

Person_2
Well. What with having spunked 1.6
million fat Alberts on this little
runaround, I thought why not take
it a step further and try to
actually collar a few ne-er do
wells? It worked for the
billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
Templemead? Will I have to do
traffic school?

Person_4
How much have you drunk, Arthur?

Person_2
To use the technical medical term -
megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
have a designated driver.

Person_5
Where's my five thousand dollars?

Person_2
The Boy Homeless here neglected to
say he'd never driven.

Person_2
Or that the only reason he's sober
is to be ready for the conspiracy
of leopards about to seize
Manhattan.

Person_5
It's LIZARDS! English prick!

Person_2
I trust this will cover all repairs
to New York and any inconvenience
to your good selves?

Person_2
Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
other chap.

Person_6
Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!

Person_2
Goodness. Why?

Person_6
Said I cut the bombita with pig
killer!

Person_2
Rude man. And who threw hot
Americano in whose face again?

Person_6
I did in his. No half and half
neither. That shit burnt!

Person_7
I burnt my sister's hair.

Person_6
Cool...

Person_7
Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause
I don't fit her definition of
hygiene. Plenty of places to take a
shit, toilet's just one of them.
Just ask the a-rabs.

It's like a chat show, this.

of becoming a crack whore?

Person_9
Mother died when I was six.

Person_2
Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.

Person_9
My father raped me when I was
twelve.

Person_2
Sounds like you had six relatively
good years.

Person_6
What do you do?

Person_2
I model riding boots, I spend
money, I sleep with women. But I
have weekends off and I am my own
boss.

Person_3
Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G-
d-lawyer's here.

Side_1
I don't think your mother will be
pleased, Arthur.

Person_2
Really, Elverton - if a chap can't
help out a few chums, whatever
their station in life.

Person_2
Each has given his or her word to
put the criminal life behind them.

Person_2
I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep
easy tonight.

Person_6
Don't point that shit at me, bitch!
I will FUCK YOU UP!

Person_5
Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!

Side_2
Arthur! What will your mother say?
Didn't she send you here to get you
out of the British papers? Arthur!

Person_2
Anyone need a job? My last driver
resigned after I filled his limo
with squirrels. Preferably sober,
clean driving licence?

Person_2
Stand back!

Person_2
The what?

Person_2
Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix
this thing right now.
How much, sir?

Side_3
Um. $800 please.

Person_2
Coming right up.
Fries with that?

Person_2
Congratulations everyone! THE

Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can
you squeeze me in for a little
snack? Yeah, just me and a couple
of mates.

gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a
motherlode of chips and your entire
wine cellar please.

Arthur?

Who are the women with you, Arthur?

Person_2
Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe
she works for Avis. Checks the cars
for dings, dead people in the
trunk, that sort of thing. And
this is Carmella. Anyway...

Side_4'S FATHER
What do you do, Carmella?

Side_6
Whatever you want. But no
penetration without a rubber.

Person_2
Carmella's joking. She's actually
a...queen. Of a very small country.

Side_4'S FATHER
Is she now?

Person_2
It's terribly small.

Side_4'S FATHER
I see.

Person_2
Rhode Island could beat the crap
out of it in a war.

Side_4'S FATHER
Yes, it's a small place.

Person_2
85 cents in a cab from one end of
the country to the other. I'm
talking small.

Side_4'S FATHER
I think I understand how small it
is.

Person_2
Just had the entire country
carpeted, this is not a big place.

Side_4'S FATHER
You need to grow up, Arthur.

Person_2
That's easy for you to say, you
haven't got 50 pairs of short
trousers hanging in your closet.
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

Side_4
Maybe you should.

Person_2
Could I have all those lobsters to
go, please?

Person_2
Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot
Rosy Lee right up your fanny?

Person_2
Hugh Grant Mr Bean self deprecation
mad cow disease Yorkshire pudding
bad teeth rain rain rain rain!

Person_2
Morning, Hobson!

Side_7
Morning, Arthur.

Side_7
I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus
package failed to reignite the
economy.
De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?

Person_2
Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.

Side_7
The African heritage festival
celebrated five months from now?

Person_2
(noticing Sofia's stopped
having sex with him)
Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry.
How impolite of me. Sofia, this is
Hobson, my nanny.

Side_8
Nanny?

Side_7
He's merely shaped like an adult.

Side_8
Is she going to stay here?

Person_2
Hobson, could you come back in a
minute and a half please?

Side_7
Negative. You're seeing your mother
this morning.

Person_2
Nobody told me.

Side_7
Actually I did, on the other side
of the vast moat of champagne known
as `last night'.

Side_7
I wouldn't recommend letting him
get used to your breasts, dear.
Addictive personality. He was at
mine until he was six.

Person_2
Hobson! Really...

Side_7
I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the
nipples to see him off...

Side_8
I can't do this.

Side_7
I support your decision 100%. Will
you be requiring a taxi, or just be
getting in a random passing car?

Side_7
Say goodbye to your new friends,
Arthur. They have to go back to the
recession now.

Person_2
Cancel my mother please, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today.

Person_2
Not the death metal, please!

Side_7
Aren't you a fan of Carcass?

Side_7
`Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a
classic of its genre.

Side_7
Good boy.

Person_2
I'm going for a shower.

Side_7
I'll alert the media.

Side_7
They brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her
name...Hobson!

Person_2
Female Tom Hanks!

Side_7
She's early today...

Person_2
Can we invite her up and dress her
as Forrest Gump?

Side_7
No.

Person_2
Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.

Side_7
Do your armpits.

Side_7
Mr. Miller? My employer
inexplicably agreed to purchase
your...
`Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care
Bear'? For $11,000 plus shipping
costs? Sorry, but that transaction
will take place over my dead body,
and I'm feeling rather well today.

Person_2
Father Wolverine...

Person_2
Wank Williams...That man has the
constitution of an ox.

Side_7
That reminds me, clean your
genitals. Heaven knows what
wildlife that girl was harbouring
between her thighs.

Person_2
I give you `Sideways farting
spider'.

Side_7
Arthur, you have to stop giving
money away!

Person_2
I'm a philanthropist.

Side_7
With the emphasis on the `pissed'.
Really, what is it about unearned
wealth that brings out such idiocy
in those who have it and those who
want it? The way you're going,
you'll have spent your inheritance
before you've inherited it.

Person_2
`Eagle pointing at lesbian.'

Side_7
Why did you fire Jessica?

Person_2
What kind of yoga teacher won't let
a pupil invent positions? She was
a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D.
`Upwards Pooping Astronaut'.

Side_7
Interesting. It looks more like
`Rich twit hiding from mother.' May
I remind you, she finances your
preposterous existence...

Person_2
I know, I know. Never bite the hand
that fists me.

Side_9
Sorry, fellas.

Person_2
Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He
got laid off in Chicago...

Side_7
But he doesn't know his way around
New York!

Person_2
So? I want interesting, fun people
around me, not drones who just get
the job done...

Person_2
Marty! Stop the car!

Side_10
...and inspired by the machine age
of the 1920s, this magnificent
structure was the world's tallest
building for 11 months before the
Empire State stole its thunder.

Side_10
The Chrysler got its name when the
builder went bust in the 1928
Cement Famine and had to melt down
his Chrysler to make the pointy bit
at the top. If you peer closely you
can still make out remnants of a
hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk
twice if you voted Hoover.'

Side_10
That was a joke, folks. It was
built for the Chrysler corporation.

Side_10
The spire is a beauty, especially
on a winter's morning when the sun
hits it and it just seems to...

Side_10
1047 feet madam, not allowing for
pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.

Person_2
Can I join your tour please?

Side_10
Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the
free authentic street pretzel.
Sorry, my bosses make the prices.

Side_10
Sorry. I can't take cards.
Ah, owe me it. I start on that
corner every day on the hour...

Side_10
Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't
your braille windshield work?

Person_2
Wow. What did you say?

Side_10
Just generalised criticism of his
parents and genitals.
Everyone make it over alive?
Excellent. Next we enter Times
Square, world famous for New Year's
Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball
descends at eye-poppingly slow
speed for the inexplicable
entertainment of a million drunk
fools. Many people think the square
is actually a square, despite
blatant evidence otherwise.
Sir? What shape is Times Square?

Person_2
A circle?

Side_11
When do we get the pretzel?

Side_10
Soon, sir. Soon.

Side_10
Okay, next the very Laundromat once
used by George Gershwin, Donald
Trump...

Side_10
...Mr Big from Sex and the City and
three of the 9-11 terrorists.

Side_10
Oh, dad.

Side_10
The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank
himself to death at the Chelsea
Hotel half an hour after losing a
sock in this very dryer.

Side_10
Are you abusing the tour to stalk
me?

Person_2
Absolutely.

Person_2
These things are amazing. Have you
ever put all your father's clothes
on and just got inside one?

Side_7
Where the blazes is that boy?
Arthur!

Side_10
Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's
crown, the Empire State Building.
This iconic symbol of American
corporate might was adapted during
World War 2 in case of attack from
enemy forces. At three minutes'
notice the entire structure can
retract into the ground like a
tortoise's head.

Side_12
That's not possible. I should know,
I'm a civil engineer.

Side_10
You're not being very civil to me.

Person_2
The building doesn't retract; the
ground rises up.

Side_10
Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank
you, sir.

Person_2
They were going to install giant
legs so if a plane was flying at
the tower it could run away. But
where's it going to run?

Side_10
Manhattan's in the way.

Person_2
It'd have to jump in the Hudson.

Side_10
Victory to the Nazis. Is that what
you want?

Side_10
Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits.

Side_10
Do I know you from somewhere?

Person_2
If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.

Side_10
What are they?

Person_2
The gossip websites.

Side_10
That the internet? Ah, my
computer's too old for all that.

Person_2
For the internet? Seriously?

Side_10
Life's too short for all this
obsessive upgrading.

Person_2
You consider the internet an
upgrade? Wow.

Side_10
So why do people gossip about you?

Person_2
Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.

Side_7
You're late for your mother!

Side_7)
The soup kitchen's just up and to
the left, honey.

Person_2
Hobson, this is...
Naomi.

Side_10
She's with you?

Side_7
Delighted to meet you, Naomi.
Normally one has to go to a bowling
alley to meet a woman of your
stature.

Side_10
Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.

Side_7
You aren't the first woman who
walks the streets this young man
has asked.

Side_10
Who's this? Joan Rivers' older
bitterer sister?

Person_2
My nanny.

Side_10
Obviously. Seriously, who is she?

Person_2
My nanny. Well, she started as
that, but these days she's more of
an all-round enforcer and
bodyguard.

Side_10
Sorry, I have to get out the cattle
prod and haul ass. Got another tour
starting in eight minutes.

Person_2
Can I call you?

Side_10
I don't give my number to grown men
with nannies. But as you may not be
a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.

Person_2
But what if this is the one?

Side_7
This is just like the Komodo
dragon. Everyone else is happy to
see one in the zoo and leave it
there. You had to own one. Thank
goodness that handbag manufacturer
was prepared to take the poor
lizard away.

Side_7
He is, Arthur. Are you the only one
allowed to joke now?

Person_2
I don't like it here.

Side_7
Of course you don't. People work
here.

Person_2
Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your
parents are you most like?
Abercrombie or Fitch?

Side_14
I have no connection with that
store. My family name is Von
Krausehoff. Take a seat please.

Side_14
Vivienne?
White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.

Side_7
Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take
long. Then we'll have ice cream.

Side_15
Arthur.

Person_2
Vivienne.

Side_15
You know I prefer `mother'.

Person_2
I'm sorry. You look more like a
Vivienne.

Side_15
So. How are you, Arthur?

Person_2
Quite busy. I have a riding boot
shoot for Petrie Dressage...

Person_2
What else...I'm meeting Ivanka
Trump for brunch to discuss the
environment. She's sending her
helicopter to avoid the traffic...

Person_2
Crashed my Batmobile into the
bronze bull on Wall Street...

Person_2
...which caused a hole to swallow
up the New York Stock Exchange...

Person_2
..the world economy to collapse and
the planet to descend into looting
and cannibalism.

Person_2
What else? Um...tripped over in the
shower this morning. Head split
open, found a family of meerkats
hiding in there! Hated the thought
of the little lads being homeless
so I bricked up the remaining half
of my brain, popped them back in
and Hobson glued my skull back
together.

Person_2
I'm thinking of buying a giant. I
think the market's right for it.

Person_2
You really are a shoddy mother.

Side_15
Did I hear you say you were meeting
Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's
nice. Right. Today we're going to
have a friendly chat. Then a
serious talk. And lastly make a
timetable. How does all that sound?

Person_2
Amazing. Do you have any vodka?

Side_15
What happened, Arthur? You were
such a sweet baby.

Person_2
I still wake up in my own poo
occasionally.

Side_15
Right, that's it for the chat. Time
to transition to our talk.

Side_15
This insanity has to end, Arthur.
As the delightful coffee-coloured
gentleman who runs this country
said, `The time has come to set
aside childish things.'

Person_2
Can't Hobson set them aside for me?

Side_15
Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet
are on the ground, she's of fine
stock...

Side_15
And? You think I spent my marriage
to your father skipping through
meadows?

Person_2
Not after you ran him over in the
Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's
not funny.

Side_15
Ditto your father. The aristocracy
doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur.
It's about stability. Continuity...

Person_2
...and sinking your fangs into
Susan's father's bank account.

Side_15
The Johnson family's considerable
equity in a stormy financial period
is merely a side issue. Burt is a
pillar of the community.

Person_2
His baby formula was taken off the
market in six African countries!

Side_15
A completely innocent error in
places where there's precious
little for children to live for
anyway. The families all got gift
baskets as compensation. That
little bump in the road aside, Burt
is a devout Christian.

Person_2
Yes, because they're never insane.
And where did he get Jesus?

Person_2
He strangled a fireman! Who
strangles a fireman?

Side_15
Arthur...

Person_2
I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met
someone else very lovely who, as
far as I know, isn't related to
anyone who would kill an unsung
hero in cold blood.

Side_15
Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end
of our line. We need an heir.

Person_2
I nearly gave you an heir!

Side_15
Oh, give me strength! A Bach-
Templemead having a child by a lap
dancer called `Mystery'?

Person_2
That was just her stage name! To
give her more mystery when
she...waved her fanny around. Her
real name was...what was it again?

Side_15
Susan is 33 this year. Her egg
inventory has dropped by 23% since
you met her. You risk having no
sons, or worse, some pea-brained
hunchback who hugs everyone!

Person_2
Great! I like hugs! And some of
them are really good at math.
You know the `Frog and Toad' books?

Side_15
No.

Person_2
Of course you don't. Hobson read
them to me while you were off
riding horses over stripey poles.
They're about fun and friendship,
not how many unspasticated tadpoles
I can squirt up a rich girl.

Side_15
Your father would turn in his grave
to hear this nonsense...

Person_2
That I won't follow in his
footsteps and marry a woman I hate?
I think he might climb out of the
grave and dance on it.

Side_15
Suit yourself.

Side_15
My will, which I have updated to
designate Grant in reception as the
sole beneficiary.

Person_2
You wouldn't! You're my...

Side_15
...Vivienne? Try me.

Side_15
Shall we segue to the timetable
part of our meeting?

Side_7
Ah. The ring your father gave your
mother, I recall.

Person_2
Did he knock her out with it, then
drive her to the church in the
trunk of his Bentley?

Side_7
No. Your father was a gentleman.

Person_2
What's gentlemanly about dying
before I knew him? That's just
rude. Did he ever love my mother?

Side_7
They had their days.

Person_2
Ah well. At least he doesn't have
to wake up every day to a woman
with a face like saran wrap
stretched over a gargoyle.

Person_2
What about Naomi?

Side_7
Arthur. I say this with love:

Person_2
Uh-oh...

Side_7
Even by modern male standards
you're a breathtakingly immature
little shit. Coupled with the kind
of money you have access to, that's
deadly. Susan may not have a four
hour stand up routine about the
Flatiron Building, but she's a
solid girl who will look after you.

Person_2
I have you for that.

Side_7
Not forever.

Person_2
Yes forever. You're Hobson.

Side_10
Hello?
Hello?

Person_2
I'm sorry, I've never really
understood that question. Are you
free tomorrow night?

Side_10
Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht.

Person_2
Is that a euphemism for something
naughty?

Side_10
No, it's a lie. I have a creative
writing class. Tonight?

Person_2
I have a contractual commitment.
Friday?

Side_10
You got it.

Person_2
Paper.

Side_10
Sorry?

Person_2
Sorry, I was talking to something
else. So. What do you want to do?

Side_10
A movie?

Person_2
Movie? Come on, you've got to try
harder than that.

Side_10
Pizza.

Person_2
What have you always wanted to do?

Side_10
It's a first date, Arthur. Not our
honeymoon.

Person_2
Every date will be our honeymoon.

Person_2
What sort of food do you like?

Side_10
Anything but guts and mushrooms.
Okay, enough questions.

Person_2
Oh come on. This all helps build up
a profile of you before I trick you
into my basement. I'd hate to not
have your favourite snacks ready.

Side_10
Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done?
Just that I....

Side_7
Time to get engaged, Arthur. The
Komodo dragon can wait.

Person_2
Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?

Side_16
No, sir. It's 8.34.

Person_2
FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can
be a real cunt sometimes, don't you
think? I'll be right back. See you
in an hour and a half ago...

Side_16
Would you care for anything while
you wait?

Person_2
A trampoline and a selection of
woodland creatures if that's not
too much trouble.

Person_2
Ah!
Shhhhh...

Person_2
Bollocks.
Sorry. Actually, you couldn't,
um....you know...
...turn this into a nice 1990
Romanee Conti, could you?

Person_2
Cheers ears.

Person_2
`Genuine Sword of the First
Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.

Person_2
Jesus Fucking Christ!
Sorry. It's not like you shouted
`Arthur Fucking Bach' when they
pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject.

Person_2
Feel the force, Luke.

Side_17
Arthur!

Person_2
I, er, had a bit of food stuck in
my teeth and couldn't find a
toothpick.

Side_17
Heck, this sword went through three
crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems.
Nothing you can do to harm it.

Person_2
You don't, um, have anything
stronger, do you?

Side_17
Sparkling.

Side_17
`The drunkard and the glutton shalt
come to poverty: and drowsiness
shalt clothe a man with rags.'

Person_2
Surely a glass of sherry at
Christmas?

Side_17
Peace be with you.

Person_2
And also with me.

Side_17
Arthur. Can I be honest with you?

Person_2
You're the real Slim Shady? I knew
it!

Side_17
My faith teaches me to hate the
sin, not the sinner. But with you,
I struggle with that belief.

Person_2
You could switch to Judaism.
Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I
put the fan on?

Side_17
Anyway, Arthur. However I feel
about you, my daughter loves you.

Person_2
Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?

Person_2
Let's knock our heads together and
find a way to stop her loving
me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on
the sex offenders register....No, I
am and she knows.
Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay!
I did once dabble actually, so I
can tell a plausible story.

Side_17
You made love to a guy?

Person_2
One Moslem doesn't make a mosque,
Burt.

Side_17
You made love to a Moslem?

Person_2
No, sir, it was Prince Alois of
Lichtenstein and he made love to
me. The fact that it took three
bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
full of Krug to loosen me up
confirmed my heterosexuality.

Side_17
`If there is a man who lies with a
male, they shall surely be put to
death.'

Person_2
Crikey. Couldn't there just be some
kind of on-the-spot fine?

Side_17
You will stop this talk and marry -
my - fucking...

Person_2
Oh bollocks.

Person_2
It's a miracle! He is risen!

Person_2
Hi Susan. Erica.

Side_18
Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I
was talking to your mother. I hear
you have something to ask me!

Person_2
Shall we go?

Person_2
Do you have something with less
words please? The chef doesn't have
to re-cook it, just scrape off the
nouns and trim out all that
gibberish in the middle.

Side_18
He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do
the skate in wood ear mushroom.

Side_19
Excellent decision. Sir?

Person_2
A bowl of champagne and a spoon.

Side_18
Arthur, did you really have to be
so icky to Dominic?

Person_2
I'm sorry. I just can't handle the
whole specials act. It's not a
Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some
heated up dead things that aren't
on the main menu.

Side_18
You know, I was grumbling to your
mother about how things are with us
sometimes. How I'm sure you're
trying to drive me away...

Person_2
Um hm.

Side_18
But she was explaining that
relationships are like property
purchases; invest only in high-end
stock, avoid anyone 'up-and-
coming', then hold onto the
property through thick and thin to
deliver maximum return! Isn't that
darling?

Person_2
Is it possible to buy the house but
then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm
not suggesting pimping you.

Person_2
Look. You after our first child is
born.

Side_18
Arthur. Why can't you learn to
laugh at genuinely amusing things?

Person_2
Such as?

Side_18
YouTube clips of babies giggling.
Dane Cook.

Person_2
Susan. Why are we together?

Side_18
I love you, Arthur. And you love
me, whatever you think.

Person_2
We don't have the same sense of
humour. We don't like the same
films, food, music. You like
horses, I think they're arrogant
idiots...

Side_18
Don't they say opposites attract?

Person_2
That depends on the opposites.
Racists and the Nation of Islam
don't secretly want to 69 each
other. Susan, you're beautiful.
You're bright. You're fucking
loaded. Is there really no one else
who could make you happy?

Side_18
No.

Person_2
Never?

Side_18
Well, I had a thing at college.
That was serious for a while. But
daddy...

Person_2
Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it
not to work out, then shot the
bloke behind a meat truck? Because
Jesus would consider that cheating.

Side_18
Ask me, Arthur.

Person_2
Susan. You're the only woman...at
this table.

Side_18
You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody
who drinks like you can be happy.

Person_2
How do you know? What if the
drunker I get the better it is for
me? Not everyone who drinks is a
poet, Susan. Some of us drink
because we're not poets.

Side_18
A real woman could stop you from
drinking.

Person_2
It'd have to be a real big woman.

Side_18
Ask me, Arthur.

Person_2
Susan. Would you marry me? Take the
weekend if you want...

Side_18
Yes, I'll marry you.

Side_19
Ladies and gentleman - the happy
couple!

Side_18
Erica will be the planner.

Person_2
Erica? She hates me.

Side_18
Who I love, she loves.

Person_2
Oh, come on. She always looks like
she wants to set fire to my face
then put it out with an Uzi.

Person_2
What's going on? I only just bloody
proposed!

Person_2
What have I done, Kitt? This
mistake's up there with Hitler
joining his school debating team...

Side_7
And stop this self-pitying bibble.
You're going to be fabulously rich.

Person_2
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously
poor. Some poor people I see look
happy.

Side_7
That's either because they're far
away or you've just given them
money. Arthur, poor people have to
work. They stand for hours in the
rain, waiting for buses full of
other poor people to take them to
things called `jobs' which they do
all year round to pay for holidays
away from those jobs.

Person_2
Don't patronise me. I have a job.

Side_7
Lying drunk on a bale of hay in
riding boots being photographed by
another pampered prick won't
prepare you for the work I mean.
And I don't want to see you suffer.
Take your fish oil.

Side_20
When are we getting cable?

Side_20
Honey, that's some bullshit aerial
from the 99 cent Store!

Side_10
It's a satellite dish!

Side_20
I read the box! It said `No
satellite fees to pay because does
not receive satellite signals!'
That's like saying `Hey - eat this
plate of broken glass! It won't
make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'

Side_10
It's better than nothing.

Side_20
No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but
you're even cheaper than your mom.
And she bought food from yard
sales.

Side_10
I miss her too, daddy. But now
she's gone and if I'm going to keep
you in grits and Oprah the rest of
your life, you live by my rules.

Side_20
But you live like you're preparing
for a war. And you earn a decent
salary.

Side_10
So? I want to know I can look after
you.

Side_20
What's he do, this English bum?

Side_10
Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.

Side_20
Yeah and I bet that girl said the
same about her date. Honey, stay
home. I don't want you ending up
like that poor girl.

Side_10
A bad actress holding her breath?

Side_10
Stop watching CSI.

Person_2
Or road awareness.

Person_2
Can you put this on please?

Side_10
On a first date? Are you crazy?

Person_2
Trust me.

Side_10
Arthur. We're in Battery Park at
night. I've met you once - in the
company of your nanny. You make a
disturbing number of jokes about
stalking and basements. My dad
already has you down as a mass
murderer. And you want me to put on
a blindfold?

Person_2
I give you my word - if I kill and
eat you, you'll never see me again.

Side_10
Okay, I'm officially a little
worried.

Person_2
You said you wanted a picnic.

Side_10
Arthur, I don't know what to say.
It's beautiful.
Who did all this?

Person_2
The picnic fairies. Who liaised
with the flower fairies, the candle
fairies, the log fire fairies, the
hidden sound system fairies...

Person_2
...and the pizza fairies.

Side_10
Did you take account of the heroin
fairies who hang here at night?

Person_2
It's nice to keep it simple like
this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
restaurants. All that embarrassing
crap with the specials.

Side_10
Are you kidding? Where I normally
eat, the special's the one that
comes with a free toy.

Side_10
You're rich rich, aren't you?

Person_2
I get by.

Side_10
`It doesn't remotely matter how
much or what you spend it on' rich?

Side_10
Craziest thing you ever bought?

Person_2
I once inadvertently financed a
terrorist cell who said they needed
100,000 to open a falafel stall.

Side_10
Oh my G-d, you're serious.

Person_2
What's the craziest thing you ever
told a tour party?

Side_10
I once said the Manhattan we were
in was actually a movie set built
for `You've got Mail', but that
after the film wrapped, everyone
moved to the set because there was
less crime.

Side_10
Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
butter knife about two inches from
his hand but it might take him
eight months to dismember me with
it.
Gotta go, battery. Love you too.

Side_10
Mom died last year. For eight
months dad ate nothing but Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI. So I persuaded him to move in
with me. Where he eats Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of

Person_2
Sounds like you're very good to
him.

Side_10
What are you gonna do? All those
years your folks tucked you in, did
their best to stop you from eating
crap in front of the TV. And then
one day, you're the one saying `No,
honey, it's bad for you! Go to
bed.' Weird, huh?

Person_2
Yeah. I hate that.
Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
find that?

Side_10
AT&T store in 1998.

Person_2
It's...You've had it twelve years?

Side_10
It's a fine phone. Battery life of
eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
right out of conversations.

Side_10
I can't believe these mofos who
gotta keep up with the latest
bullshit. CDs come along, so out
with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
out with the CDs. I just kept the
vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
incredibly hip once every 20
years....

Person_2
I couldn't decide between picnic in
the park and dinner with a view. So
it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
ace?

Side_10
No it is not ace, you crazy English
bastard! This is dangerous!

Person_2
Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put
these on.

Person_2
So what got you into the walking
tours?

Side_10
You're seriously making date small
talk while this is going on?

Person_2
Be still. Breathe deep.
`When you can be calm in the midst
of activity, this is the true state
of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.

Side_10
`Lower this freak show to the
ground and get me a cab': Naomi
Snart.

Person_2
Taste this truffle.

Side_10
What the hell. Gotta go sometime,
right? At least it won't be years
of pain like mom. Just a few
seconds of screaming and falling
with a truffle in my mouth.

Person_2
So anyway. The tours...

Person_2
What did you write?

Side_10
A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
childrens' publisher. Sunshine
Press'. The rejection letter was
the meanest thing I ever read.

Person_2
Kids can be so cruel...

Person_2
I told you, don't worry. These
crane people know what they're
doing!

Side_10
Not that kind of problem.

Side_21
Phone. And the watch. Hurry.

Person_2
Um. Out of interest, how did you
get up here?

Side_21
What you talkin' about, dog?

Side_10
Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed
by `Robbed in the sky'!

Side_10
This isn't funny, you lunatic.

Person_2
OWWW! You don't understand! We're
180 feet up in the sky!

Person_2
No, we're not high! Well we are,
but only in the literal sense.

Person_2
Hurry!

Side_10
I can't find it. Over here?

Person_2
No! That's the bouquet of world
hams!

Person_2
I had fun tonight.

Side_10
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but so did I.

Side_4
Summarising Phase Alpha: formal
wear for bridal attendants, groom's
attendants, mens' formal wear, St
John the Divine all confirmed...

Side_22
I'm sorry?

Person_2
In case I'm passed out drunk rather
than medically dead?

Side_4
Don't worry, Thomas. This whole
thing's just a joke to Arthur.

Side_15
Take this away.
Progress on the reception?

Side_4
Black inked at the Emery Roth Room
at the Ritz-Carlton.

Side_4
A first pass at the guest list.
Bride's family and friends:

Side_4
Groom's family and friends:

Side_4
We can arrange to screen off the
area behind your guests, Arthur. To
make it seem less desperate.

Person_2
Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too
colourful and this hangover's a 7.6
on the Richter..the Sickter...

Side_4
Cakes, caterers, floral
arrangements, photographer...

Side_7
Will there be anything else, sir?

Person_2
No, thanks.

Side_15
No. You can leave.

Person_2
Why all this crap now? What's the
rush anyway?

Side_17
The wedding is in a month, Arthur.

Person_2
A month? I was thinking more sort
of ten, fifteen years. Just to
really enjoy the anticipation of
the big day.

Side_4
Where are you going?

Person_2
Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower,
Operation Ball and Chain will have
to wait.

Person_2
Here we are.

Side_10
We're not going to end up in the
Hudson again, are we?

Person_2
I can promise you won't get wet.

Side_10
Are you okay?

Person_2
Yeah, fine. Actually...

Side_10
Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go
somewhere really romantic?

Person_2
Everything is 99 cents?

Side_10
Yip. A whole penny less than those
bourgeois assholes at the Dollar
Store.

Person_2
`Warning: This product contains
chromium, which may be linked to
chronic bronchitis and reproductive
hazards."

Side_10
That one was on the news. Everyone
else recalled them, the pussies.
Not my 99 Cent!

Person_2
Maybe China's trying to wipe out
the west's children one by one.

Side_10
Oh, I love this place.

Person_2
Why?

Side_10
Well, I'd like you to believe it's
because I'm a poor girl reduced to
buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in-
a-can to Right Said Fred because I
don't know where my next paycheck
is coming from. But the truth is -
bargains get me hot. Got it from
ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?

Person_2
Yes please.

Side_10
Looking west, the ladies' hygiene
products. Note that the more
natural-sounding the name, e.g.
this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine
Spray, the more lethal chemicals it
contains. Watch out for the
products cunningly labelled to make
the dumber consumer think they're
getting the real thing: 'Special
J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt
Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup...

Side_10
And ah, the music: Dated sounds for
lonely people to buy cheap shit to.

Side_10
I once watched a woman shoplift an
8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her
panty hose to 'Everything I do, I
do it for you'.

Side_10
Why are you staring at me?

Person_2
Just fascinated.

Side_10
You're good at fascinated.

Person_2
You're good at fascinating.

Person_2
Are you okay? Let me help you.

Side_23
Not that one.

Person_2
This one?

Side_23
No. There's less beans in it.

Person_2
This one?

Side_23
No.

Person_2
This one?

Person_2
No. I think I hear a mouse inside.

Person_2
Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No
rodents. Packed.

Person_2
Quick, before someone gets it.

Person_2
Look. Us in a year's time.

Person_2
If you got ill, I'd care for you.

Side_10
I'll get ill.

Side_10
Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get
out when they start playing Phil
Collins. Want to see how to get a
quarter from a shopping cart?

Side_4
Tiger Woods has confirmed!

Person_2
I didn't know you knew him.

Side_18
I don't.

Person_2
Why is he coming?

Side_18
He agreed to daddy's fee. This is
going to be the happiest day of my
life!

Side_18
Why is she here all the time?

Person_2
If you can bring Erica, I can bring
Hobson.

Side_18
She's my wedding planner.

Person_2
She's my Hobson.

Person_2
Reminiscent of a French castle
perched 500 feet above New York,
the penthouse was known from early
days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.

Side_10
A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta
have a second ballroom.

Person_2
Where George Gershwin and the
Astors danced to Shep Fields and
his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.

Person_2
Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred
Austere and Stingy Rogers.

Person_2
Behind the telephone box fish tank.
See you on the balcony.

Side_10
Hobson?

Side_7
He's not like other men, you know.

Side_10
I think I realised that as I
plunged into the Hudson with a
junkie. But I like him. He's fun.

Side_7
I know he is. That's the problem.

Side_10
What does that mean?

Side_7
I'm sure Arthur will explain.

Person_2
Your kids' book. What was it about?

Side_10
`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an
asthmatic boy detective.

Person_2
Be serious.

Side_10
Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose
Heart Escaped'. It was about this
kid who wakes up to find his heart
has climbed out and is shinning
down the drainpipe to freedom.

Person_2
I love it.

Side_10
Rainbow Press said it was too
disturbing. But it wasn't literal -
there wasn't a kid lying there with
a gaping hole in his chest. It was
just this cute little heart
bouncing up and down shouting `You
can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm
paraphrasing.

Person_2
Did he catch the heart?

Side_10
Never got that far.

Side_10
You like the hooch, don't you?

Person_2
Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
There's this bit in a book Hobson
used to read me as a kid that says
it all: `We must stop eating
cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he
ate another.'

Side_10
Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and
Toad!

Person_2
So Frog took the box outside. He
shouted in a loud voice, `Hey
birds, here are cookies!' Birds
came from everywhere. They picked
up all the cookies in their beaks
and flew away. `

Person_2
Now we have no more cookies to eat'
`Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going
home now to bake a cake.'
Classic addict.

Side_10
That was beautiful. It's like you
read it yesterday.

Side_7
They ate wet sandwiches without
iced tea. They were two close
friends sitting alone together.

Person_2
I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She
isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my
toad.

Side_7
You're quite sure about this?

Person_2
Yes.

Side_7
Oh, bollocks.

Side_20
I don't know, honey. What's this
teabag even doing here? Couldn't he
make it in Lord of the Rings land?

Side_10
Not that it matters, but he's a
billionaire.

Side_20
You have my full permission to
marry him.

Side_14
Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!

Person_2
I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning
to ride you around the course next.
Her last boyfriend broke his ankle
jumping that ditch. Had to be
destroyed on the spot.

Side_15
Arthur. What's so urgent that you
had to come all the way out here?

Person_2
I'm in love. With a woman who isn't
exactly who you'd describe as
Susan. She's called Naomi.

Side_15
Arthur, we've been through this!

Person_2
Won't you at least meet her?

Side_15
What family is she from?

Person_2
The Snarts of Detroit.

Side_15
Never heard of them.

Person_2
No, because they're normal. She's a
walking tour guide, her dad's a
retired car worker.

Side_15
Susan will generate quality sons,
not oil-soaked car monkeys.

Person_2
Unbelievable! Why don't you just
keep me here, pay a servant to wank
me into a bottle once a day...

Side_15
Arthur...

Person_2
...then inject it all into a field
of heiresses and see who farts out
a thoroughbred first?

Side_15
We need an heir!

Person_2
Fine! You can have one with Stevey
Steroids here! Surely even your
uterus has had a face lift by now.

Person_2
None of your business, J Crew.

Side_14
You are so ungrateful to your
mother. She adores you!

Side_15
Arthur. Come back here.

Person_2
You can shove your inheritance up
your horse's arse!

Side_15
Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your
heart. But do be aware I consider
what you've squandered so far an
advance on your inheritance. That's
about $17 million.

Person_2
Why would you do that? You'd never
get it back.

Side_15
No. But you'd spend the rest of
your life in court. There's a
simple solution to all this. Marry
Susan. And cheat with the nobody
from Queens.

Side_10
Have you been at the cookies?

Person_2
I ate the whole jar.

Side_10
Oh, man. What? What?

Person_2
I'm engaged. To another Susan.
Woman. Engaged to another woman.

Person_2
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

Side_10
What are you talking about? This is
bullshit. Who do you think you are?
Is this some rich guy thing?

Person_2
I was going to tell you! I just...

Side_10
Yeah, yeah, you just.

Person_2
Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it
to get to this! I planned to just
be your friend but then I started
to fall for you and I thought `I
can't marry Susan, I might fall for
Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to
marry Susan or I'll be poor so I
won't fall for Naomi' But then I
did fall for you! Because you're
brainy and funny and gorgeous and
too smart to do walking tours.
You're too smart, Snart. Smart
Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.
Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne,
and I said `I can't marry Susan, I
love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I
don't know any more.

Side_10
You're frog.

Person_2
Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if
you don't marry Susan, I'll make
you pay all the inheritance money
back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.
Okay she didn't laugh but she might
as well have, the evil cow. Because
it's like all the money ever and
they'll put not just me but both of
us in prison and your dad, like in
Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and
Oliver and....

Side_10
Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of
your personality earlier we
wouldn't be having this
conversation.

Person_2
Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?

Side_10
Why?

Person_2
'cause it'll reduce the proportion
of my life I'll spend feeling
utterly miserable.

Side_10
Bye, Arthur.

Person_2
Bea Arthur? What's she got to do
with all this?

Side_10
It's going to be okay. I'll get you
a beer, yeah?

Side_20
I just have to be alone for a
minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear
it...

Side_24
Hey. I got a question.

Side_10
Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants
to come home with me and butt in
with questions while I'm watching
Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'
Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,
long day. What's your question?

Side_24
How can I just let you walk away,
just let you leave without a trace?

Side_25
When I stand here taking every
breath with you, ooh...

Side_26
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.

Side_10
What is going on?

Side_27
How can you just walk away from me,
when all I can do is watch you
leave?

Side_28
'cause we've shared the laughter
and the pain...

Side_29
And even shared the tears.

Side_29
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.

Person_2
So take a look at me now, 'cause
there's just an empty space.
And there's nothing left here to
remind me, just the memory of your
face.

Person_2
Take a look at me now, `cause
there's just an empty space, And
you coming back to me is against
all odds and that's what I've got
to face...Just take a look at me
now.

Side_10
Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.
he's getting married. But I guess
he didn't choreograph that bit for
you.

Person_2
But..but this took ages to
rehearse. I had the frog outfit
specially made. These aren't actual
tourists.

Side_10
I gathered that, Arthur. Are you
capable of doing anything without
it being a grand gesture?

Person_2
What do you mean?

Side_10
It's like Hobson said. You're not
like other men. If you were normal,
if the money and the booze didn't
cloud everything, you'd deal with
the fact that you're engaged,
rather than just looking for ways
to win me back. But it was a lovely
routine, really. Fantastic outfit.

Person_2
I just wanted to see you.

Person_2
Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a
haircut! Hobson?

Side_9
It says here you shouldn't forget
to clean your junk. I guess that's
what...'genitahlio-ah' is.

Person_2
Marty? What are you doing there?

Side_9
Hobson left me in charge. She's
gone to bed. She had a headache.

Person_2
She's had quite a few headaches
lately.

Side_9
She blacked out.

Side_7
Put my bears back on, Arthur.

Person_2
Not until you answer my question.

Side_7
I'm travelling down a white tunnel.
To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why
is it so hot? Who's the red
gentleman with the big pitchfork?

Person_2
Will you cut it out?

Side_7
Arthur. There are three books. This
is important. Take them back to the
library...

Person_2
Hobson, please. Don't die any more.
It's getting very boring.

Side_7
Arthur. Old women, like bears, get
sore heads. Are you okay? You look
a little lost.

Person_2
Naomi doesn't want to see me.

Side_7
A terrible shame she had to go. A
little tart like that could have
saved you a fortune in prostitutes.

Person_2
Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk
about Naomi that way again. What
gives you the right to be such a
snob? You're just...you're just...
Mary Poppins with a menopause!

Person_2
Hobson, I've never raised my voice
to you. I'm sorry.

Side_7
I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur,
you may be growing up.

Person_2
Do you want anything?

Side_7
I want to be younger.

Person_2
Sorry, it's your job to be older.
Hobson. If you're feeling better
tomorrow, will you accompany me
somewhere?

Side_7
Of course, Arthur.

Person_2
I can't have this getting out. I'm
in the public eye.

Side_7
Yes, it would be disastrous to harm
such a dignified profile.

Side_7
It's going to be okay, Arthur.

Side_30
I was waking up four, five, six
mornings a week in different mens'
beds...

Side_30
I wanted to die. To be nobody.

Side_31
I steal from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's pedal car so I
could score junk...

Person_2
Jesus....

Side_31
I accidentally backed my car over
my mother outside Walgreens...

Person_2
Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know
about anyone else, but this isn't
exactly killing my thirst.

Side_32
Well why did you come...What's your
name?

Person_2
Gandalf.

Person_2
I'm sorry, you're not going to
convince me my life isn't fun.
And no offence but if I ran over my
mother, I'd be out celebrating.
Which is what I plan to do right
now. Come on, Hobson. Marty.

Side_7
...and because I have done nothing
with the astonishing opportunities
handed to me, apart from pissing
away my inheritance and drinking
enough to kill a rhino.

Side_7
But imagine being me! I once ended
up in bed with the daughters of
three of the Rolling Stones. But a)
I don't remember a thing about it,
b) apparently I was sick on two of
the women before c) losing control
of my bladder on the third. All
such fun...until the strangers I
pay to be my friends have gone, the
fog parts and there's a hole so
big, you could pour all the
champagne in the world into it and
never fill it up. But I've got so
much potential, a good heart, I'm a
good person, even if I've
completely wasted my short,
precious life because I somehow
convinced myself that happiness is
a Komodo dragon, a case of booze
and the memory of having once
stripped naked to Beethoven for a
coachload of German tourists who I
met outside the Rainforest Cafe.

Person_2
It's always the quiet ones.

Person_2
Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go
every time I crave a drink?

Person_2
Susan? Look, I know the wedding
date is set. But fancy bringing it
forward? I just want to get it over
with. In a good way. Think about
it, yeah?

Person_2
It's the agony of possibility,
Hobson. It just hurts too much to
know I could still be with Naomi if
I had the guts.

Side_7
Just promise you'll never ask me to
sleep with Susan for you.

Side_10
Arthur, if that's...
Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.
Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty
hard on it..Love to...Love
to...What time?

Side_10
I'll call in dead to work. Bye.

Side_7
Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi
here?

Side_20
You must be the nanny.

Side_7
I must be.

Side_7
Please stop this, I can't inhale
and am in danger of treading on one
of your knuckles.

Side_7
If you and your undershirt would
walk two paces back I could enter
this dwelling.

Side_10
Well, well.

Side_20
Ever since I met Arthur I liked
him. We have to make sure these two
wonderful kids stay together...

Side_7
Try not to talk. It's not your
words but the breath which bears
them. Perhaps you could repair to
the East Wing and make me a cup of
tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.

Side_20
Sure, sure.

Side_7
Arthur is having a pre-wedding
party tonight. You should come.

Side_10
Oh, should I? Are all the other
girls he passed up going too?

Side_7
Don't you want to show Arthur how
well you're doing?

Side_10
Tell him thanks, but I have a
deadline.

Side_7
Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's
far too decent to be involved in
something so tawdry. You could
bring your father. A magical
experience before he's too big to
leave this apartment.

Side_7
My dear, if there's one thing old
women can tell, it's young men in
love. And the food promises to be
breathtakingly free.

Side_10
Are you alright?

Side_7
Better than you, dear.

Side_10
You really look out for Arthur,
don't you?

Side_7
Yes. And it is a job that I
recommend highly.

Side_7
You really look out for this
gentleman, from what I've heard.

Side_10
Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill
pet shelter won't take him.

Side_7
Thank you. Would you go the
bathroom and commence washing? You
only have three hours and it could
be quite a project.

Side_10
I appreciate what you're trying to
do but I'm not going to that party.

Side_7
Suit yourself.

Side_10
Have you seen a doctor?

Side_7
Yes. And he has seen me.

Side_10
I think Arthur has a very good
friend. May I kiss you on the
cheek?

Side_7
Is it something you feel strongly
about?

Side_10
Yes.

Side_10
Dad! Call 911.

Side_33
Thanks. We're going to move things
up tempo now with `The Only Thing
That Looks Good On Me Is You.'

Side_15
Splendid affair, Susan.

Side_18
Don't thank me, thank Erica.

Side_10
With all due respect, Hobson,
you're talking out of your frumpy
English ass. Arthur needs to know!

Side_7
You are not to pull him out of that
party on my behalf.
Hello? Naomi!

Side_20
You're gonna get through this,
babe. Then who knows what the
future may hold?

Side_34
Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?

Side_10
Snart plus one.

Side_35
Nice dress. Vera Wang?

Side_10
Ross Dress For Less. You know where
Arthur is?

Side_17
When Arthur proposed to my
daughter, I was overjoyous. The
Bach-Templemeads are my kind of
people: classy. Respectable. Well
spoken. People like in Shakespeare
in Love, who esprouse the same
values I have always upheld both in
my business and spiritual life. But
tonight isn't about me or America's
leading independent formula brand.

Person_2
Thank you, Burt! I've actually
prepared a little surprise song
with my friends here.

Person_2
Why does cash suddenly appear,
every time you are near?

Person_2
Just like me, it longs to be, close
to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the
sky, all of which, I can buy...
I'll sing a proper song.
You say potayto and I say potahto,
You say tomayto and I say tomahto,
potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto,
Let's call the whole thing off! You
say AA, and I say `no way', you say
`Red Bull' and I say `Go away,
Rehab, No way, Red Bull...

Side_36
We meet again!

Side_10
Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?

Side_36
The ballroom. I'll take you to him.

Side_36
I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.

Side_36
Isn't she beautiful?

Side_10
Of course she is. Why would Arthur
marry a pig?

Side_36
What business is your family in?

Side_10
Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a
fortune built on small pets.

Side_36
I'm sorry?

Side_10
Hamsters, mice, doglets...

Side_36
Doglets?

Side_10
Tiny dogs. The technology's not
perfect. Seeing a horse the size of
a can of soup fall dead before your
eyes - that shit stays with you.

Side_10
Are you sure he's this way?

Side_36
Absolutely.

Side_10
Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?

Side_37
That way. The ballroom.

Side_10
Bye, Justin.

Side_34
Excuse me, madam. You're not an
authorized guest.

Side_10
I know that. I'm here to give
Arthur some very important news.

Side_34
Of course you are.
Shall we discuss this outside?

Person_2
It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.

Side_10
Arthur, can I talk to you?

Side_38
We ran tests. It was just a dizzy
spell. We'll be sending her home
tonight.

Person_2
But what about the other blackouts?

Side_7
Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that
party.

Person_2
She's fine. They're sending her
home. Do you want a drink?

Side_10
No, thanks, Arthur. I should go.

Person_2
But you came all this way. There's
ridiculously fancy food, there's...

Side_10
Arthur. Please. Can you just call
me a cab?

Person_2
You're a cab.

Person_2
Shit. Hobson usually...

Side_10
Orders cabs to take the girls away?

Person_2
Thank you for coming all this way.
I'm sorry for all the stupid
presents and calls and gestures.

Side_10
It's okay.

Side_10
She was a looker from the get-go.

Person_2
What were you like as a kid?

Side_10
Nuts. I thought the moon followed
me. I would walk and think the moon
went any place that I did. I
thought it meant something special
would happen. So I've been waiting.
What an ass.

Person_2
Dance?

Side_10
Arthur. We've been through this.
Call that cab please.

Side_39
To Bombay, a travelling circus
came, they brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her name...

Person_2
Hobson used to sing it to me.
One dark night, she slipped her
iron chain. Off she ran to
Hindustan and was never seen again.
Nellie the Elephant packed her
bags, And said goodbye to the
circus, Off she went with a
trumpety trump, Trump trump
trump...

Side_15
Is this the tour guide?

Person_2
She's a writer.

Side_10
Is this the Vivienne?

Side_15
Crowded field, writing.

Person_2
Maybe someone will see her
potential.

Side_15
We all know who's seen her
potential.

Side_10
Meaning?

Side_15
Oh, of course, you don't know, do
you?

Person_2
Vivienne, please. Don't...

Side_10
What is going on here?

Side_15
My son became fond of you. You're
not the first. Or the last, I
imagine. Anyway I was scanning his
monthly expenses - which always
makes for entertaining reading, all
those gifts for all those girls -
and found he'd bought an entire
publishing company called...what
was it now? Rainbow Press.

Side_10
You bought Rainbow press? So you
could tell them to publish my book?

Side_15
He knows people, dear. I'm sure you
do too, though the people you know
tend not to own books, let alone
publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll
see you back at the party? Susan's
a little worried.

Person_2
NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I
would ever see you again. I was
just trying to give you some...

Person_2
I do express love! I love you!

Side_10
Don't say that!

Person_2
You just told me to! And stop going
on about me being rich! You think
it's easy being trapped by money?

Side_10
Hello, Amnesty? Come quick!
Arthur's being held against his
will in Guantamoney Bay!

Person_2
Abu Greed?

Side_10
Stop riffing with me! How dare you
do what you did. I didn't need your
money to feel good about myself!

Person_2
No. Being cheap gives you that.

Side_10
Huh?

Person_2
At least I'm prepared to have fun.
To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at
me with my antique food, aren't I
cool?' And...and...your phone's
RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old
doorbell and vibrator, I bet you
can only get calls from 1994 on it!

Side_18
Hello? I heard shouting.

Side_10
I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came
to complain about the conditions.

Person_2
Naomi, please...

Side_10
Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you
thought putting half and half in
the staff kitchen was an
improvement.
But some people prefer Coffee Mate!
You were disrespectful. I quit!

Side_18
Because you changed the creamer?
Arthur, Marty called from the
hospital.

Person_2
It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke
to her doctor.

Side_18
Apparently you didn't.

Side_7
It's just a headache!

Person_2
Stop saying that! You bribed a
hospital orderly to tell me you
were okay!

Side_7
Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors
know?

Person_2
Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing
costly, health-giving presents!

Person_2
'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'..
`A compilation of the band's most
stomach-churning music videos and
deathly live performances...'

Person_2
Put this on, please.

Side_7
I don't want to put it on.

Person_2
Put it on. Or I'll fire you.
Okay, or I won't fire you.

Side_9
She sounds like Darth Invader!

Side_7
Why, Arthur?

Side_40
...is determined to catch the
salmon, despite the treacherous
rapids...

Side_41
Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a
moment?

Person_2
Home? That's great news. Isn't it?

Person_2
How did this get here?

Side_7
I have no idea.

Person_2
You might have a brain tumour but
you're not a complete veggie burger
just yet. Has Naomi been here?

Side_7
She dropped by once or twice.
Frightful needy trollop.

Person_2
I thought she gave up writing.

Side_7
Just trying to spare her outright
humiliation while I'm still here.

Person_2
Don't wear yourself out. You're not
going anywhere soon.

Person_2
World's most advanced heart rate
monitor. The tiniest problem will
alert your own private platoon of
paramedics camped out downstairs...

Side_7
Arthur. I've loved caring for you
so much. But you'll never grow up
with me around. So either I retire.
Or I die. Option 1 involves too
much paperwork and blather with
having to find somewhere else to
live. And no offence to you, dear
boy...

Side_7
...but I think we've exhausted the
bear-based entertainment. Which
leaves option 2.

Side_7
You're a good son, Arthur. You can
do anything with your life that you
want. Just like I did.

Person_2
But you spent half of it looking
after a spoilt drunk twat.

Side_7
Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my
use-by date.

Person_2
Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this
one. I need you to care for me.
Now take your fish oil.

Person_2
Hobson?

Side_7!
Why the fuck has the stupid thing
not gone off?

Person_2
Would Frog ever get up again? Or
would he just sit in his tank,
crying and soiling himself until he
died of dehydration because he
didn't even have the energy to eat
a wet sandwich.

Person_2
Hobson! Why are you in there when I
need you?

Person_2
Arrrrgghhh!

Person_2
Sorry.

Side_9
How's the tea?

Person_2
Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.

Side_9
Want to talk about the Cubs game?

Person_2
Nahhh. Can I be alone please?

Person_2
Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get
this, because your voicemail
probably consists of a 4000 year
old woman who writes the message
down in hieroglyphics then loses it
down the back of her incontinence
loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson
died and I've fallen apart...

Person_2
Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?

Side_15
Arthur! You haven't answered the
phone for eight days. Susan's
beside herself. What's going on?

Person_2
What do you think's going on?
Hobson died.

Side_15
Oh, that.

Person_2
You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?

Side_15
Well, yes. A faithful, humble
companion who...

Person_2
Um, I think I'd like you to leave,
if that's okay. Now?

Side_15
Remember who pays for this
apartment, Arthur. For everything!

Side_15
You had damn well better be at that
wedding, boy.

Person_2
Don't worry. If I'm going to drink
myself to death I'll need
resources. Bye Vivienne...

Side_15
It's mother!

Person_2
My mother's dead.

Person_2
Hello? I'm sorry?

Side_43
The last will and testament of Jane
Hobson.
`I leave my life savings to the
Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare
County, California.'

Person_2
That'll explain the strong smell of
bear shit. Sorry.

Side_43
To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave
this.

Side_43
To operate kettle, press red
button. Milk in refrigerator;
that's the big box with the pretty
light that comes on when you open
the door.
Arthur. You're going to be okay.
Now it's your turn to look after
someone. All my deepest, fondest
love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling
down at you - or more likely, up at
you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx.

Side_17
I just want you to know, if he
doesn't show up for this wedding, I
can't know what I'll do.

Side_15
Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned
himself up. He's stopped drinking,
he's anxious to get a real job.
He's become a responsible citizen.

Side_10
Due to a tragic error in the
architect's drawing, the original
Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886
was just seven inches tall. 100,000
New Yorkers rioted, having come
expecting to see something more
impressive than a garden gnome
holding up an ice cream...

Person_2
Naomi!

Person_2
You're on a bus? With a microphone?

Side_10
Girl's gotta have a dream.

Person_2
Naomi. Can you take the next 60
years off?

Side_10
Are you okay? You're a mess. You
look like you...now.

Person_2
Sorry. I accidentally swallowed
three bottles of hand sanitizer.
Fascinating story...Okay.

Person_2
Drinking was the only way I could
get the courage to come here and
say this: I don't need the money. I
love the money. But I don't lie
awake all night wondering how I'll
live without ever seeing it again.
I just wonder what it's like to go
24 hours without a steak tartare.

Person_2
The American Express Centurion card
- you have to spend at least
$250,000 a year to keep it, which I
blow in a quiet week.

Person_2
Sotheby's `World Elite' Mastercard
for art collectors.

Person_2
Side_44
And King of all idiotic reckless-
insanity: the Visa Black Card.

Person_2
PIN 3487. Daily ATM limit $180,000.

Person_2
The world's only platinum iPhone.
With police radio app.

Person_2
Alexander Amosu. Vicuna wool, shorn
once every three years from the
South American camelid - $50,000.

Person_2
Westmancott trousers, ten months to
design, fit and make. $21,000.

Person_2
These are from The Gap.

Side_10
I'm so sorry about Hobson.

Person_2
I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.

Side_10
It's okay. So how did Susan take it
that you're not marrying her?

Person_2
She didn't.

Side_10
You haven't told her?

Person_2
What's it to you? She's your arch-
enemy.

Side_10
Are you six? She isn't my enemy.
She's the woman you proposed to!

Person_2
I couldn't tell her! Today's the
biggest day of her life!

Side_10
The wedding's today? When?

Person_2
12. Which is...
Where's my watch gone?

Side_10
It's eight minutes to.

Person_2
It's too late, then.

Person_2
I don't know her number! It's in my
phone's address book in that gloop.

Side_10
Church?

Person_2
St. John the Divine. Can we please
just get me some clothes...

Side_10
St John..Fourth largest church in
the world...111th and Amsterdam.
It's about four miles. Better
hurry.

Person_2
You want me to go there? Like this?

Side_10
What's the alternative? Jilt Susan
at the altar? Can I expect the same
treatment when you dump me?

Person_2
No! I love you!

Side_10
C'mon, folks...

Person_2
Naomi! Susan's dad will...

Side_10
Arthur. Prove you're not the same
pampered little boy who can have
what he wants then toss it aside
when he's bored. Then we'll talk.

Person_2
Naomi! I don't even know the way!

Side_10
5th...right on Broadway...left at
Times...Right on 7th...back on
Broadway....right on Amsterdam. The
church is the big stone pointy
thing full of rich people.

Person_2
Um, can anyone spare...
How much to St. John the Divine
please?

Side_45
About 15 bucks...

Person_2
Can anyone spare $15 please?

Side_45
What about tip? You cheapskate?

Person_2
Stop! STOP!

Person_2
`Chicken forgetting birthday'...

Person_2
How far can I go with $1.95 and a
Japanese coin with a hole in it?

Side_45
A block and a half.

Side_46
Yes.

Person_2
Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother
you, but...

Person_2
Crikey. Thanks.

Side_10
...originally a rough
neighbourhood. Some say it was
called 42nd Street because it
wasn't safe to spend more than
forty seconds on it.

Side_47
Excuse me.

Side_10
If you burst into song, you're off
this bus.

Side_47
Huh? I want to see St. John the
Divine.

Side_10
Sorry, sir, that's not on our route
today. Anyway...

Side_25
I want to know if Arthur's gonna
make it.

Side_48
You should be there for him.

Side_49
So do I! St. John the Divine, St.
John the Divine, St. John the...

Side_10
Okay!

Person_2
Ah! I'm trying to get to...

Side_50
Hey!

Person_2
I'm not him.
Look ma! No holes.

Side_18
Arthur? What's going on?

Person_2
Susan. I can't...I can't...

Side_18
What?

Person_2
The girl at the party? The one who
talked all that rubbish about
Coffee Mate? I love her.

Side_18
Shut up! We're getting married!

Person_2
But I don't love you!

Side_18
And you think I love you?

Person_2
Well, yes. What's not to...

Side_18
I never have.

Person_2
Susan, you're upset, you hate me.
It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to
go, or your dad's going to do
whatever he did to your boyfriend
from college.

Side_18
Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her
parents to send her away..

Person_2
HER? You're..a...

Side_18
Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed
that daddy is homophobic. He swore
he'd disown me if it happened
again.

Person_2
But...why do you want to marry...

Person_2
Hang on. Am I your beard?

Side_18
Why else do you think I'd spend
more than 30 seconds in your
company? You're the perfect cover.

Side_18
No.

Person_2
Wow. Wow. Well. Uh...
Thanks for your honesty. I don't
feel so bad about calling this off.

Side_18
Arthur, please. You can drink as
much as you like, sneak off to
Naomi. We keep the money. We live
our lives. Everyone wins.

Person_2
I may be a weak, pathetic drunk.
But I won't marry a lesbian Dane
Cook fan.

Person_2
Good evening, St. John the Divine!
Anyone in from St. Patrick's?
Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan
Mosque? AA?

Person_2
...and the first turned to the
second horse and said `That dog
just spoke'.

Person_2
The joke being that it's
inconsistent that the horses can
speak but the dog can't.

Person_2
The wedding's off. The bride has
had second thoughts. I can't say I
blame her. Would you marry me?

Person_2
Great. I'm glad we had this talk.
I'll let you get on with the
wedding....

Side_18
Daddy, no! Stop it!

Side_15
Burt! Get off my son!

Side_18
Side_17
You wouldn't hurt me.

Side_18
Wouldn't I? You crushed me.

Side_17
I just wanted you to be happy.

Side_18
Bullshit. You wanted to stop me
being a lesbian!

Side_17
Shut up! Shut up you dirty little
dyke harlot!

Side_4
You want some more, bitch? Huh?

Side_18
Erica, that's enough, honey.

Person_2
Why didn't you tell me? We could
have worked something out.

Person_2
I'm joking.

Person_2
OW! Stop it! Why are you doing
that?

Side_10
Because I hate an infection! Keep
still.

Person_2
No, you keep still.

Side_10
What are we going to do, Arthur?

Person_2
I'll get a job. I'll model cheap
riding boots for people with no
horses. You can write books about
boys whose lungs have run away.

Side_15
Stop this!

Side_15
A Bach-Templemead has never been
poor and we're not about to try
that experiment with you, Arthur.
That said, you've shown strength of
character for once, instead of
blubbing on about frogs and
friendship. The inheritance is
yours. All I ask is, with Hobson
gone, you finally start treating me
like a mother.

Person_2
Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.

Side_15
I beg your pardon?

Person_2
You've never earned that title. I
wouldn't fake it with Susan. I
won't with you.

Side_15
Arthur. I will withdraw this offer
forever. Don't doubt me, boy.

Person_2
I don't.

Person_2
Take care, Viv.

Side_15
Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If
you walk out of that door...

Person_2
Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any
more. Fancy joining us for a bowl
of Special J?

Person_2
Operational heat controls in a
shower are a basic human right!

Person_2
What the hell's in this shampoo?
Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea
tree oil...

Side_20
Package for you. With any luck an
apartment for you and Lurch.

Person_2
I thought you liked me.

Side_20
I may have been seduced by money.
It happens.

Person_2
`Can I be your friend at least?
Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch
sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is
yours. It always was.'

Side_20
On balance, I'd go for it.

Side_9
Money good.

Side_10
You were never happy rich, honey.
It's only been a month. Be strong.
Remember: however hard life gets,
love will always find a way.

Side_10
What? Can't a girl make a joke?

Person_2
Brought her for moral support. But
I'll do the talking this time.

Person_1
Thebes. City of the Living. Crown
jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

Person_1
Home of Imhotep, High Priest of
Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

Person_1
Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's
Mistress. No other man was allowed
to touch her.

Person_1
But for our love, we were willing to
risk life itself.

Person_2
What are you doing here?

Person_2
Imhotep?... My priest.

Person_3
Pharaoh's bodyguards!

Person_4
You must go. Save yourself. Only you
can resurrect me.

Person_4
My body is no longer his temple!

Person_1/IMHOTEP
For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's
body was to be cursed. And it was I,
the High Priest, whose duty it was
to curse it.

Person_6
Her body was mummified, her vital
organs removed and placed in sacred
canopic jars.

Person_6
The Book of The Living contained
sacred incantations that would send
the evil dead on a journey into the
dark underworld.

Person_6
The slaves were killed...

Person_6
...and the soldiers who killed them
were also slain, so that no unholy
person should ever know the exact
location of the burial site.

Person_6
But there was another book, The Book
Of The Dead, which was never to be
opened, never to be read, for it
contained the incantations that could
bring a dead body back to life a
most unholy thing.

Person_6
It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of
the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis,
so that no such sacrilege might ever
disgrace Egypt.

Person_6
But for my love of Anck-su-namun I
was willing to defy the gods.

Person_6
Anck-su-namun's vital organs were
still fresh, so a human sacrifice
would not need be made.

Person_6
Anck-su-namun soul had come back
from the dead! Now all that was
needed, was to return her organs to
their rightful place within her body.

Person_6
My Priests were condemned to be
mummified alive.

Person_6
As for me, I was condemned to endure
the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient
curses. One so horrible, it had never
before been bestowed.

Person_6
By eating the sacred scarabs, I would
be cursed to stay alive forever. And
by eating me, they were cursed just
the same.

Person_6
I was to remain sealed inside my
sarcophagus, the undead for all of
eternity.

Person_6
They would never allow me to be
released. For I would arise a walking
disease, a plague upon mankind, an
unholy flesh-eater, with the strength
of ages, power over the sands, and
the glory of invincibility.

Person_6
And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
su-namun from her place in hell,
together, we would be an unstoppable
infection upon this world. The
Apocalypse. The End.

Person_7
I knew this was gonna be a lousy
day.

Person_8
Personally, I would like to surrender.
Why can we not just surrender?

Person_7
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

Person_8
Then let's run away. Right now. While
we can still make it.

Person_7
Now gimme your revolver, you'll never
use it anyway.

Person_8
Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody
ever does that anymore.

Person_7
Now go find me a big stick.

Person_8
In the desert? What for?

Person_7
So I can tie it to your back, you
appear to be without a spine.

Person_7
How'd a guy like you end up in the
Legion anyways?

Person_8
I got caught robbing a synagogue.
Lots of good stuff in them holy
places; churches, temples, mosques,
and who's guarding them?

Person_7
Altar boys?

Person_8
Exactly! I speak seven languages,
including Hebrew, so my specialty
was synagogues. How about you? Kill
somebody?

Person_7
No, but I'm considering it.

Person_8
What then? Robbery? Extortion?
Kidnapping!

Person_7
None of the above, thank you.

Person_8
Then what the hell are you doing
here!?

Person_7
I was just looking for a good time.

Person_7
Oh shit. Steady!

Person_9
What the hell am I sayin'?

Person_9!
What the hell am I doin'?

Person_7
Son-of-a-bitch.

Person_7
Hey! Beni! Wait up!

Person_7
What are ya doing?! Wait up!

Person_7
Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU

Person_7
I'm gonna get you for this!

Side_2
Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up
here?

Side_2
Oops.

Side_3
Look at this! Sons of the Messiah!
Give me frogs, flies, locusts,
anything but this! Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

Side_2
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

Side_3
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it
was an accident. You are a
catastrophe! Why do I put up with
you?

Side_2
You put up with me, because I can
read and write ancient Egyptian,
decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic,
and I'm the only person within a
thousand miles who knows how to
properly code and catalogue this
library.

Side_3
Who needs smart women? I put up with
you because your mother and father
were our finest patrons, Allah rest
their souls. Now straighten up this
mess!

Side_2
Hello?

Side_2
Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

Side_2
You...! YOU...!

Side_4
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please
call me something original.

Side_2
Have you no respect for the dead?

Side_4
Right now, I only wish to join them.

Side_2
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather
than later, before you ruin my career
the way you've ruined yours.

Side_4
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll
have you know, that at this moment
my career is on a high note.

Side_2
High note? Ha! For five years you've
been scrounging around Egypt, and
what have you to show for it? Nothing.

Side_4
Oh yes I do! I have something right
here!

Side_2
Oh no, not another worthless trinket,
Jonathan, if I bring one more piece
of junk to the Curator to try and
sell for you.

Side_2
Where did you get this?

Side_4
On a dig, down in Thebes.

Side_4
My whole life I've never found
anything, Evy. Tell me I've found
something.

Side_2
Jonathan?

Side_4
Yes?

Side_2
I think you found something.

Side_2
See the cartouche there, it's the
official royal seal of Seti the First,
I'm sure of it.

Side_3
Perhaps.

Side_4
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti
the First? And was he rich?

Side_2
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old
Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest
Pharaoh of them all.

Side_4
Alright, good, that's good. I like
this fellow, like him very much.

Side_2
I've already dated it, this map is
almost four thousand years old. And
the hieratics over here...
It's Hamunaptra.

Side_3
My dear girl, don't be ridiculous,
we are scholars, not treasure hunters.
Hamunaptra is a myth.

Side_4
Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

Side_2
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the
early Pharaohs were said to have
hidden the wealth of Egypt.

Side_4
Right, right, in a big underground
treasure chamber. Everybody knows
the story. The entire necropolis was
rigged to sink into the sand. On
Pharaoh's command, a flick of the
switch! And the whole place could
disappear beneath the dunes.

Side_2
All we know is that the city
mysteriously vanished around 2,134

Side_3
As the Americans would say: it's all
fairy tales and hokum.

Side_4
You burned it! You burned off the
part with the lost city!

Side_3
It's for the best, I'm sure. Many
men have wasted their lives in the
foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no
one has ever found it, most have
never returned.

Side_4
You killed my map.

Side_3
I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm
surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to
be so fooled.

Side_2
You told me you found it on a dig
down in Thebes!

Side_4
I was mistaken.

Side_2
You lied to me!

Side_4
I lie to everybody, what makes you
so special?

Side_2
I'm your sister.

Side_4
That just makes you more gullible.

Side_2
You stole it from a drunk at the
local Casbah?!

Side_4
Picked his pocket, actually.

Side_2
And what is he in prison for?

Side_5
I did not know, so when I heard you
were coming, I asked him that myself.

Side_2
And what did he say?

Side_5
He said... he was just looking for a
good time.

Side_2
But he's just a filthy criminal?

Side_4
Way to go, Evy.

Person_7
So who's the broad?

Side_2
Broad?!

Side_4
She's my sister, actually.

Person_7
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a
total loss.

Side_5
I'll be back in a moment.

Person_7
I tremble with anticipation.

Side_2
We uh,... found... your puzzle box,
and we've come to ask you about it.

Person_7
No.

Side_2
No?

Person_7
No... You came to ask me about
Hamunaptra.

Side_2
How do you know the box pertains to
Hamunaptra?

Person_7
Because that's where I found it. I
was there.

Side_4
How do we know that's not a load of
pig swallow?

Person_7
Hey,... don't I know you?

Side_4
Um, well, you see...

Side_2
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

Person_7
I just decked your brother

Side_2
Yes, well...
I know my brother.

Person_7
Yeah, I was there.

Side_2
You swear?

Person_7
Every damn day.

Side_2
No, I mean --

Person_7
-- I know what you mean. I was there,
alright. Seti's place. The City Of
The Dead.

Side_2
What did you find? What did you see?

Person_7
I found sand. I saw death.

Side_2
Could you tell me how to get there?
The exact location?

Person_7
Want to know?

Side_2
Yes.

Person_7
Really want to know?

Side_2
Yes.

Person_7
Then get me the hell outta here.

Side_2
Where are they taking him?

Side_5
To be hanged.

Side_5
Apparently, he had a very good time.

Side_5
No women allowed.

Side_2
I am an English woman.

Side_2
I will give you one hundred pounds
to spare his life.

Side_5
I would pay one hundred pounds just
to see him hang.

Side_2
Two hundred pounds.

Side_5
Proceed!

Side_2
Three hundred pounds!

Side_6
Any last requests, pig?

Person_7
Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

Side_5
And what else?

Side_5
His neck did not break! Good! Now we
watch him strangle to death.

Side_2
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

Side_5
You lie.

Side_2
I would never!

Side_5
Are you saying this filthy godless
son of a pig knows where to find The
City Of The Dead? Truly?

Side_2
Yes and if you cut him down, we will
give you ten percent.

Side_5
Fifty percent.

Side_2
Twenty.

Side_5
Forty.

Person_7
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--

Side_2
Twenty-five percent, and not one
single farthing more.

Side_3
She must die.

Side_7
She is like all the others. She will
die in the desert.

Side_3
No! She has seen too much. She knows
too much.

Side_3
Not only does she have a map, but
she has the key.

Side_7
The key!? She has the lost key!?

Side_3
Yes. No one has ever had so much,
been so close. We must stop her, or
it will be the end of us all.

Side_7
Then we will kill her, we will kill
her and all those with her.

Side_3
And burn the map and retrieve the
key.

Side_7
It will be done. But what of the
American expedition? They leave
tomorrow as well.

Side_3
Forget the bumbling Americans, they
will be like all the others. Without
the map to guide them, how can they
possibly find Hamunaptra?

Person_8
It is three days down the Nile, then
two days by camel, sahibs.

Side_8
For all the money we're paying you,
something better god-damned well be
under that sand.

Side_9
"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya
gotta keep sayin, to yourself,
"Hamunaptra."

Side_2
Do you really think he'll show up?

Side_4
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he
may be a cowboy, but his word is his
word.

Side_2
Personally, I think he's filthy,
rude and a complete scoundrel. I
don't like him one bit.

Side_2
Oh... um,... hello.

Side_4
Smashing day for the start of an
adventure, eh, O'Connell?

Person_7
Yeah, sure, smashing.

Side_10
You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

Person_8
Along with the scorched bones of my
entire garrison, sahib.

Person_8
A thousand pardons, my good sahibs
but there is much work to be done.

Side_2
Mister O'Connell, can you look me in
the eye, and guarantee me this is
not some sort of flimflam? Because
if it is, I'm warning you --

Person_7
All I can tell you, miss, is that my
Colonel found that map in an ancient
fortress, and the whole damn garrison
believed in it so much, that without
orders, we marched halfway across
Libya and into Egypt to find that
city. Like I told ya, all I saw was
sand. Everybody else was wiped out
by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your
bags.

Side_4
Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude,
a complete scoundrel, nothing to
like there at all.

Side_5
A bright good morning to all.

Side_2
What are you doing here?

Side_5
I have come to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

Side_4
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we
could use another good player.

Person_7
I only gamble with my life, never my
money.

Side_8
Never? What if I were to wager five
hundred dollars says we get to
Hamunaptra before you?

Person_7
Yer on.

Side_10
What makes you so confident, sir?

Person_7
What makes you?

Side_9
We got us a man who's actually been
there.

Side_4
I say, what a coincidence, why --

Side_4
-- whose deal is it? Is it my deal?
I thought I just dealt?

Person_7
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

Side_2
The only thing that scares me, Mister
O'Connell, are your manners.

Person_7
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

Side_2
If you call that a kiss.

Side_2
Did I miss something? Are we going
into battle?

Person_7
The last time I was at that place
everybody I was with died.

Person_7
There's something out there, you
know, something under that sand.

Side_2
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain
artifact, a book, actually, my brother
thinks there's treasure. What do you
think is out there?

Person_7
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,
they call it, "the doorway to hell."

Side_2
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to
the underworld", actually.

Side_2
I don't believe in fairy tales and
hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do
believe that one of the most famous
books in history is buried out there,
The Book Of The Living. It's what
first interested me in Egypt as a
child. It's why I came here, sort of
a life's pursuit.

Person_7
And the fact that they say it's made
out of pure gold, makes no nevermind
to you, right?

Side_2
You know your history.

Person_7
I know my treasure.

Side_2
By the way,... why did you kiss me?

Person_7
I was about to be hanged, seemed
like a good idea at the time.

Person_7
What?... Wha'd I say?

Person_8
My very good friend! What a surprise.

Person_7
Why if it ain't my little buddy,
Beni. I oughta kill you.

Person_8
You never were any good with the
ladies, O'Connell.

Person_7
So you're the one leading the
Americans, I shoulda figured. So
what's the scam? You get 'em out in
the middle of the desert then leave
'em to rot?

Person_8
Unfortunately no, these Americans
are smart, they pay me only half
now, half when I get them back to
Cairo, so I must go all the way.

Person_8
You never believed in Hamunaptra,
O'Connell. Why are you going back?
The devil himself lives out there.

Person_7
The girl saved my life, figured it
was the least I could do, keep her
out of trouble.

Person_8
You always did have more balls than
brains.

Person_7
Let's make us even, shall we?

Person_8
Even?

Person_7
Sounds familiar.

Side_7
Where is the map?

Side_7
And the key? Where is the key?

Side_7
Then I'll find it myself.

Person_7
Friend of yours?

Side_2
The map! We need the map!

Person_7
Relax! I'm the map!
It's all up here.

Side_2
Oh that's comforting.

Person_7
C'mon, there's still one more of
those guys around here somewhere.

Side_4
Hey that's mine --

Person_7
Can you swim?

Side_2
Well of course I can swim, if the
occasion calls for it.

Person_7
Trust me.

Person_7
The occasion calls for it.

Side_4
Americans.

Side_4
I say! Good show!

Side_4
And did I panic?

Side_4
I think not.

Person_8
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I
got all the horses!

Person_7
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on
the wrong side of the river!

Side_4
I can't believe the price of these
fleabags.

Person_7
We coulda had 'em for free, all we
had to do was give 'em your sister.

Side_4
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

Person_7
Awfully.

Person_7
Then again...

Side_4
Never did like camels. Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.
Disgusting.

Person_7
Yeah, disgusting.

Side_2
Well I think they're cute.

Side_4
And you snore!

Side_5
I do not snore!

Side_4
All night you snored!

Side_5
I have never snored!

Person_7
We're almost there.

Side_2
Are you sure?

Person_7
Pretty sure.

Side_4
What in bloody hell is this?

Side_5
Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

Person_8
Good morning, my friend!

Side_8
Well, what the hell we doin'?

Person_8
Patience, my good sahib, patience.

Side_9
First one to the city, O'Connell!
Five hundred! Cash bucks!

Person_7
Get ready.

Side_2
For what?

Person_7
We're about to be shown the way.

Side_4
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't
we be going?

Side_2
After all, you rode us night and day
to win that bet.

Person_8
Fools.

Person_7
Evelyn! Slow down!

Person_7
Never mind.

Person_7
You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

Side_8
Where'd all these camels come from?

Person_8
They belong to the dead. They will
wait years for their masters to return
before leaving.

Side_4
That thing gives me the creeps.

Person_7
Be nice. That thing saved my life.

Side_2
That "thing" gets me excited.

Person_7
The things that get you excited.

Side_2
According to Bembridge Scholars,
inside the statue of Anubis was a
secret compartment, perhaps containing
The Book Of The Living.

Person_7
What are those mirrors for?

Side_2
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

Side_2
Do you realize, we are standing inside
a room that no one has entered in
over four thousand years.

Side_5
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

Person_7
You're welcome to my share of the
spider webs.

Side_4
And it stinks to high heaven in here.

Side_2
Cretins.

Side_11
RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's
chamber.

Person_7
That is a neat trick.

Side_2
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

Person_7
Preparation for what?

Side_2
For entering the afterlife.

Side_4
Mummies, my good son, this is where
they made the mummies.

Side_9
Ya scared the bejeezus out of us,
O'Connell.

Person_7
Likewise.

Side_8
This here is our statue,... friend.

Person_7
Don't see your name on it,... pal.

Person_8
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are
no-so-good.

Person_7
I've had worse.

Side_4
Yes, me too.

Side_2
Let's be nice, children, if we're
going to play together, we must learn
to share.

Side_2
According to my calculations, we
should be right under the statue.
We'll come up right between his legs.
Oh my.

Side_4
And when those dirty Yanks go to
sleep --
No offense.

Person_7
None taken.

Side_4
We'll sneak up and steal that book
right out from under them.

Person_7
And you're sure you can find the
secret compartment?

Side_2
Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't
already found it.

Side_4
I say, what's our smelly little friend
got himself up to?

Side_12
Seti was no fool.

Side_9
Yeah, sure...

Side_9
We'll let him open it.

Person_7
Lemme get this straight, they stuck
a sharp, red hot poker up your nose,
cut your brain into small pieces,
then ripped it all out through your
nostrils?

Side_4
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

Side_2
It's called mummification. You're
dead when they do this

Side_4
Still...

Person_7
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

Side_2
You two are worse than a couple of
schoolboys.

Side_13
THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

Side_2
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks
like a sarcophagus.

Person_7
Why would they bury somebody in the
ceiling?

Side_2
They didn't, they buried him at the
foot of Anubis. He was either someone
of great importance. Or he did
something very naughty.

Side_4
Well?... Who is it?

Side_2
'He that shall not be named.'

Person_7
There's some sort of lock here. You
say these thing's are made of granite
with a steel interior?

Side_2
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

Side_4
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting
out.

Person_7
No kiddin', without a key, it'll
take us a month to crack this thing,

Side_2
A key! That's it! That's what he was
talking about.

Person_7
Who was talking about what?

Side_2
The man on the barge. The one with
the hook, he was looking for a key.

Side_4
Hey that's mine!

Side_2
What do you suppose killed him?

Side_4
Did you ever see him eat?

Person_7
Seems the Americans had a little
misadventure of their own today,
three of their diggers were killed.

Side_2
How?

Person_7
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.
Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

Side_4
Maybe this place really is cursed.

Side_2
You two!

Person_7
You don't believe in curses, huh?

Side_2
No. I believe if I can see it and I
can touch it, then it's real. That's
what I believe.

Person_7
I believe in being prepared.

Side_4
Seagrams!

Side_4
Well, he may have been a stinky
fellow,... but he had good taste.

Person_7
Stay here!

Side_4
Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man
just say -- !

Person_7
Goin' somewhere?

Person_8
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I
wanted to be with my friend!

Person_7
C'mon, friend.

Person_8
Why do you like to fight so much?

Person_7
'Cause I look good doin, it.

Side_4
Let 'em have it, boys!

Side_4
I say, bloody good show.

Person_7
You alright?

Side_2
Yes,... fine,... thank you.

Side_8
See! That proves it! Old Seti's
fortune's gotta be under this sand!

Side_9
For them to protect it like this,
you just know there's got to be
treasure down there.

Person_7
These men are a desert people. They
value water, not gold.

Side_2
Where's Jonathan?

Side_2
Unlike my brother, sir, I know when
to say no.

Person_7
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I
don't get. You're a whole new brew.

Side_2
I know, you're wondering, what's a
place like me doing in a girl like
this?

Person_7
Something like that.

Side_2
Egypt is in my blood. My father was
a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so
much that he married an Egyptian. My
mother! Who was quite an adventurer
herself

Person_7
Okay, I get your father, I get your
mother and I get your brother, but
what are you doing here?

Side_2
I may not be an explorer, or an
adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or
a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But
I'm proud of what I am.

Person_7
And what is that?

Side_2
...I am a librarian!

Side_2
I'm going to kiss you, Mister
O'Connell.

Person_7
No you're not.

Side_2
I'm not?

Person_7
Not unless you call me Rick.

Side_2
Why would I do that?

Person_7
Because that's my name.

Side_2
I can't believe I allowed the two of
you to get me drunk.

Side_4
Don't blame me, I don't even remember
being there.

Side_2
Well neither do I, thank you.

Person_7
You don't?

Side_2
No... Why?... Should I?

Person_7
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the
best time you ever had.

Side_12
There is a curse upon this chest.

Side_8
Curse my ass.

Side_9
Yeah, who cares.

Side_12
In these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times, is
as strong today, as it was then.

Side_9
Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

Side_12
"Death will come on swift wings to
whomever opens this chest".

Side_12
It says, there is one, the undead,
who if brought back to life, is bound
by sacred law to consummate this
curse.

Side_9
Yeah, well, let's just make sure we
don't bring anybody back from the
dead then, huh?

Side_12
He will kill all who open this
chest,... and assimilate their organs
and fluids.

Side_8
Assimilate their organs and fluids?
Ya mean eat 'em?

Side_12
And in so doing he will regenerate.
And no longer be the undead, but a
plague upon this earth.

Side_9
Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

Side_2
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this
ever since I was a little girl.

Person_7
You dream about dead guys?

Side_2
Look, all the sacred spells have
been chiseled off. The hieratics and
hieroglyphs that protect the deceased
on his journey into the afterlife,
they've been removed. This man was
cursed,... doomed.

Person_7
Tough break.

Side_4
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see
who's inside, shall we?

Person_8
The curse,... beware the curse!

Side_8
Stupid superstitious bastard.

Person_7
Is he supposed to look like that?

Side_2
No. I've never seen a mummy look
like this. He's, he's still...

Side_4
Juicy?

Side_2
Yes. He's more than four thousand
years old and still decomposing.

Person_7
And look at this.

Side_2
Oh my god, he was buried alive.

Side_2
And he left a message.

Side_2
It says: 'Death is only the
beginning.'

Person_7
Where's my gun?

Side_4
What are you going to do? Shoot him?

Person_7
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

Side_12
I have heard told of this book, but
I never truly believed it existed.
This, good gentlemen, is a most
priceless treasure.

Side_9
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass
spittoon!

Side_8
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta
pure gold!

Side_4
What is this stuff? It smells like
our late friend, the Warden.

Side_4
You did not!?... We're not!?

Person_7
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and
taste worse, but that's the best the
desert has to offer.

Side_9
Say O'Connell, whadaya think these
honey's'll fetch back home?

Side_10
We hear you gentlemen found yerselves
a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

Side_8
Ya know if ya dry him out, you can
sell him for firewood.

Side_2
Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them
inside our friend's coffin. They can
stay alive for years living off the
flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

Side_2
Famished.

Person_7
Are you saying somebody threw these
things in with our guy, and they
slowly ate him alive?

Side_2
Very slowly.

Side_4
He certainly was not a popular fellow
when they planted him.

Person_7
Must of got a little too frisky with
the Pharaoh's daughter.

Side_2
According to my readings, our friend
suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of
all ancient Egyptian curses, one
reserved for only the most evil
blasphemers. In all of my research,
I've never read of this curse actually
having been performed.

Person_7
That bad huh?

Side_2
Yes, they never used it because they
feared it so. It's written, that if
a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever
arise, he would bring with him the
ten plagues of Egypt.

Person_7
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten
plagues.

Person_8
Like what that Moses guy did to that
Pharaoh guy?

Side_2
That's one way of putting it.

Side_4
Let's see, there was frogs, flies,
locusts...

Side_10
Hail and fire.

Side_9
The sun turning black.

Side_8
Water turning to blood.

Side_4
And my personal favorite: people
covered in boils and sores.

Side_2
Fried gizzard anyone?

Person_7
You sure you outta be playin, around
with that?

Side_2
It's just a book, no harm ever came
from a book.

Side_2
Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

Side_12
What have we done?

Side_4
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!
Billions of grasshoppers!

Person_7
That's one of the plagues, right?
The grasshopper plague!

Side_2
This is not a plague. It's
generational. Every so many years
the locusts of Egypt have a population
explosion and they all take flight.

Person_7
Okay,... and what about frogs?

Side_10
Daniels! Henderson!

Side_10
Daniels?... is that you?

Side_10
Henderson?

Side_2
Oh thank goodness, you're one of the
Americans, aren't you?

Person_6
Anck-su-namun?

Person_7
Damn-it! Must be a trap door around
here or somethin'.

Side_2
Help me,... please,... help me.

Person_6
Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

Person_7
Would you quit playin, around! Let's
get outta here already!

Person_7
Ahhhhhhhh!!

Side_14
I told you to leave or die, you
refused, and now you may have killed
us all. For you have unleashed the
creature that we have feared for
more than four thousand years.

Person_7
Relax, I got him.

Side_14
No mortal weapons can kill this
creature. He is not of this world.

Person_7
Are we talkin, about the same
creature? The walking corpse? Really
big mouth? Really bad breath?

Person_8
May the good Lord protect and watch
over me as a shepherd watches over
his flock. And may Satan in all his
forms be vanquished forever.

Person_6
The language of the slaves.

Person_6
I may have use for you. And the
rewards will be great.

Person_6
Where are the other sacred jars?

Side_8
You bastards!

Side_9
What did you do to him!?

Side_14
We saved him! Saved him before the
creature could finish his work. Now
leave, all of you, quickly, before
he finishes you all.

Side_4
You're not going to kill us?

Side_14
We must now hunt him down, and try
and find a way to kill him, before
he consumes the earth. Allah be with
us.

Person_7
I told ya, I already got him!

Side_14
Know this, the creature will be coming
for you. He must consummate the curse.
And until he does, he will never
eat, he will never sleep, and he
will never stop.

Person_7
I thought you didn't believe in this
stuff!?

Side_2
Having an encounter with a four
thousand year old walking-talking
corpse tends to convert one.

Person_7
Forget it, we're out the door down
the hall and gone.

Side_2
No, we are not.

Person_7
Oh yes we are.

Side_2
No we are not. We woke him up, and
we must try and stop him.

Person_7
We?! What we?! You didn't read that
book. I told you not to play around
with that thing.

Side_2
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the
book, I woke him up and I intend to
stop him.

Person_7
How!? You heard the man, no mortal
weapons can kill this guy.

Side_2
Then we'll have to find some immortal
ones.

Person_7
There goes that belief again. Not
me, I am outta here!

Side_2
According to that Book, once this
creature has been reborn, his curse
will spread, and as he grows in
strength, so will his curse grow,
infecting the people until the whole
of the earth is destroyed.

Person_7
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

Side_2
It's everybody's problem!

Person_7
Look lady, I appreciate you saving
my life and all, but when I signed
on, I agreed to take you out there
and bring you back, and I did, now
were even, end of job, end of story,
contract terminated.

Side_2
That's what I am to you? A contract?

Person_7
You can either tag along with me, or
you can stay here and play around
with Mister Maggot.

Side_2
I'm staying.

Person_7
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did
you slink off to?

Person_8
You left me! You left me in the desert
to rot.

Person_7
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
So who's this guy?

Person_8
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest
of Osiris.

Person_7
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

Person_8
The Prince does not like to be touched
by other humans. A Silly eastern
superstition, I'm afraid.

Person_7
Yeah, well, we all got our little
problems today don't we?

Person_8
He has come to help Mister Burns.
Somehow I feel responsible.

Person_7
Don't gimme that, you never had any
scruples.

Person_8
Do you know where I can steal some?

Person_7
See ya around, Padre.

Side_15
I'm the last of the Royal Force still
stationed here, you know? All the
other laddies died in the air and
were buried in the sand.

Side_15
Ever since the end of the Great War,
there hasn't been a single challenge
worthy of a man like me.

Person_7
I've heard it before, Winston.

Side_15
I just wish I would've chucked it
with the other laddies, gone down in
a flame of glory, instead of sitting
around here, rotting from boredom
and booze!

Side_10
The drawer there, spectacles.
As you see, I won't be needing them.

Person_8
Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks
you for your spectacles, -- and for
your eyes,... and for your tongue.

Person_8
But I am afraid more is needed, the
Prince says he must finish the job,
consummate the curse which you and
your friends have brought down upon
yourselves.

Side_9
Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,...
like...

Person_7
Blood.

Side_4
"And the rivers and waters of Egypt
went red and were as blood."

Person_7
He's here.

Side_4
Who's here!?

Person_7
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

Person_7
Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

Person_7
We got problems.

Person_7
He's here! I saw him! That thing is
here!

Side_2
The creature!? Are you sure!?

Person_7
Pretty sure!

Person_7
We are in serious trouble.

Person_7
Back off, creep.

Person_6
You saved me from the undead. For
this, I shall make you immortal.

Side_9
The curse. The curse.

Side_2
There's only one person I know who
can possibly give us some answers.

Side_3
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

Side_2
What is he doing here?

Side_3
Do you truly wish to know? Or would
you prefer to just shoot us?

Person_7
I just saw my fist vanish into some
guy's head.

Person_7
I'm willin, to go on a little faith,
here.

Side_3
You will not believe it.

Person_7
Try me.

Side_3
We are part of an ancient secret
society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and
we have a sacred mission, passed
down through thirty-nine generations.
For over four thousand years we have
guarded The City Of The Dead. we are
sworn at manhood to do any and all
in our power to stop the High Priest
Imhotep from being reborn into this
world.

Side_14
And because of you, we have failed.

Side_2
And you think this justifies killing
innocent people!?

Side_3
To have stopped this creature? Yes!

Person_7
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's
afraid of cats, what's that about?

Side_3
According to the ancients, cat's are
the guardians at the gates of the
underworld. Imhotep will fear them
until he is fully regenerated, and
then he will fear nothing.

Side_8
Right! And ya know how he gets fully
regenerated?! By killing everybody
who opened that chest and sucking us
dry! That's how!

Side_3
Yes, the creature must first try and
regenerate, and then he will attempt
to resurrect the one he has loved
for more than four thousand years.

Side_2
Anck-su-namun.

Side_2
In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
su-namun. And then in Mister Burns'
quarters he tried to kiss me.

Side_3
It is because it was you who read
from the Book. He has chosen you to
be the human sacrifice needed to
regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

Side_4
This is not good. Not good at all.

Side_14
Tonight is the full moon. The moon
of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

Side_4
"...and he stretched forth his hands
towards the heavens, and there was
darkness throughout the land of
Egypt."

Side_2
We must stop him from regenerating.

Side_2
Who opened that chest?

Side_9
Well, there was me and Daniels here
and then poor Burns of course, oh
yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

Person_7
What about my buddy, Beni?

Side_8
Naw, he scrammed outta there,

Side_2
We must find the Egyptologist and
bring him back here to the safety of
the fort, before the creature can
get to him.

Person_7
Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you
two come with me.

Side_9
The hell with that! I'm not goin'
nowhere! We're safe here.

Side_8
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for
nothin'.

Side_2
Who put you in charge? You can't
just leave me behind like some old
suitcase. I'm the one responsible
for this mess and I intend to be the
one to clean it up.

Person_7
Keep an eye on her. If you leave her
door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon,
Jonathan.

Side_4
Me?

Person_7
Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

Person_7
Where's your new friend?

Person_8
What friend? You're my only friend.

Person_7
Then you got no excuse for living.
What the hell you doin, being buddies
with this creep, Beni? What's in it
for you?

Person_8
It is better to be the right hand of
the Devil,... than in his path. As
long as I serve him, I am immune.

Person_7
Immune from what?

Person_8
You shall see.

Person_7
What are you looking for? Lie, and
I'll slit your throat.

Person_8
The book! The black book they found
at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back.
Said to me it would be worth it's
weight in diamonds.

Person_7
What does he want the book for?

Person_8
Something about bringing his dead
girly-friend back to life. He needs
the book...
And your sister.

Side_4
That looked rather painful.

Person_7
Ya know, ever since I met you, my
luck has been for crap.

Side_4
Yes, I know, I do that to people.

Person_7
Damn-it! That's two down and only
two to go.

Side_4
And then he'll be coming after Evy.

Side_16
Ten o'clock! All is well!

Side_8
The hell with this. I'm goin,
downstairs to get me a drink. You
want somethin'?

Side_9
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a
shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

Person_7
Get your hands off my girl, pal.

Person_7
Nice lips.

Person_7
I figured you might be here, so I
brought a friend.

Side_2
You called me your girl?

Person_7
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um,
you know, figure a speech.

Side_2
I think you were jealous

Person_7
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see
that guy's face?

Side_8
Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do
somethin'! we gotta do somethin,
NOW! Before it's too late!

Side_2
Last month I came across an
inscription that mentioned The Book
Of The Dead.

Side_8
That book we found at Hamunaptra?

Side_2
Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked
about bringing people back from the
dead. A notion I was unwilling to
believe.

Person_7
Believe it, sister. That's what
brought our buddy back to life.

Side_4
And now he's going to use it to bring
his girlfriend back

Side_14
And if he succeeds, the two of them
together will bring about the
apocalypse.

Side_17
The plagues we have seen so far, are
merely Imhotep flexing his muscles.
Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's
resurrection will he be truly
invincible.

Side_2
I'm thinking that if the black Book
Of The Dead can bring people back to
life --

Side_3
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of
The Living can return them to the
underworld.

Side_2
Exactly --

Person_7
So your sayin', if we find the book
made outta gold --

Side_3
-- And read the sacred incantations
contained inside it.

Person_7
You think it'll send this guy back
to hell?

Side_3
Correct, And that's when --

Side_14
It has begun. The beginning of the
end.

Side_2
Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

Side_2
Got it!

Person_7
Got what?

Side_2
Since the black Book of The Dead was
found inside the statue of Anubis,
then according to this, the golden
Book of The Living should be inside...

Person_7
What?

Side_4
What?

Side_2
The golden Book Of The Living, is
inside the statue of Horus.

Side_3
Which would be located not far to
the east of the Anubis statue.

Person_7
Don't tell me we gotta go back out
there?

Side_3
If we want to kill the creature,
yes.

Side_4
Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

Person_8
Imhotep! IMHOTEP!

Person_7
You're gonna get yours, pal!

Person_7
C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

Side_2
He's gorgeous.

Side_17
He has consummated the curse, now
all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun
from the dead, then it will be the
end of us, and the beginning for
them.

Person_6
Koontash dai na.

Person_8
Take his hand and he will spare the
others.

Side_2
Any bright ideas?

Person_7
Sorry, fresh out.

Person_7
Don't do it, Evelyn.

Side_2
I have no choice.

Person_6
Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

Person_8
Come with me my princess. It is time
to make you mine, forever.

Side_2
All eternity, idiot.

Side_2
You better think of something, because
if he turns me into a mummy, you're
the first one I'm coming after.

Person_7
Got guts, lady.

Side_2
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep
them.

Side_4
Hey that's mine -- !

Person_7
Evelyn!

Side_14
Be calm. There is still time. We can
stop him yet.

Person_6
Pared oos.

Person_8
Kill them.

Side_3
Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

Person_7
We gotta get her back.

Side_4
I'm with you, old man. No one touches
my sister like that and gets away
with it.

Person_7
You know where he's taking her?

Side_14
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the
ritual.

Side_4
And what ritual would that be?

Side_14
The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
su-namun back to life.

Side_4
And how does one do that?

Side_14
By reading the Book Of The Dead.

Side_4
Oh yes, of course.

Side_14
And then killing your sister.

Side_4
Excuse me?

Side_14
Imhotep is now able to cross the
desert with great haste.

Side_4
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't
quite clear on that last part.

Side_14
If he arrives before us, it will be
too late.

Side_4
Did you say 'kill' my sister?

Person_7
I know how to beat him to it.

Side_15
So what's your little problem got to
do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

Person_7
Not a god-damned thing.

Side_15
Is it dangerous?

Person_7
You probably won't live through it.

Side_15
By Jove, do you really think so?

Side_4
Everybody else we've bumped into has
died, why not you?

Side_15
So what's the challenge then?

Person_7
To save the damsel in distress, kill
the bad guy and steal his treasure.

Side_15
Winston Havlock at your service,
sir!

Side_2
What just happened?

Person_8
All I remember is him turning into a
blast of sand,... and then I remember
nothing.

Side_15
Hang on, men!

Side_15
We're going down!

Side_15
Here I come, laddies!

Side_2
Stop it! You'll kill them!

Side_4
Excuse me... A little help would be
useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH

Person_7
Okay, now what the hell does this
Horus guy look like?

Side_4
He's a big fellow with pointy ears
and a face like a falcon.

Person_7
Got it.

Person_8
Keep moving.

Side_2
You know, nasty little fellows such
as yourself, always get their
comeuppance.

Person_8
Yeah?

Side_2
Oh yes, always.

Side_4
I say, look at that.

Side_4
Say, gents! You should come have a
look at this.

Person_7
From now on, don't touch anything.
Not a damn thing. Keep your hands
off the furniture, got it?

Person_8
Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

Side_2
Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but
that it's already taken.

Person_8
He wants your heart and your brain,
your liver, your kidneys...

Person_8
...and how do you say? Those slimy
things, in your stomach?

Side_2
Intestines.

Person_8
Yeah! Them.

Side_2
You only want me for my organs?!

Person_7
Who the hell are these guys?

Side_14
Priests. Imhotep's priests.

Person_7
I never killed a priest before.

Side_14
They are evil, cursed, they matter
not.

Person_7
Well, okay then.

Person_7
Oh come on, gimme a break here.

Person_6
(ancient Egyptian --
subtitled)
Kill them! Kill them all! And bring
me the Book Of The Living!

Side_14
My turn.

Person_7
This whole place is comin, alive!

Side_14
I'm out.

Side_4
There he is!

Side_4
Hello Horus old boy.

Side_14
Allow me.

Person_7
These guys just don't quit.

Side_14
Keep digging!

Side_18
THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in
the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

Side_14
Save the girl! Kill the creature!

Person_7
That's the last one, we better get
lucky.

Person_6
With your death, my love and I will
be invincible!

Side_4
I found it, Evy! I found it

Side_2
Shut-up and get me off of here!

Side_2
Open the book, Jonathan! Open the
book! That's the only way to kill
him!

Side_4
I can't open it! It's locked or
something!

Side_4
We need the key!

Side_4
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

Side_2
Read the inscription on the cover!

Side_4
Keetash-something, naraba-something.

Side_4
Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

Side_4
Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

Side_4
Oh boy.

Person_7
This just keeps gettin, better and
better.

Person_7
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

Side_4
You have got to be joking?

Side_2
Finish the inscription, idiot!

Side_4
Oh.

Side_4
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now
what is this last symbol here?

Side_2
What's it look like!?

Side_4
It's an Anck symbol, with two little
squiggly lines above it, and a bird,
a stork! on either side.

Side_2
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

Side_4
Yes,... I see.

Side_4
Hootash im Ahmenophus!

Person_7
Okay pal, let's see how tough you
are without your right arm.

Person_7
Alright,... so he's left handed.

Side_4
I got it!

Side_2
Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos!

Side_2
Death is only the beginning.

Person_7
C'mon!

Person_8
Go away.

Side_4
Well,... I guess we go home empty
handed.

Person_7
Wouldn't say that.

Person_1
There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
comedians.

Person_2
You complain about the crowd like all
the time.

Person_1
Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.

Person_2
So like ninety percent of the time,
they're really bad?

Person_1
Will you just watch and give me notes
tonight? If we both give each other
notes, I think it would be helpful.

Person_2
Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
into the bit.

Person_1
Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
it's hard on the end.

Person_3
That was truly horrible.

Person_2
Hey, that was great.

Person_3
No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
thought I was gonna puke.

Person_1
Who?

Person_3
Bob Dalavan.

Person_1
Who's Bob Dalaban?

Person_4
Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.

Person_5
No one's on stage?

Person_3
No!

Person_2
He might have been doing cocaine.

Person_4
Was he doing cocaine recreationally?

Person_3
A true cokehead.

Person_1
Confidence. Poise. Smile.

Person_2
He's like if a serial killer fucked an
inspirational speaker.

Person_4
He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
sucks.

Person_1
Just bought a laser printer. Printed
out like six lasers so far.

Person_2
Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
tonight. Could I do ten?

Person_5
No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
you get five minutes. You know the
deal.

Person_2
C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.

Person_5
No.

Person_2
What are you gonna do in there?

Person_5
I'm making up next week's schedule.

Person_2
Okay. Cool.

Person_4
I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
trying to mansplain to her that, you
know, we are on one little rock orbiting
a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
You are cosmically over reacting to this.
Honestly you are being super selfish.
You're right, but you're selfish.

Person_2
Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
reports so I looked up what cheese is and
cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
the heroin, it's very powerful. You
already have heroin.

Person_2
Is Pakistan in the house?!

Person_2
You're not from Pakistan. I would have
noticed you.

Person_1
He just gave you Montreal? Like you
don't have to showcase or audition or
anything?

Person_4
It was too easy. Like I wanted to
struggle. I wanted a story to be able
to tell on talk shows and instead,
like, you guys don't know how hard it
is not to struggle. It's a struggle
succeeding effortlessly.

Person_3
Did he say anything about me?

Person_4
Sure.

Person_1
What about me?

Person_4
Both of you. He said, those guys
performed...

Person_3
I truly hate you, actually.

Person_1
We all hate you.

Person_2
Hi.

Person_6
Hi.

Person_2
Um, my name is Kumail.

Person_6
Yeah. We know.

Person_7
We saw you perform.

Person_2
Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
the way, I have to tell you that when
you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
so rude.

Person_6
I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
you. It was supportive.

Person_2
Okay, that's a common misconception.
Yelling anything at a comedian is
considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
have to be negative.

Person_6
So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
bed," that would be a heckle?

Person_2
Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

Person_7
Wow. Goodbye!

Person_6
Don't go! You scared my friend off now.

Person_2
What's your name?

Person_6
Emily.

Person_2
I want to show you something, Emily.
This is your name in Urdu.

Person_6
Whoa. Does this move work?

Person_2
I've had some minor success with it.

Person_6
Bullshit.

Person_2
So you came to a comedy show with your
friends?

Person_6
Yeah, we're all grad students at U of

Person_2
What are you studying at grad school?

Person_6
I study psychology. I'm going to be a
therapist.

Person_2
Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
ask people, "how did that make you
feel?"

Person_6
Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
work with a group of guys convicted of
domestic violence.

Person_2
Jesus.

Person_6
Cheers to that.

Person_2
Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
you becoming a therapist.

Person_6
Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
start there and then we'll go to the
rest of it.

Person_2
So my roommate Chris is probably on the
couch. He's going to try and start a
conversation. So no matter what- do not
engage. Okay? Let's go.

Person_1
Hi!

Person_1
Good for him.

Person_2
Do you want to watch a movie?

Person_6
Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
Or...

Person_2
Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
what, go for that area. I cleaned that
earlier this year.

Person_6
Should I take my shoes off or is this a
shoes on bed?

Person_2
No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
rules.

Person_6
Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
mattress.

Person_2
Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
inflatable mattress?

Person_6
I did think it might be an actual
mattress.

Person_2
Well air mattresses are actual
mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
air based comfort items.

Person_2
Night of The Living Dead?

Person_6
Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.

Person_2
Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
And the good guys, um...

Person_1
Text Lauren. You up girl?

Person_8
What do you want to say to Warren?

Person_1
Ah, no. Fuck.

Person_8
What do you want to say to-

Person_1
You up? Period. Send.

Person_8
That may be beyond my abilities at the
moment.

Person_1
Fuck.

Person_6
What are these scars?

Person_2
Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.

Person_6
I thought only old people had those.

Person_2
Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
fighting some battles you guys have
already won.

Person_6
What were you like in high school? Were
you like, super funny? Were you really
smart?

Person_2
I was very shy. They called me
chashmullee.

Person_6
What is that?

Person_2
It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
show you a picture.

Person_6
Of you in high school? Oh my god!

Person_2
Boom.

Person_6
No.

Person_2
And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
now.

Person_6
What inspired this hair cut?

Person_2
Hugh Grant.

Person_6
Oh no. And you're so serious.

Person_2
I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
he said he doesn't smile because it
makes his face look fat. So I didn't
smile in pictures for many years. What
were you like in high school? Were you
voted... Most Sexy?

Person_6
No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."

Person_2
That's good.

Person_6
No. It's really not good. I had acne,
and I was a Goth and I had this
terrible perm. The kids called me
Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
I do know why, it's because they
thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
think I'm done with this subject. In
fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

Person_2
Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.

Person_6
No. No. I'm really not that kind of
girl. I only have sex once on a first
date. Plus a hand job.

Person_2
Well I haven't had that yet!

Person_6
You don't get that because you made fun
of me.

Person_2
What is happening right now? What are you
doing?

Person_6
I'm changing under this blanket.

Person_2
I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
were just having sex?

Person_6
Yeah, but you were in the throes of
passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
call an Uber and go home.

Person_2
Your driver will be ready as soon as he
puts on his pants.

Person_6
Were you available for rides while we
were fucking?

Person_2
Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
times.

Person_2
So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
sometime and we can grab a drink?

Person_6
I'm not really - I know this sounds
like a line - but I'm not really dating
right now. I have a lot of school and
work and just a lot on my plate.

Person_2
That's perfect because I'm not really
dating right now either. I actually
have a pretty strict two-day rule where
I can't see someone more than two days
in a row. So since we hung out for two
days, if I were to see you again, which
I won't because you're not dating, I'm
not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
you until Monday.

Person_6
We haven't hung out for two days. We've
hung out for about five hours. Just to
like, be totally clear.

Person_2
Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
days.

Person_6
You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
really takes you off the table.

Person_2
That works out, because I am a hard
core time nerd.

Person_6
Yeah, I can tell.

Person_2
I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
stuff.

Person_6
So wait, just to establish, what did we
just decide?

Person_2
We decided we aren't ever going to see
each other again.

Person_6
Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.

Person_2
I don't want to touch your jeans.

Person_9
They're like sweatpants. You should be
stylish like your father. It's not very
difficult. Just observe me.

Side_1
Get some Daddy Style.

Side_2
Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
like Naveed's, just a small one.

Person_9
Maybe like mine, small and stylish.

Side_2
Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
you don't enroll for LSAT now?

Person_2
Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
I like that you bring it up as though
you've never brought it up before.

Side_1
How's the stand-up coming Bhai?

Person_2
It's going fine.

Side_2
Since when are you someone to stand-up?
You know who I think should stand up is
Malala. She has something to say.

Side_1
Ma-la-la.

Person_2
She does open mics and she crushes. Lot
of ethnic material, which I think is a
crutch, and that one story gets a lot of
play, but -

Side_3
You should be on that show Saturday Night
Live!

Person_2
That's a great idea. I should e-mail
them, I don't know why I hadn't thought
of that.

Person_9
You know, I hacked into your Cousin
Rehan's Facebook account-

Person_2
You hacked into it?

Person_9
Yeah, they were not accepting my friend
request so I had to hack into it and I
discovered he and that white woman he is
living with are having a baby -

Person_2
They're married.

Person_9
Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into
Tumblr and I discovered that they named
him Dav. Can you imagine?

Person_2
Dave. It's probably Dave.

Side_4
Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave.

Side_2
Very, very, very sad. No one is going to
visit that baby. That baby, mark my
words, will grow up without a family.

Side_3
It's like he's dead. Or worse.

Side_2
It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we
can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is
downstairs.

Side_1
Hurry up yaar. Ice cream.

Person_9
My mother used to make best kulfi. Your
grandmother.

Person_2
I think ice cream is better than kulfi.

Person_9
No, no-

Side_2
Oh. I wonder who that could be?

Person_2
I'm guessing it's a young, single
Pakistani woman who just happened to be
driving by our house, which is in a cul-
de-sac and I'm also guessing that the
phrase "dropped in" will be said in the
next ten seconds.

Person_9/NAVEED/FATIMA
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven -

Side_2
Everyone. This is Zubeida. She just
dropped in.

Side_6
Salaam.

Side_4
Wa alaikum salaam.

Side_2
Please, sit.

Side_6
Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X-
Files. Because that's your favorite
show, huh?

Person_2
Thank you so much.

Side_6
The truth is out there!

Person_2
It's from the show. Thank you.

Side_2
I hope you come back.

Side_2
Kumi, there's not going to be a magic
spark, okay? You have to work at it. You
have to stay open.

Person_2
Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were
better at it, you know?

Person_2
I mean you've had so much practice and
you're still not that good at it!

Side_2
Ha. Ha. Ha.

Person_2
You brought your A-game with Naveed, but
then with me, you're kind of just phoning
it in a little bit.

Side_7
Again with the comedy, the comedy. All
the time with the comedy. Be serious!

Person_2
I am serious! That's why I want to help
you get better!

Person_6
So, are you ever going to let me sit in
the front seat?

Person_2
No, I'm a professional. And you're paying
for this ride.

Person_6
I don't want to pay for this ride! It's
surging right now.

Person_2
Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in
the number.

Person_2
Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a
string of failures. So, it turns to its
most bankable star, Vincent Price.

Person_6
Is this your compatibility test? Like,
the way people are with Vonnegut or The
Big Lebowski?

Person_2
No! Just watch the movie. And take it
seriously.

Person_6
I'm going to love it. I love it when men
test me on my taste.

Person_2
I just want to share this movie with you,
so I don't know why you're reading into-

Person_6
How many women have you shown this movie
to?

Person_2
Zero.

Person_6
How many women have you shown a B Horror
movie to on like, a third date.

Person_2
This is not a B horror movie.

Person_2
Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes
cause when the menu comes up, there's
some spoilers in the menu.

Person_6
I'm ready, I'm ready!

Person_2
Ok, I'll hit play.

Person_2
Watch!

Person_6
I'm watching!

Person_2
Shhhhhh! Watch this part.

Person_6
Stop watching me!

Person_2
No! Are you tired? We can watch it later.

Person_6
I just have that weird yawning thing that
happens, when you're watching a really
boring film.

Person_2
It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in.
The plot kicks in really soon.

Person_6
That was fun. Thanks for the ride home,
but we gotta stop doing this.

Person_2
Yeah.

Person_6
I know I've said that before, but I
really do mean it. I can't be doing this
right now.

Person_2
I know. Totally. One hundred percent. I
agree with you.

Person_6
So don't call me again.

Person_2
I won't. I promise.

Person_6
Good luck on all your future endeavors.

Person_2
Oh yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an
awkward hug before we part forever?

Person_6
Ok.

Person_2
Ok.

Person_6
Goodbye.

Person_2
Goodbye.

Person_6
You just promised never to call me
again.

Person_2
It's really cold out here. It's so
cold.

Person_6
You make a pretty good point.

Person_6
It's a lot warmer in here.

Person_2
It is warmer in here.

Person_6
You know, it's really nice upstairs.

Person_2
Is it?

Person_4
Emily, has Kumail told you that in
addition to being an Uber driver he
also has a one-man show?

Person_6
No, he did not tell me that.   Do you
really?

Person_2
It's really nothing. It's just
something I'm fiddling around with.

Person_6
How is a one man show different from
stand-up?

Person_2
It's really not.

Person_3
There's lots of wigs and costume
changes.

Person_4
There's a lot of acting in it.

Person_3
And then like at the end of it, you've
got this very awkward conversation where
you go, "I really liked it."

Person_2
But I thought you really liked it!

Person_3
I really liked it.

Person_6
I can't wait to see the show.

Person_2
You will never see the show...

Person_4
You have to see the show.

Person_3
You have to see it.

Person_2
It's not ready.

Person_4
You will love the acting.

Person_2
They're fucking with you.   It's not
really like that.

Person_6
Are they fucking with me or you? It
seems like they're fucking with you.

Person_2
I'm twelve years old. This...this is
home. Feels like I never left. Do you
smell that? That's my mom cooking the
Murgh Roghen Joash.

Person_4
Fuck.

Person_2
Do you hear that? That's my father
watching cricket on the telly. Do you
feel that? That's the weight of
Pakistan's history.

Person_2
Pakistan was formed when it separated
from its biggest rival, India, on
August 14th 1947.

Person_2
Six runs!

Person_2
Silly Mid On, Short Mid Wicket,
Midwicket, Deep Mid Wicket, Mid On, Long
On, Long Off...

Person_7
I have to leave as soon as the show's
over. I can't stay.

Person_2
So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you
know you're getting a Yorker soon.

Person_2
So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports
are cotton and...

Side_8
Concrete.

Person_4
Kill me.

Person_2
Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas.
Except instead of the traditional
Christmas ham, we serve Mitthai, which
my khansama Chris will serve to you
right now. Khansama is Urdu for
servant.

Person_2
If you'd like to make it at home, the
main ingredients are condensed milk,
sugar, and love. At least, that was my
mom's recipe.

Person_4
Hey, you look like a children's toy from
Malaysia.

Person_2
Now all rise for the Pakistani national
anthem.

Person_6
Hey!

Person_2
Hey!    So? What did you think?

Person_6
Um, I thought it was great.

Person_2
Yeah?

Person_6
I never knew that Pakistan had the
world's largest irrigation system.

Person_2
Yeah. Something like 14 million
hectares are being irrigated. As soon
as I read that I was like "oh, that's
going in the show."

Person_4
Hey, that was... You were in the zone,
man. That was the best one we've seen.

Person_3
Yeah, that was so honest and good.

Person_4
And you know what I realized halfway
through? You're from Pakistan! Good to
see you Emily!

Person_6
Bye guys!

Person_4
Keep up the-

Person_2
They seem to like it.

Person_6
They're so nice.

Person_2
So, really what did you think?   You know,
it's a work in progress...

Person_6
I really liked it. I learned a lot.
About Pakistan, and cricket. All those
positions. But I just wish that I
learned more about you. Does that make
any sense?

Person_2
Yeah.

Person_2
Hey.

Person_6
Oh, hi!

Person_2
It's 3 AM.

Person_6
Is that diner around the corner open?

Person_2
It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old
lemon meringue pie?

Person_6
You're so funny! Actually, no, I
just...I really need to get a cup of
coffee.

Person_2
I can make you coffee.

Person_6
I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste.

Person_2
All right, I'll come with you.

Person_6
No, no! Why would you do that?

Person_2
It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna
let you go on your own.

Person_6
Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's
the most misogynist thing I've ever
heard.

Person_2
Why are you being so weird?

Person_6
Fuck you, I'm not being weird.

Person_2
You're being so weird.

Person_6
Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're
being so weird!

Person_2
How am I weird? I want to sleep while
it's sleep time.

Person_6
This is normal. Girls go to get coffee
in the middle of the night. Have you
never had a girlfriend before? This is
what it's like.

Person_2
Are you okay?

Person_6
Everything is not okay. Everything is
not okay.

Person_2
You can tell me anything, you know that
right? You can tell me anything.

Person_6
I have to take a shit, okay? I have to
take a huge fucking dookie. I can't
take a poo in your bathroom because you
don't have any matches and you don't
have any air freshener. What kind of
person doesn't have any matches or air
freshener in the bathroom? The walls
are so thin! And Chris is right out
there.

Person_6
Please stop laughing! Please, please.

Person_2
Okay, I have an idea.

Person_2
How are you?

Person_6
I do not want to talk about it.

Side_1
Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about
shifting weight and torque.

Side_1
Oh Christ!

Person_2
Oh.

Person_2
You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa.

Person_2
Hey he's pretty good. Just do what
he's doing.

Side_1
Mine.

Person_2
Come on.

Side_1
Mine, mine.

Person_2
These cookies are really good.

Side_1
They're biscuits! Listen to yourself.
You hardly sound Pakistani. "Cookies"?
You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
You're such a burger.

Person_2
I'm not a burger.

Side_1
Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger.

Person_2
I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually
a British term.

Side_1
Well thank you for that information
that no one gives a shit about and you
should listen to mom and grow a beard.

Person_2
It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's
all patchy.

Side_1
Try being a man and conditioning like I
do.

Person_2
What's the whole thing with Muslims
growing beards anyway? It's such an
arbitrary thing. Like who decided that?
Oh, we have to have beards.

Side_1
Yeah. There are a billion of us and you
are the only one with the truth. Is
that right? The sun is just shining
down on you right now. It's just
parting like "ahh".

Person_2
You know, I have to tell you something,
Bhai.

Side_1
Here we go. Yeah?

Person_2
I've been dating this girl.

Side_1
Acha.

Side_1
I thought you were going to say you were
involved in a hit and run or you got
caught forging some checks. But a WHITE
GIRL? Such a cliche.

Person_2
It's okay! We hate terrorists!

Side_1
Listen. I understand. You're in
America. You wanna mow a few lawns and
see what it's like. But eventually you
have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I
hung out with other girls. But then I
married Fatima. We hardly spoke two
words to each other the first few
months! But now, Kumi, she's like my
best friend. You have to break up with
her immediately.

Person_2
If I find someone who's as good for me
as Fatima is for you, Mom would
understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't
love me less?

Side_1
She would definitely love you less.
Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the
word when guys stop returning girls'
calls?

Person_2
Ghosting?

Side_1
Yes.
You have to end it now or Mom will
fucking ghost you.

Side_1
Now come on.

Person_6
I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd
say it's very fruit forward.

Person_2
Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice
that's gone bad. How do you know so
much about wine?

Person_6
Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my
first marriage and I drank a lot and
one way to cover drinking is to know a
lot about wine.

Person_2
I'm sorry wait, what did you say?

Person_6
That knowing a lot about wine sort of
covers for drinking a lot.

Person_2
No, the huge piece of information
you're trying to blow right past.

Person_6
Yeah. I was married.

Person_2
You were married?

Person_6
I was. I was married. Do you want to
talk about something else?

Person_2
Yeah, cause I don't really have any
questions other than...when did you get
married? When did you get divorced?
What's his name? How tall is he? Did
you love him? I guess I have a couple
of questions.

Person_6
Side_9
Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in
college. Everyone I knew was getting
married super young, so we did. And one
day I was at a restaurant and I saw
this couple making out and I thought "I
don't think about my husband like that,
but I guess that's okay" and then
another part of my brain was like "NO
feel like this is freaking you out.
Does this freak you out?

Person_2
It's not freaking me out.

Person_6
I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I
know it's only been a few months.

Person_6
But I just wanted to tell you that I am
completely overwhelmed by you. It's the
last thing I was expecting.

Person_2
This is also the last thing I was
expecting and I also feel completely
overwhelmed by you.

Person_6
That's a weird thing to say.

Person_2
Why? I just said what you said. Exactly
what you said.

Person_6
Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said
it.   It's okay.

Person_6
So listen, my parents are coming to
town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come
for lunch?

Person_2
Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule,
right? You'll come to Mary's party
Friday night and then you'll probably
spend the night. So I won't be able to
see you until Monday, so...

Person_6
Okay. Well, I would love to meet your
parents. They live in the city, right?

Person_2
Well, they live in the suburbs. You
know, I don't really see them very
much.

Person_6
Have they asked about me? What do they
think? Do they want to meet me? My
parents want to meet you.

Person_2
Of course, of course. They're dying to
meet you.

Person_6
Ow... oh my god..

Person_2
Are you okay? What happened?

Person_6
Totally fine.

Person_2
Do you need assistance?

Person_6
I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took
this stupid hip hop dance class last
weekend.

Person_2
You should get it looked at. Do you want
ice?

Person_6
Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally
fine.

Person_2
Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry
you? I can carry you the rest of the day?

Person_6
Kumail, seriously, stop.

Person_2
Hey, I liked your friends.     That Craig
guy or was it Greg?

Person_2
I can never tell with those names. I'm
glad I like him cause I don't want to
have to come up with excuses to avoid
him, you know. Like, oh no, I have
kite surfing tonight.

Person_2 (O.S.)
Did you know in the UK it's pronounced
"Crayg". Which is good because that's
actually how it's written, right? He's
a "Crate" guy.

Person_2
I was going to tell you about that.

Person_6
Are you like judging Pakistan's Next
Top Model or something? Seriously, who
are these women?

Person_2
You know how we have arranged marriage
in my culture? These are those women.

Person_6
These are women in Pakistan who want to
marry you?

Person_2
They're not in Pakistan.

Person_6
You've met these women?

Person_2
Just with my parents. We haven't like -

Person_6
You're not serious about this, are you?

Person_2
It's my mom's thing, I just go along with
it.

Person_6
So what does your mom think about you and
me, then?

Person_6
She doesn't know about me, does she?

Person_2
No.

Person_6
Fucking five months   of red flags. Oh my
god, I'm so stupid.   You ducking my
parents. Oh my god,   the two day rule!
Seriously, red flag   after red flag.
Such a liar!

Person_6
You lie to me. You lie to your parents.
And those are just the people you like!
Is there someone that you're not lying
to? I'd love to meet them, cause then I
could tell them what a fucking liar you
are!

Person_2
You didn't tell me about your being
divorced until recently. You were
hiding fucking something too!

Person_6
My divorce does not mean our future is
impossible. It actually means the
direct opposite. I'm not hiding
anything from you. Okay? I'm an open
fucking book. You wanna know what's in
my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and
stamps.

Person_2
Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you
supposed to be good at handling these
types of things.

Person_6
Where are my fucking shoes?

Person_2
Aren't you supposed to be handling this
better than you are right now?

Person_6
I'm expressing myself!

Person_2
You know what we call "arranged
marriage" in my culture, Emily?
Marriage! Okay? We just call it
marriage. There's another type of
marriage that's called "love marriage"
and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married
an Irish woman and he was kicked out of
the family! And nobody is allowed to
talk to him.

Person_6
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

Person_2
Because I didn't think you'd fucking
understand and I was fucking right!

Person_6
You don't think I could fathom your life
in any fucking way?

Person_2
I'm fighting a fourteen hundred year
old culture! You were ugly in high
school! There's a big fucking
difference!
I'm sorry. I can't lose my family.

Person_6
Can you imagine a world where we end up
together?

Person_2
I don't know.

Person_6
I have to go. Don't fucking call me.

Side_11
Multi-grain, pumpernickel, pita bread,
hot dog buns, croutons..I can't eat any
of it.

Side_12
I don't want kids. People say, Sam,
you're gonna love it. You're gonna have a
kid and he's gonna be your best friend.
A best friend that pukes on you and shits
everywhere, and is constantly screaming.
I already have friends like that. People
say, Sam...

Person_4
I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a
good person, I'm not saying she's not.
All I'm saying is this is the universe
telling you: seize your moment. Be a
little selfish and pursue your career.
Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on
Thursday. If you book the Montreal
Comedy Festival, it would change things
for you. You don't wanna get stuck in
Chicago, right? You don't wanna be like
Sam Highsmith. He's been doing the
"people say Sam" bit since '03.

Side_12
People say, Sam...

Person_4
Is that what you want?

Person_2
It's amazing. It's the same material.

Side_12
What do people say?

Side_8
Sam!

Side_12
People say what?

Side_8
Sam!

Side_12
I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much!

Person_2
I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him
how I actually feel about it.

Person_2
Great set, dude!

Side_12
Crushing it!

Person_2
Love the new stuff!

Person_2
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

Person_4
We're weak.

Side_13
I wouldn't really call it an obsession
but... I'm pretty good at magic.

Side_2
Can you make his belly disappear?

Person_9
No, I'm too happy with my belly.

Side_13
Does anyone have a dollar?

Person_9
I will give you something.

Side_13
20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't
you think he'd look cool with sunglasses?

Side_13
We sprinkle the magic dust on.

Person_2
Yeah, you can't do it without the magic
dust.

Side_13
Yeah, I need it. All right...

Side_13
Ok. Watching carefully -

Side_3
That is amazing! And he does look
better with glasses!

Person_2
How did you do that?

Side_13
Oh no, a magician never reveals her
tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr.
Nanjiani.

Person_9
Do you think I could use this twenty
dollar bill to buy something?

Side_13
It looks better now, right?

Person_2
I was watching this monster movie with my
friend and he turned to me and was like,
"what would you do in that situation?"
I'm never going to be one of the last
guys alive. I'm going to be the first guy
to die. I die so the other characters get
to find out something weird is going on.
I go off alone to find the cat.

Person_2
I never even find out that there were
monsters. To me, the plot of the movie
was "we're at a research facility and the
cat's missing." The end.

Person_2
Denise. This is your name in Urdu.

Side_14
Wow, that is so cool.

Side_15
Kumail? Hey, Bob Dalavan.

Person_2
Yeah, I know you.

Side_15
You had some very interesting premises in
your set tonight.

Person_2
Thanks.

Side_15
I just wanted you to know that you made
the finals for the Montreal Showcase.

Person_2
Oh my god. Thank you.

Side_15
You too, Mary. Congrats.

Person_3
Oh, ok!

Side_15
So we'll see you guys up there. We'll
be in touch.

Person_1
What about C-Dog?

Side_15
Who's that?

Person_1
Um, me. What about me?

Side_16
You know, funny stuff, okay?

Side_14
Do you wanna go somewhere?

Person_2
Yeah, let's go somewhere.

Person_2
Hello?

Person_7
Kumail. It's Jessie.

Person_2
Hey.     Who?

Person_7
Jessie. I'm in school with Emily.
Listen, Emily is in the hospital.

Person_2
What?

Person_2
Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um,
Emily Gardner? She was checked in...

Person_2
Hey.

Person_6
What are you doing here?

Person_2
Jessie called me and wanted me to make
sure you were okay. So how are you
doing?

Person_6
Fine. Totally fine. Never been better.
A thousand percent fine. Just like
fainted a little at work. I didn't have
breakfast this morning.

Person_2
Breakfast is the most important meal of
the day. You know that.

Side_17
Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready
soon. Okay?

Person_6
Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home
and sleep in my own bed.

Side_17
Sir, can you step outside a moment,
please? If you want to stay you have to
go to the security desk to get a pass.

Person_2
Where is the security desk?

Side_17
It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked
in. At the security desk.

Person_2
The security desk is at the security
desk. Got it.

Person_2
Can I get you something? Water. Juice.
Coffee?

Side_18
May I speak with you for a second?

Person_2
I'll be right back.

Side_18
There is a massive infection in her
lungs. All her vitals are elevated.
Does she have HIV?

Person_2
What? No. I mean she--

Side_18
Are you her husband?

Person_2
No--

Side_18
We need to intubate her immediately. I
need a family member to sign this. So
I'm going to ask you again. Are you her
husband?

Person_2
What does "intubate" mean?

Side_18
We have to put her on a respirator and
to do that we need to put her in a
medically induced coma.

Person_2
Coma.

Side_18
Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on
the infection. And it needs to happen
right now. So, I'm going to ask you one
last time, are you her husband?

Person_6
What's going on?! Where are you taking
me?

Side_19
You should call her family.

Person_2
I'm sorry.

Person_2
Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail,
Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be
calling you so late. Emily's fine.
Just want to get that taken care of.
She's fine. She is at City View
Hospital in Chicago in a medically
induced coma. But the doctors say that-
- Yes I did say coma.

Person_2
Hey. I'm Kumail.

Side_20
We know who you are Kumail.

Side_19
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would
like to see you now.

Side_20
Be right back.

Side_19
Listen, the doctor will be here any
minute. She's just running a little
late. Don't read anything into this
being in the bereavement room. It was
the only room we had available.

Side_21
Okay. Thank you.

Side_20
Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane.

Side_21
I know, I know. But it makes me feel
better.

Side_22
Hello.

Side_22
Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's
attending. I'll be coordinating all the
doctors and orchestrating her treatment
strategy.

Side_20
"All the doctors"? How many are there?

Side_22
Five.

Side_20
Five? Why so many? Is that normal?

Side_23
We immediately initiated orotracheal
intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected
her heart at this point.

Side_24
We don't know the exact nature of the
infection yet, but we've got her on a
broad spectrum of antibiotics.

Side_25
...critical infections centering around
the costodiaphragmatic--

Side_26
Our theory is methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus.

Side_21
Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an "f"
or a "ph"?

Side_26
Ph.

Person_2
That was very reassuring, wasn't it?
Apparently, there are good and bad
comas. And the kind that they put her
in, the medically induced ones, are
definitely the good kind of coma.

Person_2
Like you know how there are good and
bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good
or bad.

Side_21
Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle
things from here. You've been very
helpful. Thank you. For signing the
thing-

Person_2
My pleasure

Side_21
But you can go now.

Person_2
Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the
Mideast.

Person_1
What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
the airport get a boner. Does that mean
drugs or bombs?

Person_4
That's good. What if instead of it being
at the airport, you quit comedy and never
did comedy ever again?

Person_1
Fuck you. It's a good bit.

Person_4
Just for the sake of the public. So they
wouldn't have to look at your face or
hear your words.

Person_2
It's okay that I'm not there, right?
Like, I don't need to be there, right?

Side_12
What happened?

Person_1
He put his girlfriend in a coma. You
know, the way you do.

Person_3
He signed a paper that allowed doctors to
put her--

Person_4
He suggested it.

Person_2
She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
know medical stuff. That's what doctors
do. They're good at medical stuff. This
is a medically induced coma. This is
their specialty.

Person_3
Maybe.

Person_1
It might be a good thing. She might wake
up with a new skill. Like my cousin
blacked out once and when he came to, he
thought he knew a different language.

Person_4
Did he?

Person_1
No, it was just gibberish that he made
up. It was brain damage.

Side_12
I got another Taco Bell one...

Side_20
Did you forget something?

Person_2
Is she up yet?

Side_21
No, she's not. They won't tell us
anything. We've been here all morning.

Person_2
I know you guys said you don't need me
to stay, but I think I'm just going to
wait anyway.

Side_20
You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
you're here. You don't have to worry
about being committed to anything,
Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
awake. There's no need to do it when
she's unconscious.

Person_2
It's more complicated than that--

Side_20
Is it? Because I know about the two-day
rule, I know about the headshots and the
secrets. She tells us everything.
You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
have already done a lot.

Person_2
I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
seat- ?

Person_2
Is that lady still looking at me?

Side_21
No reason you should eat there by
yourself. Right, hon?

Side_20
It's a free country.

Person_2
How's your sandwich?

Side_20
Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.

Side_21
Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
You know, we're not by the water. Well,
we are by the water, but it's a lake.
There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
guess. Whatever the good dice number
is.

Side_21
So, uh, 9/11?

Side_21
No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a
conversation about it with...people.

Person_2
You've never talked to people about 9/11?

Side_21
No, uh, what's your stance?

Person_2
What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm...
Anti. It was a tragedy.
I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.

Side_20
Huh?

Person_2
That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
joke about it.

Person_2
Hey, can I come?

Side_21                            BETH
Yeah.                         No.

Side_20
Whatever.

Side_22
I know this isn't the news you were
hoping for but we aren't ready to bring
Emily out of the coma yet.

Side_20
Oh. I-

Side_21
What happened?

Side_22
The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
what we'd hoped they would, and we
don't want to mess around. So we're
going to perform surgery tomorrow
morning to remove the infection.

Side_20
Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
that the antibiotics would work. He
didn't say anything at all about
surgery.

Side_21
What does that mean? What kind of
surgery?

Side_22
It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
common procedure. We're going to go in
between the ribs and remove the
infection.

Side_21
How do you spell that please? Thora- ?
What's the last part?

Side_22
-Centesis.

Side_20
And where is the infection?

Side_22
On the lung.

Side_20
What's the risk?

Side_22
Low. My advice to you is that you go
home, you get something to eat, and try
to relax.

Side_21
She left the lights on, eh?

Side_20
My favorite sweater.

Side_20
I'm gonna do some research.

Side_21
Oh hey, that's the book I gave her.

Side_20
No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you
have that little notebook from the
doctors?

Side_21
No, this is the book I gave her.

Person_2
I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms
real quick.

Side_20
I remember. I met her at the falafel
place and then we went to that book store
that's hardly ever open and I bought it
for her.

Side_21
You're not the only one who gives her
things.

Side_20
What's up with you?

Side_21
I'm just tired of you thinking that
you're the only one who gives her things.
I gave her that book.

Side_20
Look at the inscription.

Side_21
No. That's stupid.

Person_2
Hey.

Side_21
Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I
was just wondering if we wanna do
anything. Got any parlor games...

Person_2
I don't-what are parlor games?

Side_21
Card games, word games. You play any word
games?

Person_2
No, I've never played-

Side_21
You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?

Person_2
How does that go?

Side_21
It's basically where you try to find a
word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme.

Person_2
Ok, Stonehenge.

Side_21
Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a
winner.

Person_2
I don't play board games. I play video
games.

Side_21
That's the thing. Everybody now needs
Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a
thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a
piece of chalk and a pavement, that's
your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac
toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you
go, three games right there.

Person_2
Jimmy was a real guy?

Side_21
Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy,
whoever got hit with the chalk, he was
the Jimmy.

Side_21
I'm just trying to figure out what to do.

Person_2
Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd
love to, but I'm actually gigging
tonight, which is like an industry word
we use for when we do shows.

Side_21
Really?

Person_2
Yeah, there's a big Montreal Comedy
festival audition coming up, and I'm
actually headlining tonight.

Side_21
Oh. That's cool. I haven't been to
comedy show since the 80's - Rita
Rudner at Caroline's. Remember that,
hon?

Side_20
Christ. Pleural effusion and empyema, --

Side_21
Maybe we should go to Kumail's show.
What do you think? Wouldn't that be
fun?

Side_20
Oh my god. These pictures are horrible.

Side_21
Okay listen, why don't we go to the
comedy club with him? It'll take our
mind off of things right now.

Side_20
I don't want to get my mind off it,
Terry. Our daughter's having surgery
tomorrow.

Side_21
Please. I need the distraction.

Side_20
Well then why don't you go?

Side_21
No, I want you to come with me. I don't
wanna be alone.

Side_20
All right. But I'm bringing my iPad.

Person_2
Ah it's sold out. I should've said it
before you guys had the whole
discussion. It sold out super quickly.
They were shocked at how quickly it
sold out.

Side_21
But you can get us in? You're the
headliner, right? That's what you said.
I mean, if you're the headliner, you
can get two more in, right?

Person_2
That's a good point.

Side_21
We'll sit in the back. They got food
there?

Person_2
They've got waffle fries and um-

Side_21
The hospital had waffle fries too.

Side_28
I've actually never been to   Pakistan. My
parents moved here for grad   school and
they just stayed here. I've   never even
been to Canada. So uh, when   is Kumail
coming?

Side_2
He's coming. Right, Naveed? Traffic?

Side_1
I heard everything's bumper-to-bumper
on the Dan Ryan Expressway.

Side_28
That's weird because I took the Dan
Ryan Expressway here.

Person_1
What is your dad's sister's favorite kind
of music to dance to?

Person_2
Emily's parents are here.

Person_3
Tonight? Why?

Person_1
Is anybody here from out of town?

Person_1
A few, a few. What's your name, sir?

Side_21
Terry.

Person_1
Terry. And who's this lady next to you?
Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth?

Side_20
It's Beth.

Person_1
Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where
are you guys from?

Side_21
We're from North Carolina.

Person_1
Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State!
Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what
brings you to Chicago?

Side_20
Our daughter's in a coma.

Person_1
Where are you from?

Side_28
It's getting late, I should go.

Person_9
No, I think I should call him up, I'll
just call him up.
Hello, Kumi-beta? What do you mean, who
is calling? This is your father. Ok, ok.
He will be here any moment.
I just faked that call. Did you call
him?

Side_1
A hundred times. No response.

Side_28
I think I should make something clear.
I can understand what you're saying.

Side_3
I thought you said you'd never been to
Pakistan.

Side_28
I said I'd never been there but we speak
it at home.

Person_9
For someone who's never been to Pakistan
you speak Urdu very well.

Side_28
Thanks.

Person_9
Do you want to sing?

Person_2
I want to name my kid Void so he won't be
able to cash any of his paychecks.

Person_2
I'm sorry, sir, this says Void on it. But
that's my name. Curse you, father!
I work on the second floor of the bank in
this fantasy scenario.

Side_29
Go back to ISIS!

Person_2
Toast is a really strange food.

Side_20
What did you just say?

Side_29
I said, he should go back to ISIS.

Person_2
Toast is the only food that-

Side_20
Well that's a really confusing
position. Do you want ISIS to have more
people?

Side_29
No I was saying that to him because...

Side_20
Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS
recruiter here.

Person_2
Glad we got to the bottom of that.
Toast is like a-

Side_20
What is it about him that made you say
that?

Person_2
I think we know what the answer is.

Side_29
Lady I wasn't talking to you.

Side_20
What is it about him?

Person_2
We don't have to go down this path. We
know what's at the end of it.

Side_29
Cuz of how he looks.

Person_2
There it is.

Side_20
That is like saying that all frat boys
wearing country club hats and Hawaiian
shirts have shriveled up, tiny little
dicks!

Person_2
Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for
you to find out, but he's right. I
actually am a terrorist. I just do
stand-up comedy on the side to keep a
low profile.

Side_29
Fuck you.

Person_2
First of all, very clever. Did you write
that at home? Toast is-

Side_20
Fuck you!

Side_29
Fuck you.

Side_20
No fuck you!

Side_29
You're a bitch, you know that?

Side_20
(being dragged out by
security)
I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your
fucking phone number?!

Side_21
I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry.

Side_21
I'm not sorry actually cause you're a
terrible person... I don't want to kick
your ass here in front of everybody.
Yeah, that's right. I've got levels,
motherfucker. This elevator goes all
the way fucking down, you fucking
prick!

Side_20
I think I'll make tea.
Actually I'll open a bottle of wine.
Does Emily have whiskey?

Person_2
On top of the fridge.

Side_21
So uh, Cubs doing good, huh?

Person_2
I don't know anything about baseball.

Side_20
I am so sorry about that. That was... I
just sort of lost control.

Side_21
I thought it was sexy.

Person_2
Me too. Not like sexy, but like cool
sexy. Not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna
not say sexy anymore.

Side_20
Hey, you guys wanna get something to eat?

Side_20
So is it always like that?

Person_2
Oh like tonight? No, usually a
different mom comes in to help me. I'm
joking. No, it's not always like that.
I'd quit if it was.

Side_21
Here's a joke.

Side_20
No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as
funny as a fart at a funeral.

Side_21
This is funny, this is a funny one. A
giraffe walks into a bar and he says to
the bartender, "Highballs on me." You
get it, right?

Person_2
Oh that was the end of the joke?

Side_21
Yes.

Person_2
That was the whole joke?

Side_21
That's the joke. That's the beauty of it,
boom.

Person_2
I thought there was more.

Side_21
He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would
stand to reason his testicles are high
and a highball is a type of drink, and
you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny
first.

Person_2
No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly
explained.

Side_21
You're just busting my high balls.

Side_21
Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel.
Good. How about you?

Person_2
Hmm, fruit-forward.

Side_21
Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward.

Person_2
This one is in the front seat. It's
driving the wine car.

Side_21
Exactly.

Side_20
I like wine cause of the buzz.

Side_21
She's a bit of a lightweight.

Side_20
So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the
sofa in less than an hour!

Side_21
Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not
true.

Side_20
You weren't supposed to be on the show
tonight, were you?

Person_2
Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah
I was. I was the headliner.

Person_2
Okay. I lied about the show to get out
of hanging out with you guys. And then
I lied about headlining to impress you
guys.

Side_20
Well that didn't work.

Person_2
Also, I think I screwed up with your
daughter.

Side_20
Yeah, you did.
I don't know how people do it when
their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he
got cancer, then he had a stroke, then
a heart attack, then he had a
recurrence of the cancer. But you know
what killed him?

Person_2
Cancer?

Side_20
Car accident. We think maybe it was a
heart attack while he was driving. And
he did still have cancer too. And you
know what? He ate sprouts his whole
fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30
years. I don't know how I'm going to
sleep tonight.

Person_2
You wanna stress eat?

Side_20
Fuck yeah.

Person_2
Oh my god.

Side_20
Most noticeable. Oh no, hold on,
there's more.

Side_20
The legendary cemetery photo shoot.

Person_2
Oh my god.

Side_20
I laughed so hard when I saw these. She
got so mad at me.

Person_2
You're gonna wake him up.

Side_20
Are you kidding me? He can sleep through
anything. Hey Terry!

Person_2
How did you and Terry meet?

Side_20
I was going to East Carolina University
and I was waiting tables. We met at
this coffee shop, I was waiting on him.
I liked his hair. He was a teacher
already. Thick New York accent like
nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for
me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
family could not stand him. We're all
military people, army pilots. All my
brothers played football. Terry
couldn't even change a tire. My father
got so mad he broke every dinner plate
we had. Now back then, you go to the
gas station, you fill up your tank, you
get a dinner plate. But just one at a
time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of
fill-ups to get the whole set back. And
Terry just stuck around. Eventually
they just all got over it.

Person_2
They just got over it. How?

Side_20
Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your
parents meet, Kumail?

Person_2
So we have arranged marriage as you
know. A big group got together to see a
movie, but really it was just a set up
so my mom and dad could meet.

Side_20
What movie did they see?

Person_2
I have no idea. I never asked.

Side_20
She's great, you know?

Person_2
I know.

Side_20
I feel good about this surgery.

Person_2
Yeah. These doctors know what they're
doing.

Side_20
No they don't. They're just winging it
like everybody else.

Person_2
Fuck.

Person_6'S VOICE
Hey it's me. So I tried making some
Pakistani food to surprise you. And
either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani
food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye!

Person_6'S VOICE
Hey it's me. If you just wanna come over
and like kiss me for two seconds, I'd
really love that tonight. Ok. Bye!

Person_6'S VOICE
Hey it's me. So did you want to meet at
the gallery, or - Oh my god! Oh my god, a
bird just hit me in the head. Oh my god
I'm not kidding. I'll call you right
back. Oh my god, is it okay?

Side_26
The infection around the lungs was
removed. We should be able to pull her
out soon.

Side_21
Oh boy.

Side_20
How soon?

Side_26
She should be up by tomorrow morning at
the latest. We'll also test the pleural
fluid from the thoracentesis so we can
create a more targeted antibiotic
strategy.

Side_20
So this is good news?

Side_26
It's very good news. We'll just hold
onto her for a few more days and then
you can have her back.

Side_21
She's a fighter, right?

Side_26
Yes.

Side_2
I was so worried. We saw on the news
that a train derailed and we thought
that you were on the train and you had
died.

Person_2
Nobody died on that train, Ma.

Side_2
But did they look under the train?

Person_9
So, where were you last night? What were
you doing?

Person_2
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

Side_2
Kumail.

Person_2
Alright, I'll tell you. I was...
studying for the LSAT.

Side_2
Really?

Person_2
Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm
gonna go to law school, become a
lawyer, and do law.

Side_2
Oh, let me see who that could be.

Person_2
Really, Dad? You said that nobody was
gonna come. That it was gonna be just
us.

Side_1
Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People
say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him?

Person_2
Yeah, I know.

Side_3
He should be on Saturday Night Live.

Side_2
Everybody remember Khadija? She just
dropped in. She was just in the
neighborhood.

Side_2
And these are her parents, Farhan and
Tina. They also just dropped in.

Side_13
I've just been through so many of these
appointments and I never have anything in
common with the guys. You know when girls
at work complain about dating, I just
want to body slam them. They have no
idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm
becoming the bruised apple at the bottom
of the apple bucket.

Person_2
No, no. You're not.

Side_13
I am.

Person_2
You're not.

Side_13
So do you want to hangout sometime? Like
without our parents? Have you been to the
cat cafe? The cats just come up to you
and nestle in your lap and you just pet
them.

Person_2
I don't think that's a good idea.

Side_13
You don't like cats?

Person_2
I mean I don't think it's a good idea for
us to hangout again. It's not you. You're
fantastic. I just can't do this arranged
marriage thing -- with anybody.

Side_13
So why did you meet me?

Person_2
It wasn't my idea.

Side_13
I'm just really tired. Do you ever want
to just be in a relationship so you can
finally relax?

Person_2
I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.

Side_13
People are always telling me what I
deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so
sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.

Side_13
And you know what? I watched the X-Files,
like three whole episodes, and it's a bad
show.

Side_21
Wow, they should call this website,
"Everything is Cancer Dot Com".
Everything you put in, it could be
cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on.
You take the fun out of hiccups now.

Side_20
Do you know this is the 17th best
hospital in Chicago?

Side_21
Really? Out of how many?

Side_20
I don't know, but Northwestern's number
one.

Side_21
Well how do they rate it? What's their
methodology?

Side_20
I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad.

Side_21
It's not great, unless the sample size
is, you know, that all depends.

Person_2
Here, look at the comments.

Side_21
This is why I don't want to go online
cause it's never good. You go online,
they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best
movie ever.

Side_22
Terry - Hi. Can we talk?

Side_21
Yeah.

Side_22
We got the biopsy results. They are
unfortunately inconclusive. We are
concerned-

Side_21
They couldn't find out what the disease
was, or where the virus came from or
the bacteria or whatever.

Person_2
But they took out the infection so it
shouldn't matter?

Side_21
I know, that's what I said but her
vitals didn't normalize. And now they
say that the infection is continuing to
spread, it's in her kidneys.

Person_2
But the kidneys are so far from the
lungs.

Side_21
I know, it's an aggressive infection
and they said what they gotta do now is
figure out what this mystery disease
actually is.

Side_20
I'm calling Northwestern.

Side_21
Just hold on, hold on.

Side_20
Terry! Goddammit!

Person_2
I think we should talk about this--

Side_20
--You shut up! I'm sick of this shit,
Terry. We're getting her out of here!

Side_21
They're in the middle of the whole
process of elimination.

Side_20
So you're saying Northwestern can't
take that information and continue the
search? This place is a shithole.

Side_20
I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?

Side_21
Will you just stop for a second? They're
the doctors. You act like you know what
you're talking about. You don't.

Side_20
I can't find my cellphone. You got a
phone?

Side_21
Don't give her a phone. You don't need a
phone. You don't need to call anybody
right now.

Side_21
They're doing it. They're the experts
here, and I trust them.

Side_20
Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can
you unlock that thing?

Side_21
Oh - you think that you're smarter than
me because you say big sentences. Well
you're not!

Side_20
I don't think I'm smarter than you! You
just don't think you're as smart as I
am! That's not my fault!

Side_21
Right. It's never your fault.
Everything's my fault.

Side_20
Oh there are some things that are
definitely just your fault.

Side_21
Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop
freaking out and calm down.

Side_20
And you need to stop being a coward.

Side_21
Greatest hits, coming back. You can
stop, I'll replay the rest of this from
memory.

Side_19
Oh, you're giraffe-ing it.

Person_2
It was the biggest thing they had. I
don't even know if she likes giraffes. We
never talked about giraffes. Hey, do
they know what they're doing? Cause
they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme
Disease? You know the girl on The Real
World had it? Did you guys look for
that?

Side_19
Yes, we did.

Person_2
Did you know she gets hurt all the
time? She messed up her ankle recently -
could that be Lupus?

Side_19
Kumail. We're looking into everything.
We're not holding anything back from
you. We're still just eliminating
possibilities.

Person_2
Cause Beth wants to move her to
Northwestern.

Side_19
Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The
hospital will approve it because it'll
get the liability off their hands, but
we put her in a coma for a reason. To
stabilize her. Moving her could be very
dangerous. The infection could spread.
Trust me she is fighting. And so are
we.

Person_2
Hey Terry. I was just talking to the
nurse - You okay?

Side_21
Yeah, of course. Totally fine.

Side_21
Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait
here until they kick me out. Keep an
eye on her.

Person_2
Do you wanna crash at my place?

Side_21
You got the golf channel?

Person_2
No.

Side_21
That wasn't funny, right?

Person_2
I thought that was a serious question.

Side_21
Let's get the fuck out of here.

Person_2
So this is the place.

Side_21
Wow...this place is terrible.

Person_2
Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was
saying that moving Emily could be a bad
idea.

Side_21
Really?

Person_2
Yeah, she said it could be dangerous.

Person_2
Like...

Side_21
No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
to trade places with Emily. Being a
parent, it's a nightmare. Loving
somebody this much sucks.

Person_2
Yeah.

Side_21
And I guess you've noticed some tension
between Beth and me.

Person_2
Not really. That's none of my business.

Side_21
Yeah well, it's there. Big time.

Person_2
It's getting really late. We should go
to sleep.

Side_21
I cheated on her.

Person_2
Fuuuuck.

Side_21
I did. It was just a one night stand.

Person_2
Okay.

Side_21
We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
have these teacher conferences. Who
goes to a math conference to get laid?

Person_2
Math teachers?

Side_21
Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's
what it was.

Person_2
Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a
full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-

Side_21
She just smelled so good. It was horrible
too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
as I'd finished, I was like, what did you
fucking do?! What did you just do?!

Side_21
What did you do?! You know that moment of
clarity you get right after an orgasm?

Person_2
Yup.

Side_21
I told Beth right away. I had to. She
was devastated. Now she hates me.

Person_2
She might be mad at you, but she doesn't
hate you. You should've heard the way she
was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you
something? Why did you tell her?

Side_21
Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt.

Person_2
Do you guys talk about it?

Side_21
Not anymore. She said she forgave me,
but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
some advice Kumail. You're going to
know the woman you want to spend the
rest of your life with when you cheat
on her. When you cheat on her and you
just feel like shit.

Person_2
So, to fully know I love someone, I
have to cheat on them?

Side_21
Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's
terrible advice.

Side_21
Love isn't easy. That's why they call
it love.

Person_2
I don't really get that either.

Side_21
I know. I thought I could just start
saying something and something smart
would come out.

Person_2
Hey did you see Terry?

Person_1
No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm
going to Sevies. You want anything?

Person_2
No, I'm good, thank you.

Person_1
You don't want a hot dog or nothing?

Person_2
Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.

Person_1
Okay, no hot dog.

Side_2
We just spoke to Khadija's parents.

Person_2
What are you doing here?

Side_2
What is wrong with you, Kumi?

Person_2
Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-

Side_2
Sorry? That's all you have to say?

Person_2
I wasn't that into her.

Side_2
"Into her"? Do you know how difficult
it is to get an appointment with her?
She is in very high demand.

Person_2
Okay. So?

Side_2
So?

Person_2
Can we please talk about this another
time?

Side_2
No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this
now. We have sacrificed everything for
you.

Person_2
I know, okay?

Side_2
We have left our family. We have left
our home. I have missed the birth of my
sister's daughter. I have not seen my
mother for fifteen years. Your father,
he had to do his graduate school.
Again. He had to give exams. Again.

Person_9
I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s.
They used to call me Father Time!

Person_2
I know that. I really appreciate
everything you did for me, but can we
talk about this another time?

Side_2
Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer,
fine. If you want to do the stand-up
comedy and embarrass us as a family,
fine. There is only one thing that we
have ever asked from you: that you be a
good Muslim and that you marry a
Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!

Person_2
Can I ask you something that has never
made sense to me? Why did you bring me
here if you wanted me to not have an
American life?

Person_2
We come here but we pretend like we're
still back there? That's so stupid!

Person_9
Don't you talk to your mother like
that!

Person_2
You don't care what I think. You just
want me to follow the rules. But the
rules don't make sense to me. I don't
pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in
years. I just go down there and I play
video games.

Person_9
You don't believe in Allah?

Person_2
I don't know what I believe, Dad! I
don't know. And I can't marry someone
you find for me.

Side_2
And why not?

Person_2
Because I'm in love with someone. I am.
Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a
therapist. And right now she's very
sick but I couldn't tell you that. It
makes me so sad that I couldn't tell
you any of that. I really appreciate
everything you've done for me. I truly,
truly do. And I know Islam has been
really good for you, it has made you
good people, but I don't know what I
believe. I just need to figure it out
on my own.

Side_2
You're not my son.

Person_9
Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not
thinking about us. You're not thinking
about Khadija. In fact you're not even
thinking about that girl that you are in
love with. You think American Dream is
just about doing whatever you want and
not thinking about other people?

Person_9
You're wrong! You are wrong!

Person_1
Hey... I never went to the store. I was
just listening at the door. My mom kicked
me out for dealing weed at sixteen, so I
get it man.

Person_2
Hey, so when are we going to talk to Beth
about what we talked about?

Side_21
We're gonna move her.

Person_2
What? What are you talking about? You
fucking caved?

Side_21
I didn't cave. I don't cave.

Person_2
Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're
great. But we talked about this last
night.

Side_21
I know. We're moving her. She's right.

Person_2
What? No. I told you what the nurse
said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that
moving Emily could be a very bad idea.

Side_20
Well Northwestern told us it could be
very good.

Person_2
Well, they don't see her. This nurse
sees her and she told me herself.

Side_21
It's okay. They don't need to see her.

Person_2
It's not okay. There. I got it!

Side_21
That's a map of the garage.

Person_2
Wait, wait! Do you want to be
responsible? She could die!

Side_20
Kumail, we're responsible for her no
matter what. We're her parents. Now I'm
sorry, we're moving her.

Side_31
Welcome to Quick'n Hot. May I take your
order please?

Person_2
Yeah, um can I get a burger with 4
slices of cheese.

Side_31
Four burgers. Anything else sir?

Person_2
No. One burger with four slices of
cheese.

Person_2
One burger with four-

Side_31
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

Person_2
Just put 4 slices of cheese on a
burger.

Side_31
We can't do that. There's no button -

Person_2
Who the fuck is this "we", man? Who the
fuck is this "we"? It's me and you.
We're just people. Fucking listen to
me. Fuck this corporate entity. Put
four slices of cheese on THE FUCKING

Side_31
We can't do that.

Person_2
What the fuck, you fucking idiot?

Person_2
Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human
being. You're a human being. Look at
me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck
me! Look at me. PLEASE!

Side_31
Today's my first day.

Person_2
Fuck you!

Side_31
I'll just ring you up for four burgers.

Person_2
I'm sorry.

Side_31
Do you want any fries or drink with
that?

Person_2
I'll take four fries. I'm sorry.

Person_2
Fuck!

Person_1
Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh
wait, are you getting all dark and
moody before your set? Yeah, punish
yourself like a nasty little baby.

Person_2
I am not in the mood. Okay Chris?

Person_1
I'll get you in the mood.

Person_1
I'll get you all in the mood.

Person_4
You all right?

Person_2
Why does everybody say the same fucking
thing? Yeah, I'm doing great.

Person_4
Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking.

Person_5
The fuck've you been, man? You're on
next!

Person_5
This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail
Nanjiani!

Person_2
Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? Like that's the
name of it, it's called cheese. I saw
all these news reports, and they were
like, there's a new drug, it's called
cheese. Everyone's doing it in the
Midwest, kids are doing it.

Person_2
It's just really hard to do stand-up
comedy when your girlfriend is in a
coma.

Person_2
Not quite sure what part you're
laughing at. They say she's fighting,
but she doesn't look like she's
fighting. She looks like she's just
laying there. I said horrible things to
her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
she gets excited every time she sees a
bird. She's like, look at this, it's a
bird. And I'm always like, yeah,
they're all over the place, they're
birds. But she likes that bird. Every
bird she sees, she sees it.

Person_2
Her dad just called and said that they
can't transfer her because the infection
has reached her heart. Which means...
She could die.

Person_2
I don't know if you can hear me or not,
but it would be really good if you pulled
through. If you have to go, you can go,
but it would be really great if you
stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I
did -

Person_6
Mom. You're getting your tears all over
me. When am I gonna be able to feel my
face?

Side_21
You gave us quite a scare there, Scout.

Person_6
Scout?

Side_21
Come on. I call you that all the time.

Person_6
No. Not since I was a grown up.

Side_21
I've called you that your whole life!

Side_19
Sorry hon.

Person_6
What is that crap?

Side_19
We have to thicken your liquids for a
bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough
to swallow yet.

Person_6
That shit tastes like semen.

Side_21
That's nice for a father to hear.

Side_22
She won't have any social inhibitions
until the anesthetic wears off.

Person_6
It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try
this.

Side_20
Oh wait a minute, honey!

Side_21
Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us
forty eight dollars for it, don't worry
about it.

Person_6
Why are you here?

Person_2
I haven't heard her voice in a while.

Side_20
He's been here the whole time.

Side_22
Could I speak with you both outside?

Side_20
Honey, we'll be right outside.

Person_2
Hey.

Side_22
Emily has a rare condition called Adult
Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
still hadn't gone down even after
several days in bed, which is strange.
Still's disease is when the body thinks
healthy tissue is an infection so it
tries to fight it. It's like a big
biological misunderstanding.

Side_21
Yeah, yeah.

Side_32
We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
stabilized within hours. She's gonna
take time to recover but she'll be
fine.

Side_21
Wow.

Person_6
What are you doing here?

Person_2
I was visiting someone down the hall and
I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi
to Emily.

Person_6
Oh.

Person_2
No, I'm joking, I was here for you.

Person_6
You're an asshole and I don't like you.

Person_2
I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.

Person_6
No, you're an asshole.

Person_2
You have a lot of drugs in you so you're
not thinking as clearly.

Person_6
Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
to me. You just make me sad. You make me
sad inside of my heart, and it makes me
sad to look at you. So I think you should
probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
want her.

Person_6
Will you please get my mom?

Person_2
Emily wants to see you.

Person_2
I'm gonna head out. I don't think I
should be here.

Side_21
Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your
living condition is a potential health
risk and you're not that funny. But....
you're probably not suited to do
anything else either so that's
troublesome--

Person_2
You really made it sound like you were
going to say something positive there.

Side_21
I guess I did, didn't I? You know I
know the good stuff. You know how I
feel. I gotta get in there.

Person_2
So you gonna hang around Chicago for a
while?

Side_20
Yeah. She's got physical therapy.

Person_2
Did you ever think you'd be excited to
have your daughter go through physical
therapy?
It's so strange that we could go
through one of the most intense
experiences of our lives together and
just never see each other again.

Side_20
Maybe. But I hope not.

Person_3
Hi little sad man. Mopey boy. We have
something to tell you. We are moving to
New York. And we want you to come with
us.

Person_2
Are you serious?

Person_4
You gotta do it. It's going to suck at
first but we'll have each other and
maybe eventually get paid to write
jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on
dude.

Person_3
You have to come. I know you did not
get Montreal and that is only because
you did one of the worst sets I've ever
seen in my goddamn life.

Person_4
It was nonsense.

Person_3
A living disgrace.

Person_4
I would call it shit, but I would be
worried that I'd be insulting actual
shit.

Person_3
Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I
thought a ghost had passed right through
me.

Person_2
We don't have to keep going over how bad
the set was. I saw their faces and the
noises they didn't make.

Person_3
I felt one of my eggs die.

Person_2
Doesn't that happen every month?

Person_3
It happens every month, Kumail, but I
don't always feel it and go, ohhhhh. And
that's what you made me do. I'm packing
my things up and I'm moving to New York,
and guess what, baby? You're coming with
me.

Person_2
What about Chris?

Person_3
He will be fine.

Person_4
There's not enough room in the car,
probably. We leave in a week, all
right? And I already called shotgun
Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this
up.

Person_3
Your destiny awaits!

Person_4
This will be the biggest move of your
life. Other than the one from Pakistan.

Side_21
Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody
for coming. I just wanted to say a
couple of words here.

Person_6
Why is Kumail here?

Side_20
Cause he was there the whole time. I
invited the nurses, I invited him.

Side_21
Emily, come on up here. I wanna say
something.

Side_21
Emily successfully peeled an orange
this morning.

Side_21
It was a clementine, full disclosure,
it's those little ones that a baby
monkey could peel, but she did it. And
that's all, thank you everybody.

Person_2
Hey. I like your cane. I've heard
pimpin' ain't easy.

Person_6
Right.

Person_2
Hey, can we talk for a second?

Person_6
Sure.

Person_2
So, I've been collecting some things
that are important to me and I wanted
to show them to you. I call this my bag
of devotion.

Person_2
This is all the visitor passes from
when I visited you when you were in the-

Person_2
These are the ticket stubs from when
your parents came to see me perform and
I realized how great they are, and how
great you are, and how great honesty
is.

Person_6
What did you do? Did you cremate
someone?

Person_2
These are the ashes of all the
Pakistani women - not the women - the
pictures of the Pakistani women. I
thought this was a good idea, but it
feels a little stupid.

Person_2
I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But
I've changed. And I am the person you
need me to be. I really am. So, will
you take me back?

Person_6
Kumail, I'm really glad that you went
through this experience, but you have
to understand that all that happened
while I was asleep. Like you felt one
way a few weeks ago and now you're
saying you feel the total opposite way
and the only thing that's changed is
that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
at all of this, and I just think, I
can't do it again. I can't be the
reason that you don't have a family. It
just feels totally different now. And I
can't do that again. Do you understand?

Person_2
Okay.

Person_2
Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no
plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I
won't let you kick me out of the
family. Since I am a member of the
family, it would stand to reason that I
would get a vote in whether or not I
get kicked out, and that vote would
have to be unanimous. Standard
parliamentary procedure. So all those
in favor of not kicking Kumail out of
the family, raise your hand.

Person_2
Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the
family, denied. So you guys can just
talk to me.

Person_2
Okay, you're giving me the silent
treatment. I figured that was what was
going to happen. I have a solution.

Person_2
"Hi. How are you?" It's just a real
basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical.
"Always with the comedy." Mom, made
that one specially for you. "Kumail,
how did you become so much more
handsome than your brother Naveed?"

Side_1
Bullshit.

Person_2
I admit this one is designed to stir up
some controversy. "It's interesting how
you can't really kick someone out of your
family because they'll always be your
family." I agree with that one. It's a
good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
for you.

Person_2
I'm sorry I lied about the girls and
the LSAT and all of that. That was
wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving
to New York to pursue stand-up, but I
am not leaving this family.

Person_6
What is it?

Person_6
Okay.

Person_6
I swear you and Dad are just like my
freshman year roommate, but instead of
boning random dudes, you're just
parenting all the time. All over the
place. In every room of the house.
Including right next to me.

Side_20
We gotta go.

Person_6
Home?

Person_6
No.

Side_20
Yeah, it's time.

Person_6
I'm not ready.

Side_20
Yeah, you know what? You're strong and
you are.

Person_2
And we'd go to the mosque and hear
graphic details of religious people
being killed 1400 years ago. I mean
like Tarantino-esque details. And
everyone would be crying, like
competing to see who could cry the
hardest. And I could never cry. And I
was like, what is wrong with me? Am I
broken?

Person_2
The only time I've cried that much is
when I watched the first 15 minutes of
Up. This is a picture of me and my
mother. I'm seven years old.

Side_21
You know people talk about New York
water but Chicago water is very
underrated, I think. It's good.

Person_6
Hey guys, I think I might just pop out
for a bit.

Side_21
By yourself?

Person_6
Yeah, just hop around the block, maybe
get some frozen yogurt.

Side_21
Are you okay? Can you do it, can you walk
by yourself?

Person_6
Yeah, Dad.

Side_20
Have fun.

Side_21
If you feel a coma coming on, call us.

Person_6
Dad, it's too soon. I love you, I'll see
you in the morning.

Side_21
Love you, bye.

Side_20
Have fun.

Person_6
I will.

Side_21
Got your phone?

Person_6
Yeah.

Person_2
But you liked it, huh?

Side_1
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

Person_2
Hey!

Person_6
Hi...

Person_2
What are you doing here?

Person_6
I was in the neighborhood and I saw
that you were gonna be here so I
thought I'd come say hi.

Person_2
You look great. How's your blood oxygen
level?

Person_6
Oh, well within range.

Person_2
Nice.

Person_2
Uh, this is my brother, Naveed.

Person_6
Hi, I'm Emily.

Side_1
I've heard lots about you.

Person_6
It's so good to finally meet you.
There's actually something I wanted to
tell you.

Side_1
Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye.

Side_20
Are you warm enough?

Side_21
Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of
socks on.

Side_20
Do you mind?

Side_21
No... no...

Side_20
I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.

Side_21
Me too. See? I should have brushed my
teeth.

Side_20
I like it.

Person_6
When something like this happens,
there's this sort of expectation that
you're going to have this completely
new lease on life and feel totally
different about everything. Like
cherish every sunrise. And for the most
part I just feel like, ugh I can't get
up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like
I've been talking about myself so much.
Are you doing a lot of stand-up?

Person_2
Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy
Festival audition, like horrifically.

Person_6
I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be
honest with you, it wasn't great.

Person_2
I know.

Person_6
But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I
liked.

Person_2
I'm moving to New York.

Person_6
Really?

Person_2
Yeah. Mary and CJ and I are just gonna
drive out. We have a place already.

Person_6
When do you leave?

Person_2
Next weekend.

Person_6
I'm so excited for you. That is great.
I think you are going to do so great in
New York.

Person_2
What were you going to say?

Person_6
What?

Person_2
You said you were going to say something
to me. What was it?

Person_6
Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My
parents told me everything you did for me
and I feel like the last time we spoke I
didn't properly thank you so-

Person_2
Oh yeah. Totally fine.

Person_6
I should probably go.

Person_2
Do you wanna call an Uber?

Person_6
No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has
been really great. Okay, bye.

Person_1
The scene is gonna be so different with
you guys gone.

Person_2
You should... come out...

Person_1
Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.

Person_2
I'm gonna miss you.

Person_1
Get out of here, you assholes.

Person_3
Come here, you big dummy.

Person_9
You are still kicked out of the family,
but because we did not get a proper
chance to say bye to you... Your mother
is so angry with you. She is not going
to get out of the car. She's not even
going to look at you. And I don't
believe you kept so much secret from
me, your father.

Person_2
I'm sorry.

Person_9
Here. She asked me to give this to you.

Person_9
Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite.
She made it herself specially for you
with extra potatoes.

Person_2
Thank you Ma.

Person_2
Is she okay?

Person_9
Right now? No.

Person_2
I'll miss you.

Person_9
I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It
was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye
forever. And do me a favor, when you
reach New York, just text us and tell
us that you've reached safely, okay?

Person_2
Dad, can I ask you something? When you
and Mom went on your first date, what
movie did you see?

Person_9
Satte pe Satta.

Person_9
Her favorite song. Why are you asking?

Person_2
Just curious.

Person_2
So the first time I came to America, I
was fourteen and I was just visiting my
uncle in New York and it just happened
to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
this is every day in America! As
advertised. Every day they have a party
celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
up to that day. So I was lying to my
parents, I was telling them I was gonna
be a lawyer. And they're very
disappointed cause they wanted me to be
a doctor. And you guys are like, why
didn't you just tell them that you
wanted to be a doctor?

Person_2
It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
has to be believable. If I told them I
want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
"bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
ISIS, then comedian.

Person_2
Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
heckle comedians.

Person_6
Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
woo-hooed you.

Person_2
Well see that's a common misconception.
Heckling doesn't have to be negative.

Person_6
So if I was like, oh my god, you're
amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?

Person_2
Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs
than me, and I don't like that. Do you
want to come up, do my job? Are you from
out of town, m'am?

Person_6
Chicago.

Person_2
Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to
New York?

Person_6
I'm here to see someone.

Person_2
And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I
don't know what your deal is.

Person_6
Yeah, I've seen him.

Person_1
Jeez... knock off the chatter, will
ya.

Person_2
Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

Person_1
I'm awake! Where do you come up with
all that crap about women?

Person_2
It's true. Women are very complex,
but if you know how to read 'em...
they're an open book. You can always
tell the rotten apples from the
peaches.

Person_1
Are you kiddin'?

Person_2
I'd stake my career on it. Anybody
ever proves me wrong, I'll throw
away my badge.

Person_1
Aayyhh... women are trouble...

Person_2
I used to believe that too. Until I
married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.

Person_1
Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,
pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a
beautiful wife waitin' for ya at
home. Everything a guy could ever
want, including NO kids.

Person_2
I'd love to have kids.

Person_1
What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!
Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes
you think Milo's gonna show up here?

Person_2
Logic. He knocked off all those banks.
He's got cash. He's gonna want to
spend it. This is one of the few
places that still takes cash. Sooner
or later... he's gotta turn up.

Person_1
And how we s'posed to recognize this
scumbag?

Person_2
The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you
see him... you'll know him.

Person_1
These are the best damn Nachos in
North America. Maybe the world!

Person_1
I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.
You want some?

Person_3
Got a light?

Person_2
Sure.

Person_3
How about a match?

Person_2
No thanks. I have plenty.

Person_3
You really are incredibly stupid,
aren't you? I like that in a man.

Person_2
I'd be insulted, but I know you're
serious.

Person_3
You sound so sure of yourself.

Person_2
I'm not as dumb as I look.

Person_3
Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...

Person_2
Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?

Person_3
Thirsty. What about that drink?

Person_2
I'm on duty.

Person_3
Brain surgeon?

Person_2
Cop.

Person_3
Oooo... and I bet you have a big
gun.

Person_2
You lose.

Person_3
If I can't buy you a drink...
...let me buy you one of those.

Person_2
Who can say no to a weiner?

Person_3
Not me.

Person_3
Two dogs. Hot.

Person_2
You come here often?

Person_3
Only when I'm in heat.

Person_2
Oh! Sorry.

Person_3
Where ya going?

Person_2
Get something to wipe it off.

Person_3
That's okay. You're doing just fine.

Person_2
I'll get you a wet paper towel.

Person_2
Hold it right there, Milo!

Person_4
Look out! He's got a weenie!

Person_2
Police emergency! I need your car!

Person_2
You take science in high school,
Milo?

Person_5
I skipped high school, cop!

Person_2
Then you're probably not familiar
with the theory of inverse
proportionate explosive dynamics.

Person_5
What about it?

Person_2
If you fire a weapon with the barrel
obstructed, the explosive force
multiplies by twenty-three point
five nine eight and reverses on itself
with diametric polarity?

Person_5
Yeah. So?

Person_2
The gun will blow up in your hand...
and it won't even scorch my pinkie.

Person_5
Ha! That's just theoretical
hypothesis. Inverse proportionate
explosive dynamics has never been
demonstrated conclusively in a
laboratory environment.

Person_2
Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart
guy. Let's find out.

Person_2
You have the right to remain silent...
next... if you waive that right,
anything you say... next...

Person_2
...may be used against you in a court
of law... next... You have the right
to an attorney... Do you have an
attorney?

Person_5
Nahhhh!

Person_2
Then today's your lucky day...

Person_6
Not bad for an auto mechanic...

Person_7
Yeah, well you're not so bad
yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

Person_6
Better watch your tongue, sweetie,
or I'll have my husband arrest you.

Person_7
Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When
does he ever find time for you?

Person_6
He doesn't. That's why I need you to
keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why
drive a jalopy when you can have a
hot rod?

Person_7
Maybe you should trade him in on a
new model.

Person_6
I would... if I could make any money
on the deal.

Person_7
Want to go for another test drive?

Person_6
Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm
still under warranty.

Person_2
Morning sweetheart.

Person_6
Uh huh. Want some coffee?

Person_2
No thanks.

Person_6
Frank here was just grabbing a little
before going back to work on my car.

Person_2
How long you been working on Lana's
Mercedes, Frank?

Person_7
Oh... I don't know... six, seven
weeks.

Person_2
And ya still haven't found the
problem?

Person_7
Think I got my finger on it though.

Person_2
I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't
born yesterday. He's not fixing your
car. He's SCREWING you!

Person_2
YOU are screwing my wife! I can see
what your game is, Frank. You open
up her hood, poke around in there...
squirt some lubrication in... play
around with all her parts... then
take an old used piston and stick it
in... then pull it out... in, out,
in, out! Every day! There's no end
to it. You just keep coming and
COMING!... and the bill just gets
bigger and BIGGER!

Person_2
But you don't see it, do you, Lana?
You're too good... too pure. You
can't see the evil in people like
him.
Well, you're not getting away with
it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're
fired!

Person_6
Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

Person_2
Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late
for court.

Person_2
You are so naive.

Person_2
Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

Person_7
Who's that?

Person_6
Just the postman. He always rings
twice.

Person_2
Laura... do you know where...?

Person_8
Right here. The judge decided to
skip arraignment and take Milo direct
to trial. You're six minutes late,
but don't sweat it. You got Judge
Allen. He's always eleven minutes
late.

Person_8
I suggest you try Lemming versus
Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped
in the water and everybody followed.

Person_2
Yeah. Good idea.

Person_2
I don't know what I'd do without
you?

Person_8
Really?

Person_2
Laura, how long have you worked for
me?

Person_8
Two years, seven months, twenty-three
days, nineteen hours...
...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.
...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-
five... fifty-six...

Person_2
And when was the last time I gave
you a raise?

Person_8
Never. But that's okay. I don't need
a raise. In fact... I was thinking
of giving you a rebate on my salary.

Person_2
Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

Person_8'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

Person_8'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

Person_2
Laura. Laura! What is it?

Person_8
I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a
bit... claustrophobic... in the
bathroom.

Person_2
Maybe we should try some prune juice.

Person_8
Wear the blue one.

Person_2
Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...
does this look like the face of a
crook?

Person_2
Of course it does. But the question
of my client's guilt or innocence is
not the issue here today. I'm certain
every member of the jury can clearly
see that he's guilty!

Side_1
I can't.

Person_2
Put yourself in his shoes. Look
through his eyes. See the world the
way HE sees it!

Person_2
Things just don't look the same.
It's fuzzy... and frightening!

Person_2
Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley
is not the perpetrator here. He is
the VICTIM!

Person_2
Like ALL of us... this man is the
unfortunate victim of these tragically
difficult economic times. And what
does that mean? He can't support his
family!

Person_2
For God's sake!... He can't even
support his own FACE!

Side_2
Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum
in my courtroom... unless you have
enough for everyone.

Side_2
Bailiff. Pass these out.

Side_2
And don't forget the jury.

Person_2
And so, desperate and broke, with no
other options before him, Mr. Crumley
went to eleven Savings & Loans and
did what any of you would have done.
He stole back the money that the
S&Ls had stolen from him!

Side_2
Mr. Ravine... please approach the
bench.

Side_2
You're not running for congress here,
so knock off the speeches and quit
inciting these brainless morons! Now
pick up the pace and wrap this son-
of-a-bitch up! Call your first
witness.

Person_2
I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

Side_3
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

Person_2
I do.

Person_2
Detective Ravine, at the time of the
arrest, did you read the defendant
his Miranda rights?

Person_2
Of course. That's standard procedure.

Person_2
Are these the cards Officer Brooks
used to prompt you while reading Mr.
Crumley his rights?

Person_2
Yeah. These are them.

Person_2
Reading from the cards now... quote
"You have the right to remain silent,
if you waive that right, anything
you say... may be used against you
in a court of law." Is that right?

Person_2
That's right.

Person_2
WRONG! The official Miranda warning
is... "anything you say CAN be used
against you in a court of law." Not
"may"... "CAN!"
Don't you know the difference between
"can" and "may", Detective? Every
school kid knows "can" is a verb
that indicates ability to perform,
while "may" is a verbal auxiliary
indicating the permission to act.

Person_2
I didn't have time to worry about
past participles or interrogative
pronouns! I was trying to protect
society from a deranged MADMAN!
But this ivy league fop...!!!

Person_2
I have no more use for this witness.

Side_2
Mr. Ravine...

Side_2
I'm dismissing this case on the
grounds of improper grammar.

Person_2
Ow!

Side_4
But your Honor...!

Side_2
I know, I know. It's a technicality.
But it's the kind of technicality
that makes the American legal system
what it is today! Court's adjourned!

Person_3
I waited. You never came back.

Person_2
I got busy. Here's that paper towel
I promised.

Person_3
Thanks...

Person_2
How'd you get in? The door was locked.

Person_3
It's miraculous what a real woman
can do... with a bobbie pin.

Person_3
Cigarette?

Person_2
No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

Person_3
Yes, I know. I like things that are
bad for me.
So... I hear you go both ways.

Person_2
Only once. It was a fraternity prank.
I never saw him again.

Person_3
No, I mean... you're a cop and a
lawyer.

Person_2
Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of
scum out there on the streets... but
they all deserve a fair and costly
trial.

Person_8
I'll get that.

Person_2
Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

Person_3
Lola Cain.

Person_3
So lovely to meet you, Laura.

Person_2
Gotta keep these darn books in their
right place or we'll never find the
ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...
R thru B... W thru F...

Person_8
It's getting late. I'll give you a
ride home, Ned.

Person_2
I have my car.

Person_8
I'll tow you.

Person_2
Not today. You don't need to wait.
I'll see you tomorrow.

Person_8
I should call someone to fix this...

Person_2
Tomorrow...

Person_8
I'll call from home.

Person_3
I think I should warn you, Mr.
Ravine... I'm not wearing any
underwear.

Person_2
Try these on.

Person_2
So... what can I do for you?

Person_3
I've run across some... papers...
and I thought you might be able to
tell me what they are. You see, I'm
not very experienced when it comes
to... papers.

Person_2
I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.
Do you have the... papers... here?

Person_3
No... they're at home. I thought you
might stop by...

Person_2
I'm on duty tonight.

Person_3
Don't they ever give you a night
off?

Person_2
Yeah. Tomorrow.

Person_3
Why don't we meet tomorrow evening
then?

Person_3
I'll let you know where.

Person_2
What's wrong with my office?

Person_3
Nothing a good interior decorator
couldn't fix.

Person_3
Take care of this for me, will ya?

Person_7
I came back for my shower cap.

Person_6
Yeah, well you came to the right
place.

Person_6
Sit down.

Person_7
Where is he?

Person_6
On duty all night. By the time he
wraps up his reports, it'll be close
to noon tomorrow.

Person_6
I was just reading over...

Person_6
Take off the hat, Frank.

Person_6
I was just reading over my husband's
insurance policies. You wouldn't
know anything about insurance, would
you, Frankie?

Person_7
Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies
part-time. I got half a brain... or
didn't you notice?

Person_6
I musta had my eye on something else.
How about a translation.

Person_7
Standard accident policy... all the
usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The
face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three
million bucks!
And there's a triple indemnity rider.

Person_6
Meaning?

Person_7
Aw, it's just something agents throw
in so we can boost the premium. If
the policy holder dies under very
specific conditions, it pays off
three times the face value of the
policy.

Person_6
Nine million dollars...?

Person_7
Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the
company. Nobody ever collects.

Person_6
Why not?

Person_7
Well, like here... it only pays off
if he's shot with a pistol, falls
from a moving northbound train and
drowns in a fresh water stream.

Person_6
All three?

Person_7
See what I mean, sweetheart? What
are the odds of that?

Person_6
It could happen.
Suppose it did happen?

Person_7
Then you'd be rich.

Person_6
Then we'd be rich.

Person_7
What're you sayin'...?

Person_6
We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!
And I know exactly how! He has a
legal symposium in Santa Barbara
this weekend... All we have to do is
get him to take the train up instead
of driving.

Person_7
How we gonna do that? Didn't you
tell me he hates trains?

Person_6
That's where you come in, baby. You're
gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.
That should be no problem for you.

Person_6
Then... we give him a lift to the
train station... through Dealey Plaza,
past the Book Suppository and around
the grassy knoll...

Person_7
Isn't that out of our way?

Person_6
Move, Frank.

Person_6
And pay attention.

Person_6
Ten minutes out of the station he'll
be standing in the vestibule between
cars... trying to avoid a panic
attack. Fourteen minutes and ten
seconds out, the train crosses the
Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen
minutes and fifty-four seconds, I
shoot him, shove him out the door...
he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!
A triple play. We're rich!

Person_7
You been thinking about this a lot,
haven't you?

Person_6
No. It just came to me.
I had this image of a big, powerful,
throbbing train... plunging into a
long, dark, wet tunnel.

Person_2
Stand over there and shut up!

Person_2
Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want
to hear language like that!

Person_1
Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.
You seem a little tense tonight.
What is it?

Person_2
Aw... I don't know. I guess it's
Lana. It's just... I know she wants
to have a baby so bad...

Person_2
...but I never get to spend any time
with her. And when I am home... it's
like she's, you know... avoiding
sex.

Person_2
That can't be it. I'm the tenderest
guy on the force. Nah... I think
she's just afraid she won't be able
to get pregnant.

Person_1
What's to be afraid! It's like making
breakfast! You bring home the bacon...
she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it
up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got
an omelette in the oven!
Why don't you knock off early... go
home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake
up in the morning and find you there
for a change.

Person_2
Naw... I can't. I got all this
paperwork.

Person_1
Don't worry about that.

Side_5
Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

Side_6
...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of
Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and
thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of
female! Smokes three cigars a day,
drinks a straight shot of vodka at
bedtime... and still has sex!

Person_2
Damn birds!

Person_8
My God, Ned... you look like you
were hit by a bus.

Person_2
I was.
Who's in my office?

Person_8
Max Shady's mother.

Person_2
Not again.

Person_2
Hello, Mrs. Shady.

Person_2
Laura... check on my insurance. Make
sure it's paid up.

Side_7
Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,
is getting out of prison tomorrow.

Person_2
Gee, has it been seven years already?

Side_7
Seven long, miserable years in the
slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

Person_2
Well, being locked in a tiny room
with no TV can make a guy feel pretty
tense.

Side_7
I'm very concerned about him, Mr.
Ravine. He said you were a two-bit
shyster... and he's going to rip
your head off and use it for a bowling
ball!

Person_2
I'm sure the experience wasn't all
negative. He probably made a lot of
friends...

Side_7
You think?

Person_2
...learned a useful trade...

Side_7
Oh yes... live autopsies...

Person_2
...caught up on all those books he
wanted to read...

Side_7
Maybe so... but he said he's going
to punch you in the testicles...

Side_7
...smash your face...

Side_7
...and decimate your wardrobe.

Side_7
And I wouldn't want that to happen.
He's a naughty naughty boy. I just
thought I should warn you.

Side_7
Bye for now.
Oh... may I have a cookie?

Person_8
Sure.

Side_7
Thank yooooooooou.

Person_8
Oh my God, Ned.

Person_2
I hate when she comes to see me.

Person_8
Don't you realize, Ned?... you could
be in real danger.

Person_2
What's that?

Person_8
Extreme peril. You know, the risk of
personal bodily harm.

Person_2
No... I mean that.

Person_8
Your insurance file. But the policy's
missing. Did you take it home?

Person_2
I don't think so.

Person_8
Oh, wait a second...

Person_8'S HUSBAND
Lau-raaaaa!

Person_2
Laura! Are you alright? That was a
very long flashback you had.

Person_8
Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a
little... pre-menstrual.

Person_8
That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped
by. She left this!

Person_2
Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked
me to take care of this.

Person_3
Thanks...

Person_2
You smoke too much.
It's hot tonight.

Person_3
Is it? I never know. My body heat
runs about twenty degrees above
normal.

Person_2
Maybe we should look for a cooler
place.

Person_3
I doubt we'll find one. Even the
wind chimes on my porch aren't moving
much these days. They keep thudding
softly, like dairy cows bumping butts
in the night. I go out there expecting
to find a cool breeze... but it's
just a lot of hot air.

Person_2
What're they lookin' at?

Person_3
A lot of them have tried that seat.
You're the first one's lasted this
long.

Person_2
I feel honored.

Person_3
Don't. It's broken.

Person_2
Did you bring the... papers?

Person_3
No. I thought you might come over...

Person_2
Sure. I'll drive you.

Person_3
I brought my own car.

Person_2
I'll follow you then.

Person_3
I know it sounds silly, but would
you leave first... wait in your car?
I come here a lot and I wouldn't
want those men to think I'm "easy"...
a slut who'll jump into bed with
anyone at the drop of a hat. But if
you leave first...

Person_2
...they'll think I'm a putz for
passing up a sure thing.

Person_3
Now leave me alone!

Person_2
Well, here we are... in the dark.

Person_3
I have The Clapper.

Person_2
You what?

Person_3
My wind chimes.

Person_2
You know, these would work a lot
better if you took them out of the
boxes.

Person_3
Well well... I guess you have been
around. I'm impressed.

Person_2
Why don't we take a look at those...
papers?

Person_3
Papers. Right.

Person_2
That's it? These are the... papers?

Person_3
Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can
you tell me what they are?

Person_2
This one's a laundry receipt... and
the other one's an expired lottery
ticket.

Person_3
No. You keep them... as a memento of
our time together.

Person_3
I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay
you for all you've done?

Person_2
Cash would be nice.

Person_3
Isn't there some other way?

Person_2
I suppose you could wash my car.

Person_3
No, I mean, isn't there something
else you want? Something I could
give you?

Person_2
Hey... slow down... there's a speed
limit in this state. Sixty-five miles
an hour.

Person_3
How fast was I going, officer?

Person_2
Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

Person_3
Suppose you pull me over and frisk
me?

Person_2
Suppose I let you off with a warning?

Person_3
Suppose I find a cop with a bigger
nightstick?

Person_2
Suppose I put you under arrest for
being a bad girl with bad thoughts?

Person_3
Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?

Person_2
Suppose I do and then we lose the
key and while I'm gone to get a
duplicate made the house catches on
fire and I can't get back to save
you because the bridge is washed out
and so you die a horrible death
toasted like a Polish sausage on a
flaming spit!
Nah... I better be going.

Person_3
You're not so tough. Last chance.

Person_2
No thanks. I got a cold shower and a
wife who trusts me waiting at home.

Person_3
What's the matter? Don't you want
me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

Person_2
Don't forget to lock up.

Person_3
I knew you'd come back...

Person_2
I forgot my car keys.

Person_3
That's not what you came back for.

Person_2
Yes it is.

Person_3
...don't... stop...

Person_3
...Oh Ned... please... don't...
stop...

Person_3
That takes care of foreplay.

Side_8
It's time, Max.

Side_9
Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off
and use it for a bowling ball!

Side_9
Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a
gift... to make up for losing my
case. Now I'm going to wear it to
his friggin' funeral!!

Side_9
Ma!

Person_2
That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

Person_3
Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

Person_2
Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it.

Person_3
It tells the sad story of a woman
who is rejected by her lover after a
brief, but torrid, affair... so she
stalks him with an ice pick and stabs
him with it more than a thousand
times.

Person_2
Really? I never could understand the
lyrics.

Person_2
You know, what happened last night
was very, uh...

Person_3
Yes... it was. I should check on my
homeowners insurance.

Person_2
But we can't ever let it happen again.
Ever!

Person_3
What are you saying, Ned? That you're
rejecting me, your lover, after a
brief, but torrid, affair?!

Person_2
I wouldn't put it exactly like that.
It's just that... well, I'm married
to a wonderful woman... who is very,
very attractive...
...not that you aren't very
attractive!

Person_2
...you aren't very attractive... you
aren't very attractive... you aren't
very attractive...

Side_10
Don't touch anything. You bond with
it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

Person_2
I'd like to buy a pet.

Side_10
Yeah. For what purpose?

Person_2
It's a gift... for my wife.

Side_10
Right. They all say that.

Person_2
She spends a lot of time alone. I
thought it might be nice if she had
something to keep her company.

Side_10
Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know
you're not the kind of guy who punches
out parakeets? Or takes some poor
defenseless animal, throws it in a
sack and runs over it with your car
five or six times.

Person_2
I would never hurt an animal.

Side_10
Boy, I would. They're driving me

Side_10
Shuddup!

Side_10
Okay... tell me more about this broad
you're married to. I like to match
people with the pets they deserve.

Person_1
Uh-uh.

Person_2
You do all my paperwork?

Person_2
Get out of here.

Person_1
And a damn good job, too. One of 'em
even did it in Spanish.

Person_1
Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

Person_1
Jesus... you hear that?

Person_2
He's just working through his anger,
trying to find a constructive outlet.

Person_1
Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The
guy's a friggin' looney!

Person_2
Trust me, I spent a lot of time with
him when I was preparing his case.
He's really a very sweet, sensitive
human being.

Side_11
I'd like to mash his head like a
ripe melon...

Person_2
He gets a little melon-dramatic.

Side_11
...then cut off all his fingers and
rip out his liver with my teeth!

Person_2
See. Loves to exaggerate.

Person_1
Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

Person_2
Lieutenant Ravine.

Person_3
I want to see you, Ned.

Person_2
I told you not to call me! It's
finished between us. No. No, I'm not
sucking anything of yours anymore!
It's done! OVER!

Person_2
Wrong number.

Person_7
How come we gotta meet here?

Person_6
We have to be careful now. We can't
risk being seen together at the house
or someone might connect us to the
murder later on.

Person_6
Here... put this on.

Person_6
Speak Yiddish.

Person_7
What?

Person_6
Red Yiddish.

Person_7
Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der

(I been thinkin'...
maybe this plan is
too complicated.)

Person_6
Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz

(Quit worrying. The
plan is perfect.)

Person_7
Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug.
Un schissen un schtippen in vasser

(Yeah, but we gotta
get him on the train,
shoot him... then
push him in the river.
There's a million
ways we can screw
up.)

Person_6
Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen

(You're not going
soft on me, are you?)

Person_7
Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke?
(When have I ever
gone soft on you?)

Person_6
Lest'n Yomkippur.

Person_7
Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie

(Okay... once! It
happens to every
guy.)

Person_7
Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures.
Me'vet unz chap'n.
(We're going to be in
big trouble. They're
going to catch us.)

Side_12
There's very little risk involved.
Statistics reveal that less than
thirty-two percent of all murderers
are ever apprehended.

Person_6
You speak Yiddish?

Side_12
No. But I can read sub-titles.

Side_13
Oy vay!

Person_8
Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

Person_2
I didn't. It's for my wife.

Person_8
She called. Wondered why you never
came home last night. I told her you
were working with a client,
undercover.

Person_8
Were you?

Person_2
What?

Person_8
There's lipstick on your collar.

Person_2
No there isn't.

Person_8
No... there isn't. But you answered
my question. She's a real looker,
huh?

Person_2
Who?

Person_8
Lola Cain.

Person_2
I hadn't noticed.

Person_8
Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't
noticed.
That's alright. She noticed enough
for both of us.

Person_8
I worry about you, Ned. I worry a
lot.
Max Shady's been faxing death threats
to you all morning.

Person_2
...stick a knife in your...
...rip the eyeballs out of your...
...drive razor-sharp spikes under
your...

Person_8
Did you get to the one...?

Person_2
...cut it off... shove it in a
blender.

Person_8
Yeah... that one.

Person_2
He's just getting it out of his
system. Once they say it... they
never do it. You know... like the
President.

Person_8
Wait. It might be him.

Person_2
Where did you get that?

Person_8
From my purse.

Person_2
What are you doing with it?

Person_8
Handing it to you.

Person_2
Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun
for?

Person_8
You shoot it. A bullet comes out.
Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a
cop, I'd think you'd know these
things.

Person_2
Laura... put the gun away.

Side_14
Flowers for Ned Rav...
Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?
Man, you are dead meat!

Person_8
Is this another sick joke from Max
Shady?

Person_2
What is it...?

Person_8
Lola Cain.

Person_8
I'll put these in water for you.

Person_3'S VOICE
Ned, darling... I know this seems
like a strange way to talk with you...
but since you won't take my calls, I
have no other choice.
Watch it! That red car's turning
left!

Person_3'S VOICE
I love you, Ned. We're meant to be
together... forever.
The light's changing! Floor it! Go!
Go! Go!

Person_3'S VOICE
Nice move!
Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not
even your wife. I'd hate to have to
tell her about us, but if necessary...
I will.

Person_6
What happened to you last night?

Person_2
Why? What have you heard?

Person_6
You could have called. But then, I
suppose you were tied up.

Person_2
Only part of the time.

Person_6
I never know when you're coming home,
Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

Person_2
I promise I'll spend more time with
you. I know it's been rough, being
alone so much. But I'll make it up
to you. Maybe we should try again,
you know... to have a baby.

Person_6
So what's in the box?

Person_2
Oh... I brought you a present!

Person_6
What is it?

Person_2
It's... sorta like a cat.

Person_6
Not enough like a cat.

Person_2
It's a little skunk. I got it at
Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

Person_2
So... what're you going to name him?

Person_6
How about... Ned?

Person_2
Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've
always liked the name Ned.

Person_6
No kidding.

Person_2
So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior
as much as you love me?

Person_6
At least.

Person_6
Hello?... Hello?... Hello?
Frank? Is that you?

Person_6
I told you not to call. Frank? FRANK!

Person_3
Who's Frank?

Person_2
Frank? The only Frank I know is an
auto mechanic... but I sure as hell
wouldn't recommend the guy. He's
really slow.

Person_3
I had to see you, Ned. I need to
feel your arms around me! I wanna
suck your toes til the nails pop
off!

Person_2
I told you, what happened was a big
mistake. A one night stand. It's
over. I have a wife...

Person_3
It doesn't matter. She'll know all
about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In
my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

Person_3
I got us tickets to see Iron
Butterfly!

Person_2
I hate opera!

Person_3
Why are you running from me? Didn't
it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing
my buns with carnuba wax?
Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey
want to go exploring?

Person_2
He's busy right now.

Person_2
Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a
big mistake! One lousy mistake in
his whole stinkin' life! So why don't
you give him a BREAK! Besides... he
belongs to my wife!

Side_16
I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey
for setting yet another unusual legal
precedent. This is the first time
I've ever tried a case in which the
JURY was found to be insane.

Side_3
What're you? A thirty-eight long?

Side_16
The jury will be remanded to the
Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi
Valley. Court's adjourned.

Person_2
Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you
tell me?

Person_8
It's not important. I just had one
last year.

Person_2
Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

Person_8
Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll
have another one sometime.

Person_2
I insist. And I want to get you a
nice present.

Person_8
You're so sweet. You don't have to.
You gave me a present last year.
Those lovely Ginzu knives.

Person_2
Yeah... aren't they great! They last
forever. And you can cut right through
a shoe with 'em!

Person_2
It's nice to be off the streets...
away from all the pain and misery
out there.

Person_8
Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind
you about...

Person_2
...the Legal Symposium...

Person_8
...in Santa Barbara...

Person_2
...tomorrow...

Person_2 & LAURA
..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."

Person_2
Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

Person_8
What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

Person_2
I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel
passion at one time or another. Even
me.

Person_8
Really?

Person_2
What would you think of a married
man who gave in to those wild,
sensual, raging desires?

Person_8
Oh... wow... golly...

Person_2
What if, for just one crazy moment,
he couldn't resist...? He got knocked
for a loop and lost control?

Person_8
Gosh... that might be okay.

Person_2
What if a tidal wave of lust crashed
over him and he was sucked into a
vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

Person_2
Well... it's not your problem. I'll
work it out.

Person_3
Like some ice for your drink?

Person_3
Does your wife know you're...
"working" late? I certainly hope so,
Mr. Ravine.

Person_6
Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

Person_7
It's all taken care of. When do I
knock on the door?

Person_6
Wait until I signal you. When I raise
the blinds... you knock.

Person_6
Not now!

Person_7
Oh, later... right... okay.

Person_6
Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-
bye to Little Ned. He loves his
daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

Person_2
See you tonight, Junior.

Person_6
What's wrong?

Person_2
This neighborhood is getting worse
all the time! Damn kids stole my
engine!

Person_6
Why don't you catch the train to
Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty
minutes.

Person_2
I'll just fly up.

Person_6
No!

Person_6
I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists
seized the airport this morning. A
plane crashed into the tower... and
all the runways are on fire!

Person_2
Yeah. So?

Person_6
And it's fogged in.

Person_2
Dammit.

Person_6
For my peace of mind... take the
train.

Person_2
I can't do it. You know how I feel
about riding trains.

Person_6
Darling... it's only a short trip.

Person_2
Yeah... right. A short trip.

Person_2
A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

Person_6
Just because both your parents died
in a train wreck...

Person_2
And my brother, Jeff...

Person_6
And your brother, Morty...

Person_2
My two sisters...

Person_6
Right...

Person_2
My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...
Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.
All killed by trains!

Person_6
Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's
the past. They're gone.

Person_2
Yeah. I guess I can't bring them
back by not riding on a train.

Person_6
That's right.

Person_2
But I just can't get over this stupid
nagging fear that...

Person_6
Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I
don't want to raise a child in a
home filled with fear!

Person_6
But if you can conquer your fear...
maybe I can conquer my fear of having
a baby with a father who's fearful.
Ned... don't let a train kill our
child before it's even conceived!

Person_2
I guess you're right.

Person_6
You're sure now...?

Person_2
But we'll never make it to the
station. By the time a cab gets
here...

Person_7
I was in the neighborhood. Thought
I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

Person_6
Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

Person_7
Sure, I'll take you to the train
station.

Person_2
Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

Person_2
We're not going to make it.

Person_7
We'll make it!

Person_6
Okay... now what're you going to do
if you feel queasy going through the
tunnel?

Person_2
I'll stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

Person_6
That's right. When you get queasy...
go stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

Side_18
OH! My dear gracious!

Side_19
SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish
that foul smelling cigar?

Side_11
You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU
want me to put out my cigar? You
want ME to put out my CIGAR?

Side_19
Yeah.

Side_11
Certainly.

Person_6
It's already getting to him. He'll
be out of that seat and into the
vestibule within ten minutes... I
guarantee it.

Side_11
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to
ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

Side_20
Ticket?

Side_20
Sorry pal... automatic weapons are
only allowed in the club car after
nine p.m.

Side_20
I'll check it with baggage. You can
claim it at the depot in Santa
Barbara.

Side_21
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?
No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?
My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really
neat. Everybody gets creamed! All
bloody guts... heads ripped off and
stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song
"Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy
Gopher Guts"?

Person_6
You want to earn a couple bucks,
kid?

Side_21
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?

Person_6
He's losing it. You better get up to
the next car. Remember, give me the
high sign as soon as you see the
river. It'll be two minutes and nine
seconds past the tunnel. I'll take
care of the rest. Anything goes
wrong... just make sure you back me
up.
And don't let him see you.

Person_2
This... is not a toy!

Side_21
Yes it is.

Side_11
Here... let me help you with that.

Side_22
What a nice young man. You are so
polite.

Side_11
I try to be.

Side_21
Great green gobs of greasy, grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... chopped up dirty birdie's
feet... one pint jar of all-purpose
porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan
stew.

Side_21
French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs
you wanna pick... stuff to make your
mother sick... dog poop on a stick...
puke and snot all mixed together in
a pot...

Side_21
Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

Person_6
Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

Side_11
You shootin' at me?

Side_11
Yeah... you're definitely shootin'
at me.

Person_2
In this crazy world, there's not a
whole lot a guy can count on. But
when the chips are down, I can always
count on you.

Person_2
You risked your life to save mine. A
guy can't ask any more from a woman
than that.

Person_2
But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In
cold blood. I gotta arrest you for
murder.

Person_6
Ned... you wouldn't...

Person_2
Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to
do.

Person_6
But... you said it yourself. I saved
your life.

Person_2
Don't worry, baby. I know a good
lawyer.

Person_2
That's a question for the arresting
officer.

Person_2
You'll have to ask her attorney.

Person_2
Only her husband can answer that.

Person_2
A lovely powder blue dress with a
cinch waist, full bodice and a
delicately pleated skirt.

Person_2
No comment.

Person_2
I said... NO COMMENT!

Person_2
Jeez... they're really throwing some
tough questions out there today.

Person_8
They're just doing their job.

Person_2
Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech
lynching of an uppity white
housewife."

Person_2
What's this?

Person_1
Only cell available. They had that
serial killer locked up here... you
know, the one who talks his victims
to death then eats them... Hannibal
the Lecturer. But they let him out
for a three week tour to publicize
his new book.

Person_2
"To Serve Man."

Person_1
It's a cookbook.

Person_1
And look, look... he autographed it.

Person_2
To Arch... Love to have you for dinner
sometime... Hannibal.
Very nice.

Person_1
They're waiting for ya. They didn't
want to start without her attorney
being present.

Person_6
PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could
use a good exterminator.

Person_6
Can't you get me out of this cage,
Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.

Person_2
Judge said no bail. Don't worry.
Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

Person_2
Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

Side_23
It's your collar... your bust...
your call... your show... your play...
your move... your wife...

Person_2
Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

Side_24
Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup
allowed in this building.

Person_6
What're you gonna do... arrest me
for primping?

Person_2
Don't give us a tough time. Just
spill it! What were you doing on
that train?

Person_6
Well...

Person_2
As your attorney, I must advise you...
you don't have to answer that
question.

Person_2
Alright, quit playing games with us!
Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get
the gun? What's your link with the

Person_2
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I
will not tolerate this unwarranted
badgering of my client. She'll have
her day in court, gentlemen.

Person_2
I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine,
for being so cooperative with these
gentlemen.
Did you get all that down, Laura.
Every word she said?

Person_8
Yep. Both of 'em.

Person_3
Yes.

Person_3
Yes!

Person_2
NOOOOOOOooooooo!!!

Person_3
YES! Cappelini pomodoro!

Person_2
What?

Person_3
Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta?
You don't like Italian?

Person_2
Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?!

Person_3
I thought he might like to get out,
so I took him to the amusement park.

Person_2
You can't just break into my house,
cook my food... borrow my skunk!
Leave me alone. Stay out of my face!
Out of my neighborhood! Out of my

Person_3
You haven't seen the last of me,
Ned.

Person_3
I told you.

Side_25
Lana, Lana, she's the one Shot a bad
guy with a gun Blew that sucker off
a train Some guys are a friggin'
pain YaaaaaAAAAAAAAY LANA!

Side_26
Once again, Americans are making a
mockery of their courts, turning a
murder trial into a media circus!
How can justice ever prevail when it
is ridiculed and reviled in such a
heinously revolting manner? This is
Clement Von Franckenstein returning
you to our BBC studios in London for
the latest photographs of Lady Di
naked in the bath.

Side_27
What a great day for a trial! We
have lots of incandescent lighting,
seventy-two degrees inside... and no
wind!

Side_3
Oy vay! Oy vay! Superior Court of
Los Angeles is now in session. And
here he is... direct from a triumphant
one-week engagement in Las Vegas
Circuit Court... the honorable...
the venerable... the totally
irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan-
kyyyyyyy!

Side_27
Wow... has this defense team been
HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories
this year! Let's go down for the
coin toss.

Side_4
...the prosecution will prove that
this repulsive and degenerate woman
coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding
citizen...

Person_2
Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay,
irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca-
doody poo-poo...

Side_28
Sustained.

Person_2
And can you tell us what this is?

Person_8
Yes. It's a death threat that Max
Shady FAXED to you on the day he was
released from prison.

Person_2
A FAX in which he threatened to puree
certain parts of my anatomy in a
blender! I'd like to submit this
into evidence.

Side_4
Objection! Who cares about the FAX
in this case?

Side_28
I'll allow it.

Side_25
U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!
You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-
M-A! How you think you got that way?
Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!

Person_2
And is this the blender you found in
the lavatory of the train?

Side_20
Yes... it is.

Person_2
I'd like this marked as evidence.

Side_27
Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's
check out the re-play.

Side_27
Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide
open! But instead of handing it off,
Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh!
The pass is wide! A real wobbler!
There's no way! He scrambles, but he
just can't get his hands on it...
And RIGHT THERE!...
...WHAM! That blender is gone!

Person_8
Ned... did you ever consider that
maybe you don't know women as well
as you think you do?

Person_2
I'm really worried about this guy.
He could blow our whole case right
out of the water.

Side_21
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet...
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

Side_21
That lady paid me two bucks to sing
it to him...!

Side_28
Recess! Ten minutes!

Side_4
Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha!

Person_8
No you didn't!

Person_2
No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!

Side_3
Recess is over! Let's go... move it,
move it, move it!

Side_27
There they go... the UCLA Marching
Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it
looks like the victim's mother...
Helen Shady... is gonna take the
stand! This will be the first
defensive play of the afternoon.

Person_2
Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about
your son, Max. Was he a... a good
boy?

Side_7
He was the best. And that's not just
a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

Person_2
But he got into trouble once in
awhile... like all kids do?

Side_7
Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes
and things. But he was so cute. I
have pictures!

Side_7
Here. This is when he set the cat on
fire...
Oh... but the cat deserved it.

Person_2
And what, uh... what are these...?

Side_7
Marshmallows. He just loved to toast
marshmallows over a roaring cat.
Burned on the outside... all soft in
the middle.
And right here... this was taken on
the day he left the priesthood to
join the Green Berets.

Person_2
This is cute.

Side_7
Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux
Klan phase. He would take the sheets
right off my bed... cut those little
holes in them. What a stitch he was!

Person_2
And is this Max... with all the
tools... fixing his bike?

Side_7
Why that shouldn't even be in there!
It's his rotten little half-brother.
Stinkin' little pecker... he never
was any good...

Side_7
Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi
boys. They were all so fussy and
persnickety about everything. Heil
this and heil that.
Oh look... here's Max with his
chainsaw. He loved to go to the
national park and cut down those
giant old trees. It made him feel so
patriotic. You know, if he hadn't
been such a successful criminal... I
think he would have been a lumberjack.

Side_7
But now he'll never be anything! Not
since...
...that woman, your wife, pulled the
trigger and put my little Max in his
grave!

Side_28
Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger
in my courtroom. It's discourteous,
impolite and disrespectful.

Side_7
Don't you tell me what to do with my
finger! It's been more places than
you've ever dreamed of!

Side_28
Sit down!

Side_7
I'll point my finger wherever I want!

Person_2
Did you encounter the victim... Max
Shady... on board the train?

Side_19
Yeah. And I told him... "this is the
NO SMOKING car! Would you please put
out your damn cigar!"

Person_2
And is that the cigar in your ear?

Side_19
I believe it is.

Person_2
I'd like the cigar and the head of
this witness entered into evidence.

Person_2
The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

Side_3
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth
so help you God?

Person_6
Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

Side_28
No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

Person_2
Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you
Lana?

Person_6
No. Call me Angel Tits.

Side_4
I object!

Side_28
Sustained. Counselor... you will
address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

Person_2
Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell
the court... what were you doing on
that train?

Person_6
I saw Max Shady at the station...
saw him get on board. I knew he'd
made threats to kill you and mutilate
your reproductive organs...

Person_6
...so I got on the train too... so I
could warn you.

Person_2
Do you want to have children?

Person_6
Someday. With the right man.

Person_2
But you couldn't have children if
my...
...were...
...and, uh...

Person_6
It would be difficult.

Person_2
So you followed him, knowing you had
to protect me... your husband...
your best friend... the man you
love... the future father of your
children.

Person_6
Something like that.

Person_2
And when you saw that maniac standing
in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize
my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and
fired and fired and FIRED!

Person_6
And fired and fired and fired and
fired and fired and fired and fired...

Person_6
...and fired and fired and fired.

Person_2
The defense rests, your Honor.

Person_2
How can you convict a courageous
woman who risked everything to save
the life of her beloved husband? A
woman who acted boldly to stop a
demented maniac from doing THIS!...

Person_2
...pulverizing the private parts of
the man she loves!

Person_2
Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the
potential mother of my potential
child. I challenge YOU to strike a
blow for motherhood and the American
justice system! Put the "con" back
in the Constitution. Put the "ju"
back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"
back in American. And put the "dom"
back in freedom. Find this woman
INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed
happy tonight!

Side_29
The jury's back!

Side_28
So... has the jury reached a verdict?

Side_30
Yes we have, your Honor.

Side_28
How do you find the defendant... on
the count of manslaughter?

Side_30
Not guilty.

Side_28
On the count of murder in the first
degree?

Side_30
Not guilty.

Side_28
On the Count of Monte Cristo?

Side_30
Not guilty.

Side_28
Good. Then on the count of three,
let's all get the hell out of here!
One... two...

Side_28
Wait... for... it...

Side_28
Two and a half... THREE!

Person_6
Well, counselor, looks like you won
another case. Lucky for me.

Side_31
I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars
is bad for your hearing!

Side_32
Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

Person_6
How much for my gun?

Person_8
I don't believe it! She just bought
her gun back! The gun she used to
kill a man!

Person_2
Yeah... the same gun that saved my
life. I'm sure it has sentimental
value.

Person_7
So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

Person_6
No thanks to you.

Person_7
Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

Person_6
You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You
let me take all the heat.

Person_7
Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

Person_6
You were gonna let me rot in the
slammer... never say a thing.

Person_7
Look... you're out... free. Now we're
together. That's what counts. We can
try again! Forget triple indemnity.
We'll whack him and split three mil.

Person_6
I'm not splitting anything, Frank.
And you know too much.

Person_7
Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot
me.

Person_6
You're right.
Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

Person_7
Now you're talkin' baby.

Side_33
Watch your step, guys. There's a lot
of blood.

Side_34
Looks like a suicide. We found a
note.

Side_34
It was stuck up his nose.

Person_1
"I can't take it anymore. I'm a
mediocre mechanic... and a lousy
lover."

Person_2
He's sure got that right.

Person_2
The "mechanic" part, I mean.

Person_2
I don't know why, Arch, but I just
can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't
suicide.

Person_6
Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

Person_2
Um? She told you her name was Um?
And what other lies did she tell
you? I've never seen this woman in
my life! Never followed her home!
Never had sex with her in the
refrigerator! It's all a sick
fantasy... and I deny everything!

Person_2
When will women like you learn, you
can't tear apart a perfectly good
marriage with your vicious lies...
Miss UMMMM!

Person_3
Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.
I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.
The big powerful kind that suck up
everything in sight. I was just
telling your wife, if she wants to
get rid of all her dirt, she has to
be willing to pay the price.

Person_3
Let me know what you decide, Mrs.
Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a
convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure
meeting you... Ned.

Person_6
I... hate... SALESMEN!

Person_2
I know it's been a tough ordeal...
with the trial and everything. Tell
you what... let's take a trip.

Person_6
A trip?

Person_2
Yeah. Just the two of us.

Person_6
I like that. Just you and me... all
alone. I'll start packing.

Person_2
Great. Listen... I got something to
take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

Person_3
Who is it?

Person_2
I just want to talk.

Person_3
Why didn't you say so?

Person_3
Would you like a drink?

Person_2
No thanks. I'm driving.

Person_3
Then let's get to the point!

Person_3
So what's your problem, tough guy?

Person_2
Stay away from my life, my wife, my
home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on
a vacation and when I come back, I
don't ever want to see your face
again!

Person_3
A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a
VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!
She always was and always will be!

Person_2
What are you talking about? You don't
know anything about Lana?

Person_3
I know EVERYTHING!

Person_2
How do you know her? Who is she to
you? TELL ME!

Person_2
Who is she!

Person_3
She's your wife!

Person_2
Who is she!?

Person_3
She's my sister!

Person_2
Liar! Who is she?

Person_3
She's your wife!

Person_3
She's my sister!

Person_3
She's your wife... AND my sister!

Person_3
She was spoiled rotten! She stole
everything I ever had. Everything!
Including him.

Person_2
Him? Who, him?

Person_3
Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He
was older. So mature... so strong.
He smelled like dirty sweat socks
and old basketballs. And he was all
mine. For awhile.
But Lana wasn't satisfied with her
own things. She had to have mine
too. She took it all... my makeup,
my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

Person_2
You wore the same clothes?

Person_3
We were identical twins.

Person_2
What're you talking about? You two
don't look anything alike.

Person_3
Not anymore. One day I caught her
stealing my lavender eye shadow and
she smashed my face in with a shovel.
I had fifty-three operations. When
the doctors were finished with me...
I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!

Person_2
You're beautiful.

Person_3
Don't lie to me.

Person_2
They did a terrific job!

Person_3
I look in the mirror. I can SEE!

Person_2
But... you're gorgeous!

Person_3
Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my
face, he left me for HER... because
she looked more like me than I did!
First she stole my looks... then she
stole the only man who ever loved
me!

Person_3
But I found a way to get even. The
best revenge possible. Destroy her
marriage!

Person_2
That's why you did all this? Seduced
me... harrassed me... the tape...
the flowers... the phone calls...

Person_3
You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,
haven't ya?

Person_2
It won't work. Lana loves me.

Person_3
It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing
her for everything she's worth. She
murdered that greasy auto mechanic.
I saw her do it.

Person_2
Lana killed Frank Kelbo?

Person_3
Kelbo! His name was Kelbo?

Person_2
Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car
repairs too?

Person_3
Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a
son. Frankie Kelbo.

Person_2
Lana?

Person_8
Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so
much to tell you.

Person_2
Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab
a chair.

Person_8
Thanks... I brought my own.

Person_2
So... what have you got?

Person_8
A lottery ticket and a laundry
receipt.
I found them in the pocket of that
suit you wore the night you were
working under cover with a client.

Person_8
You remember that night, don't ya
Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts
with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
O... L-A. Lola.

Person_8
Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's
mind works.

Person_2
How about Ovaltine?

Person_8
Fine. Then I remembered you told me
some guy named Frank had been working
on your wife's car for two months.
You with me so far?

Person_2
I'm way ahead of you.

Person_8
Well back it up. You probably took a
wrong turn. Remember your insurance
policy... the one we couldn't find?
I started thinking, who else had
access to it beside you and me? The
answer came up... Lana. And since
she's a woman, it's probably hidden
right here.

Person_2
So that's where she hid the Oreos.

Person_8
Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your
life when she shot Max Shady. She
and Frank were plotting to kill you
and collect on your insurance policy.
But she shot the wrong guy.

Person_2
That's the craziest thing I ever
heard.

Person_8
Don't you see... Frank was going to
let her take the fall. So she murdered
him and tried to make it look like
suicide.
That's when I realized there was a
connection between Lola and Lana...

Person_2
Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

Person_8
Well, hang on to your jock strap,
Ned. There's more.

Person_8
Not only is Frank's father Dwayne
Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher
and Lola Cain's former lover...
Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max
and Frank are half-brothers who never
met.

Person_8
Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered
both of Helen Shady's sons.

Person_2
This is so unbelievable.

Person_8
And you haven't even heard my story.

Person_8
He turned into a monster. And that's
when I left him. I just couldn't...

Person_2
That damn faucet keeps turning on
all by itself. I'll go check it.

Person_8
Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

Side_35
I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a
gig tonight.

Person_8'S HUSBAND
Forget something, sweetheart?

Person_8'S HUSBAND
You forgot to flush, darling.

Person_3
What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me
away?

Person_8
I never forget anything... honey.

Person_8
Those are MY panties!

Person_8
Oh Ned!

Person_2
You were right... there's a million
things I don't know about women.
Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

Person_2
Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

Person_8
Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved
you!

Person_8
Got 'em!

Person_2
Person_8
I said... I GOT 'EM!

Person_8
Person_2
Person_8
Okay. But I want to have kids.

Person_2
Great.

Person_2
...understand women... give birth...
and program a VCR. And giving birth
is the easy one.

Person_8
Ned...

Person_2
Yeah, Laura?

Person_8
Knock off the chatter, will ya?

Person_8
We won't need you anymore.

Person_8
We can make our own music.

Person_1
The Bengal tiger, extinct for over a
century, is making a comeback. These
cloned tiger cubs at the Beijing Zoo
are...

Person_2
I hope you realize you've just lost a
customer!

Person_2
Candy ass bitch.

Person_2
If it ain't rainin' we ain't trainin'!

Person_3
Are you Jake Sully?

Person_2
Step off.    You're ruinin' my good mood.

Person_4
It's about your brother.

Person_2
Jesus, Tommy.

Person_3
Your brother represented a significant
investment. We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

Person_2
Are we there?

Person_5
We're there, Sunshine.

Person_5
People, you have been in cryo for five
years, nine months and twenty two days.
You will be hungry, you will be weak. If
you feel nausea, please use the sacks
provided for your convenience. The staff
thanks you in advance.

Person_6
Exopacks on!

Person_6
Remember people, you lose your mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds and
you're dead in four minutes. Let's nobody
be dead today, it looks bad on my report.

Person_6
Exopack on, let's go!

Person_6
Go directly into the base! Do not stop!
Go straight inside!

Person_7
Look at all that new meat.

Person_8
Check it out, man.    Meals on wheels.

Person_7
That is just wrong.

Person_2
What're you two limpdicks starin' at?

Person_7
Seen a lotta guys leave this place in a
wheelchair. Never seen anybody show up
in one.

Person_9
... You are on Pandora, ladies and
gentlemen. Respect that fact every second
of every day.

Person_9
Out beyond that fence every living thing
that crawls, flies or squats in the mud
wants to kill you and eat your eyes for
jujubees.

Person_9
We have an indigenous population of
humanoids here called the Na'vi. They're
fond of arrows dipped in a neurotoxin
which can stop your heart in one minute.
We operate -- we live -- at a constant
threat condition yellow.

Person_9
As head of security, it's my job to keep
you alive.    I will not succeed --
-- not with all of you. If you wish to
survive, you need a strong mental
attitude, you need to follow procedure...

Side_1
Hey, you're Jake right? Tom's brother?
You look just like him.
Sorry, I'm Norm Spellman, I went through
avatar training with him.

Side_1
He was a great guy -- funny.     It was a
big shock to all of us.

Person_2
Yeah.

Side_1
And duh! -- obviously you look like him.
I mean, if you weren't genetically
identical, you wouldn't be taking over
his avatar.

Person_2
That's why I'm here.

Side_1
So -- you want to go check it out?

Side_2
Me and Norm were out here to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called
avatars. They're grown from human DNA
mixed with DNA from the natives here.

Person_2
Damn.   They got big.

Side_1
Yeah, they mature on the trip out.
So the proprioceptive sims worked pretty
well.

Side_2
Yeah, they've got great muscle tone. Give
us a few hours, you guys can take them
for a spin.

Person_2
It looks like him.

Side_1
No, it looks like you.   This is your
avatar now, Jake.

Person_2
-- so their nervous systems are in tune.
Or something. Which is why they offered
me this gig, because I can link with
Tommy's avatar, which was insanely
expensive.
Is this right? I just say whatever in
these videologs?

Side_1
Yeah. You just need to get in the habit
of documenting everything -- what you
see, what you feel -- it's all part of
the science. Good science starts with
good observation.

Person_2
Right.
So, whatever. Here I am. Doing science.
Never been in a lab before.

Side_2
Log off. It's time to meet your boss for
the next five years.

Side_1
Grace Augustine is a legend. She's the
head of the Avatar Program, and she wrote
the book -- I mean literally wrote the
book -- on Pandoran botany.

Side_2
That's because she likes plants better
than people.

Side_2
And here she is, Cinderella back from the
ball. Grace, I'd like you to meet Norm
Spellman and Ja --

Side_3
Norm. I hear good things about you.
How's your Na'vi?

Side_1
May the All Mother smile upon our first
meeting.

Side_2
Uh, Grace, this is Jake S----

Side_3
Yeah, yeah, I know who you are, and I
don't need you. I need your brother.
You know -- the PhD who trained three
years for this mission.

Person_2
He's dead. I know it's a big
inconvenience to everyone.

Side_3
How much lab training have you had?   Ever
run a gas chromatograph?

Person_2
No.

Side_3
Any actual lab work at all?

Person_2
High school chemistry.   But I ditched.

Side_3
You see? You see? They're pissing on us
without even the courtesy of calling it
rain.
I'm going to Selfridge.

Side_2
Grace, that's not a good idea.

Side_2
Here, tomorrow, oh eight hundred.   Try to
use big words.

Side_3
Parker, I used to think it was benign
neglect, but now I see you're
intentionally screwing us.

Side_4
Grace.   You know I enjoy our little
talks.

Side_3
I need a research assistant, not some
jarhead dropout.

Side_4
Actually, we got lucky with him.

Side_3
Lucky?   How is this in any way lucky?

Side_4
Well -- lucky your guy had a twin
brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an
oral hygienist or something. A Marine we
can use. I'm assigning him to your team
as security escort.

Side_3
The last thing I need is another trigger
happy asshole out there!

Side_4
Look, you're supposed to be winning the
hearts and minds of the natives. Isn't
that the whole point of your little
puppet show? If you look like them, if
you talk like them, they'll trust you?

Side_4
But after -- how many years? -- relations
with the indigenous are only getting
worse.

Side_3
That tends to happen when you use machine
guns on them.

Side_4
This is why we're here. Unobtanium.
Because this little gray rock sells for
twenty million a kilo. No other reason.
This is what pays for the party. And
it's what pays for your science.
Comprendo?

Side_4
Those savages are threatening our whole
operation. We're on the brink of war and
you're supposed to be finding a
diplomatic solution. So use what you've
got and get me some results.

Side_3
How much link time have you logged?

Side_1
Five hundred and twenty hours.

Person_2
Like -- an hour.

Side_3
Tell me you're joking.

Person_2
Don't!   I got this.

Side_3
So you just figured you'd come out here
to the most hostile environment known to
man, with no training of any kind, and
see how it went? What was going through
your head?

Person_2
Maybe I was just tired of doctors telling
me what I couldn't do.

Side_3
Relax and let your mind go blank.    That
shouldn't be hard for you.

Person_2
Kiss the darkest part of my lily white --

Side_2
Initiate link.

Side_2
That's a gorgeous brain.     Nice activity.

Side_3
Go figure.
Alright, I'm going in.

Side_5
Phase-lock at forty percent.    He's in
transition.

Side_2
That's it.     Find your way home.

Side_2
He's in.

Side_5
Phase-lock ninety nine percent. The link
is stable.

Side_2
Take it slow, Jake. We need to check
your motor control. Try touching your
fingertips together --

Person_5
Easy, Jake, I need you to sit down --

Side_2
Jake! Wait, we have to run some tests --

Person_2
Grace?

Side_3
Well who'd you expect, numbnuts?   Think
fast!

Side_3
Motor control is looking good.

Side_1
I am a living god.

Person_9
For you pogues, this is a banshee. A
small one. See, they like it when I
bring fresh meat out here. And this
clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's
nest. So keep your head on a swivel. If
it moves, shoot it. If you're not sure
it's moving -- shoot it! If it looks like
a bunch of flowers you want to take home
to Sally Rottencrotch -- SHOOT IT!
What're you gonna do?

Side_6
Shoot it, sir!

Person_9
Outstanding. Let's roll.

Person_2
That's kinda freaky.

Side_3
Lights out amigos.     See ya' at dinner.

Side_3
Damn. Same old sack a' bones.

Side_7
Sully -- Colonel wants to see you in the
Armor Bay.

Person_2
You guys're packing some heavy ordinance.

Side_7
Yeah, `cause we're not the only thing
flyin' around out there. Or the biggest.
I'm gonna need you on a door gun, I'm a
man short.

Person_2
Yeah, no problem.

Side_7
See ya on the flight-line, zero nine.
He's down there.

Person_9
This low gravity makes you soft.
You get soft, Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.

Person_9
I pulled your record, Corporal. Venezuela
-- that was some mean bush. Nothing like
this here, though. You got heart kid,
coming out here.

Person_2
I figured -- just another hellhole.

Side_8
That servo's in, Colonel, if you want to
try it.

Person_9
I was in First Recon a few years ahead of
you. More than a few. Two tours in
Nigeria, not a scratch. I come out here
and --

Person_9
They could fix this if I rotated back.
But you know what? I kinda like it.
Reminds me every day what's out there.
Besides, I can't leave --

Person_9
This is my war, here.

Person_9
The avatar program is a joke -- buncha
limpdick scientists. But we have a
unique opportunity here, you and I. A
recon Marine in an avatar body could get
me the intel I need, on the ground, right
in the hostiles' camp.

Person_9
Looks good.
I need you to learn about these savages,
gain their trust. Find out how I can
force their cooperation, or hit `em hard
if they don't. Maybe you can keep some
of my boys from going home like you. Or
bagged-and-tagged.

Person_9
On paper. You walk like one of her
science pukes, you quack like one, but
you report to me. Can you do that for
me?

Person_9
Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get
me what I need, I'll see you get your
legs back when you rotate home. Your real
legs.

Side_3
Start calibrating. We're on the flight
line in ten minutes.

Side_3
What did Atilla want?

Person_2
Just Marines comparin' tattoos.

Side_3
Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine --

Side_3
-- you're driving an avatar, now.     That
means you're in my world, got it?

Person_2
Got it.

Side_3
That son of a bitch has screwed up this
program enough. All this --
-- exists so we can go out there and
build a bridge of trust to these people,
who could teach us so much. But thanks
to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't
even talk to us anymore.

Person_2
Then how's this supposed to work?

Side_3
We have a new face.
You're fluent, you've studied the
culture. You're non-threatening. The
ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan --
may give you a chance. Maybe you can get
them back to the table before things go
tits-up for good.

Side_1
This is failing as a pep talk.

Person_2
How do we contact them?

Side_3
We don't. They contact us. If they see
us taking our samples, treating the
forest with respect --
Not trampling everything in sight --
they may reach out to us.

Person_2
Or they may skin us and make a drum.

Side_3
Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do
the talking.

Side_3
Looks like a bull, six cows and some
juveniles.

Side_1
The bull has the red on the dorsal armor?

Person_7
Yo Chacon!     Get some!

Side_3
Stay with the ship.
One idiot with a gun's enough.

Person_7
Whatever you say, Doc.

Side_3
Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous.

Side_1
How will they know we're here?

Side_3
I'm sure they're watching us right now.

Side_3
Bring the soil probe -- right there,
yellow case.

Side_1
Why don't they come back?

Person_2
What happened here?

Side_3
See, right here where the roots of the
two trees interact.

Side_3
Don't shoot. You'll piss it off.

Person_2
It's already pissed off!

Side_3
Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me.

Side_3
It's a territorial threat display. Do not
run, or he'll charge.

Person_2
What do I do?

Side_3
Hold your ground!

Person_2
Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right.

Person_2
That's what I'm talkin' about, bitch!

Person_2
That's right motherf--

Person_2
What about this one?       Run, don't run?
What?

Side_3
Run.     Definitely RUN!

Side_3
Shit.

Side_7
Sorry, Doc. He's just gonna have to hang
on `till morning.

Side_3
He's not going to make it till morning.

Side_9
Rrreeyaaah! Hyaaaah!!

Side_9
Raaaarrrr!

Person_2
Wait, don't --

Side_9
Forgive me, my brother.

Person_2
Look, um, I know you probably don't
understand this. But -- thanks. Thank
you. I owe you.

Side_9
Forgive me. May your spirit run with the
Great Mother.

Person_2
I would have been screwed if you hadn't
come along --

Person_2
Hey, wait. Wait!   Where you goin'?

Person_2
Slow down a second will you. I just want
to thank you for killing those --

Side_9
Don't thank! You don't thank for this!
This is sad. Very sad, only.

Person_2
Okay, I'm sorry.    Whatever I did -- I'm
sorry.

Side_9
All this is your fault! They did not need
to die.

Person_2
They attacked me.   How'm I the bad guy

Side_9
Your fault! You are like a baby, making
noise, don't know what to do. You should
not come here, all of you! You only come
and make problems. Only.

Person_2
Okay, fine, you love your little forest
friends. So why not just let them kill
my ass? What's the thinking?

Side_9
Why save you?

Person_2
Yes, why save me?

Side_9
You have a strong heart.   No fear.

Side_9
But stupid! Ignorant like a child!

Person_2
If I'm so ignorant, maybe you should
teach me.

Side_9
Sky people can not learn.   You do not
See.

Person_2
Whooaa.

Person_2
Then teach me to "see."

Side_9
No one can teach you to See.

Person_2
Hey, slow down. Look, I think we just
got off on the wrong foot and --

Person_2
--you just have to get to know me. I'm
Jake. Jake Sull--

Person_2
Whooaaa -- shit!

Person_2
I need your help.

Side_9
You should not be here.

Person_2
So take me with you.

Side_9
No. You go back.

Person_2
What?

Person_2
What are they?

Side_9
Atokirina'. Seeds of the Great Tree --
very pure spirits.

Person_2
What was that all about?

Side_9
Come!

Person_2
What's your name?

Person_2
What's going on?

Side_9
My father is deciding whether to kill
you.

Person_2
Your father!?
Uh, good to meet you, sir.

Side_9
That is Mother. She is Tsahik -- the one
who interprets the will of Eywa.

Person_2
Who's Eywa?

Side_10
What are you called?

Person_2
Jake Sully.

Side_10
Why did you come to us?

Person_2
I came to learn.

Side_10
We have tried to teach other Sky People.
It is hard to fill a cup which is already
full.

Person_2
My cup is empty, trust me. Just ask
Doctor Augustine. I'm no scientist.

Side_10
What are you?

Person_2
I don't know. I was a Marine -- uh, a
warrior. Of the Jarhead clan.

Person_2
What's going on?   What are they saying?

Side_10
Daughter. You will teach him our way, to
speak and walk as we do.

Side_10
My daughter will teach you our ways.
Learn well, Jakesully. We will see if
your insanity can be cured.

Person_2
So it's all good, right?   You and me --

Side_9
Do not speak.

Person_2
Don't get up.

Person_2
You never told me your name.

Side_9
Neytiri te Ckaha Mo'at'ite.

Person_2
Okay, again, a whole lot slower.

Side_9
Neytiri. Nay-TEE-ree.

Person_2
Nay-TEE-ree. That's nice. Nay-TEE-ree.

Person_2
Your mom likes me.    I can tell.

Side_11
You speak truth. We must understand
these Sky People if we are to drive them
out.

Person_2
These rock. What are they?

Side_9
Teylu. You call beetle larvae.

Person_2
That's some damn fine teylu. That's like
grandma's teylu.

Side_3
Come on back, kid, that's it.

Person_2
Wha --? Oh.

Side_3
Damn, you were dug in like a tick.
Is the avatar safe?

Person_2
Yeah, Doc -- and you are not going to
believe where I am.

Side_3
-- so the kid's out there one night and
he's got the Queen Bitch herself offering
him the spare room and the car keys.
Unbelievable.

Person_2
It's not something you can teach.

Side_2
That's awesome, Jake.

Side_3
For reasons I cannot fathom, the
Omaticaya have chosen you. God help us
all.

Person_9
Jarhead clan?
And that worked?

Person_9
That's how you seize the initiative. I
wish I had ten more like you.

Side_4
Look, Sully -- find out what these blue
monkeys want.

Side_4
Their damn village is sitting right over
the richest unobtanium deposit for a
hundred klicks in any direction. Which
sucks -- for them -- because they need to
relocate.

Person_2
Does Augustine know about this?

Side_4
Yeah, she does, and she's on the next
ship back if she tries to cock-block me
on it.

Person_2
So -- who talks them into moving?

Person_2
What if they won't go?

Side_4
Killing the indigenous looks bad, but
there's one thing shareholders hate more
than bad press -- and that's a bad
quarterly statement. Find me a carrot to
get them to move, or it's going to have
to be all stick.

Person_9
You got three months.    That's when the
dozers get there.

Person_2
I'm on it.

Person_2
Tsu'tey.
Mo'at.
Eytukan.

Side_3
He's the clan leader --
-- but she's the spiritual leader.   Like
a shaman.

Person_2
Got it. So who's this Eywa?

Side_1
Who's Eywa? Oh, only their deity. The
Great Mother. The goddess made up of all
living things. You'd know that if you
had any training whatsoever.

Person_2
Who's got a date with the chief's
daughter?

Side_3
Knock it off. Jesus, it's like
kindergarten around here.

Side_3
Neytiri was my best student. She and her
sister Silwanin. Just amazing girls.

Person_2
I didn't meet the sister.

Side_2
Link is ready.

Side_3
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

Side_9
This is shahaylu -- the bond. Feel her
heartbeat, her breath. Feel her strong
legs.

Side_9
You may tell her what to do --
-- inside. For now, say where to go.

Person_2
Forward.

Side_9
Again.

Side_12
You should go away.

Person_2
I knew this guy could speak English.

Side_9
Again.

Person_2
You've got outer columns, then a
secondary ring here, and an inner ring.
Then a core structure, it's like a
spiral, that's how they move up and down.

Person_9
I'm going to need accurate scans of all
these columns.

Person_2
Roger that.

Side_3
I'm not about to let Quaritch and
Selfridge micro-manage this thing.
We're going up into the mountains.

Side_1
The Hallelujah Mountains?

Side_3
That's right.

Side_1
Yesssss!
The legendary Floating Mountains of
Pandora? Heard of them?

Side_7
It only takes tiny inputs.   Here, put
your hand on the cyclic --

Side_7
Feel how small the moves are? You barely
have to think it, and the aircraft
reacts.

Side_3
See these magnetic formations.   We're
getting close.

Side_7
Yeah we are. Look at my instruments.

Side_3
Yup. We're in the flux vortex.

Side_1
Oh. My. God.

Side_7
You should see your face.

Side_3
Jake, take number two, it's the least
glitchy. Norm, I need you to operate
Jake's link.

Person_2
Hey. You got a problem?

Side_1
I trained three years for this mission.
I speak the language fluently.
He falls off the frickin' turnip truck
and all of a sudden he's cultural
ambassador!?

Side_3
It's not our choice, Norm.

Side_1
Yeah, well I didn't come out here to wash
the dishes while you're on some
interspecies booty call.

Side_3
He can't go far.

Side_3
Let's get you in.

Person_2
Holy shit.

Side_9
Do not look in her eye.

Side_9
Ikran is not horse. Once shahaylu is
made, ikran will fly with only one Hunter
in the whole life.

Side_9
To become taronyu -- Hunter -- you must
choose your own ikran. And he must choose
you.

Person_2
When?

Side_9
When you are ready.

Side_9
Heeyaaahh!

Person_2
Do I have to do this?   I need some rack.

Side_3
No -- now, when it's fresh.

Person_2
Yeah, yeah.
The days are starting to blur together.
The language is a bitch, but I figure
it's like field-stripping a weapon.
Repetition.

Person_2
Seyri.

Person_2
Ontu, mikyun, nari.

Side_1
Thank you?

Person_2
Ireiyo.

Side_1
Irrrreiyo. Irrrreiyo.   You've gotta roll
the R, r-r-r-oll it.

Side_3
I See you, Neytiri Mo'at'ite.

Side_9
I See you, Doctor Grace Augustine.

Side_9
When you hear nothing, you will hear
everything. When you see nothing, you
will See everything.

Side_3
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there. You need to
listen to what she says. Try to see the
forest through their eyes.

Person_2
Excuse me -- this is my video-log here,
okay?

Side_9
A clean kill. You are ready.

Side_3
You're still losing weight.   Here --

Person_2
I made a kill today. We ate it.   I know
where that meal came from.

Side_3
Other body. You need to take care of
this body.

Person_2
Yeah yeah.

Side_3
Jake, I'm serious -- you look like crap.
You're burning too hard.

Person_2
Get rid of this shit, then you can
lecture me.

Side_3
I'm telling you, as your boss and someone
who might even consider being a friend
someday, to take some down time.

Person_2
Not now. Tomorrow we leave for Iknimaya.

Side_3
Yeah -- you're gonna go ride a banshee.
Or die trying.

Person_2
That's right, Grace. This is what I've
been working for.

Side_3
And this is your check up from the neck
up, Marine. You're getting in way too
deep.
Trust me, I learned the hard way.

Person_2
What did happen at the school?

Side_3
Neytiri's sister -- Sylwanin -- stopped
coming to school. She was angry about
the clear-cutting.

Side_3
One day, she and a couple of other young
hunters came running in, all painted up --
they'd set a bulldozer on fire -- I guess
they thought I could protect them.

Side_3
The troopers pursued them to the
schoolhouse.

Side_3
They killed Sylwanin in the doorway.
Right in front of Neytiri. Then shot the
others.
I got most of the kids out, before they
shot me.

Person_2
Jesus.

Side_3
Yeah.

Side_3
A scientist stays objective -- we can not
be ruled by emotion. But I poured ten
years of my life into that school. They
called me sa'atenuk. Mother.
That kind of pain reaches back through
the link.

Side_3
It's a job. Learn what you can -- but
don't get attached.

Side_3
It's not our world, Jake.   And we can't
stop what's coming.

Person_2
We doin' this?

Side_12
Jakesully will go first.

Person_2
How will I know if he chooses me?

Side_9
He will try to kill you.

Person_2
Outstanding.

Person_2
Let's dance.

Person_2
That's right! You're mine.

Side_9
First flight seals the bond. You cannot
wait.

Person_2
Heeeyyyaaaah!

Person_2
Shut the hell up!!

Person_2
Level out!     Fly straight!

Side_3
The Great Leonopteryx is the apex aerial
predator. Not only rare, but the
sightings tend not to get reported.

Side_7
There usually isn't time to key the mike.

Person_2
The People call it Toruk.

Person_2
Last one you ever see.

Side_7
I saw one take out a gunship once --
WHAM! Total frickin' yard sale. Ate the
crew like peanuts.

Person_2
That's it.

Side_3
Vitraya Ramunong -- The Well of Souls.
It's their most sacred place.

Side_3
Something big is going on in there,
biologically. I'd die to get samples, but
outsiders are strictly forbidden.

Side_7
They're coming back.

Side_7
If you don't give him something, he's
gonna shut us down.

Person_2
Hey, guys.

Side_9
My grandfather's grandfather was Toruk
Macto -- Rider of Last Shadow. Toruk
chose him. It has only happened five
times since the time of the First Songs.

Person_2
That's a long time.

Side_9
Toruk Macto was mighty -- he brought the
clans together in a time of great sorrow.
All Na'vi people know this story.

Side_3
Watch that stuff.   It'll knock you into
next week.

Side_12
I thought -- enough drink -- you would
not be so ugly.

Person_2
Sorry.

Side_12
Your warriors -- hide inside machines --
fight from far away.
I did not think a sky person could be
brave.

Side_9
You must dance! It is the way.

Person_2
I can barely remember my old life. I'm
not sure who I am anymore.

Side_4
Good of you to stop by. How's it going
out there? Our blue friends all packed
up yet?

Side_4
See, I keep hooking it.   It's the damn
pack.

Side_4
The low gravity and the high air density
cancel out so --

Person_2
You called us back to report -- you want
to hear it or not?

Side_4
Go ahead.

Side_3
Jake is making incredible progress, years
worth in just a few months. But -- we
need more time.

Side_4
Not what I was hoping to hear.

Side_3
Parker, it's their ancestral home.
They've lived there since before human
history began. You can spare them a few
more weeks.

Side_4
This thing is inevitable. What does it
matter when it happens? I'm sorry, Dr.
Augustine. You're out of time.

Person_9
You're not gettin' lost in the woods, are
you son?

Person_9
Your last report was two weeks ago. I'm
starting to doubt your resolve. From what
I see, it's time to terminate this
mission.

Person_2
No.    I can do this.

Person_9
Look, you've given me plenty of usable
intel. Like this "Well of Souls" place --
I've got them by the balls with that,
when it turns into a shit-fight. Which it
will.

Person_9
Side_13
So you'll get your legs back, like I
promised.
(puts his hand on Jake's
It's time to come in.

Person_2
I've gotta finish this thing. There's
one more test -- the Dream Hunt. It's the
final stage of becoming a man. Then I'm
one of them. They'll trust what I say...

Person_2
... and I can negotiate the terms of
their relocation.

Person_9
Then you need to get it done, Corporal.

Side_3
Jake, I can't allow this.   You're just
not strong enough.

Person_2
It's the last door -- I'm going through
it. You can help me or get out of the
way.

Side_3
Will you listen to me? Sometimes the
Na'vi themselves die in these vision
quests. The venom takes you to the edge
of death.

Side_1
Calibrating. Thirty seconds.

Side_3
No matter what you prove out there-- you
are still in here.
Right here.

Person_2
I have to go all the way -- become one of

Side_3
Our life out there takes millions of
dollars of machinery to sustain. You
visit -- and you leave.

Person_2
You know why I'm here? Because Quaritch
sent me.

Side_1
What?

Person_2
That's right -- to embed with the
Omaticaya. To find out how to screw them
out of their home. By deceit or by
force, he didn't care. And if it turned
out to be force, then how best to do it.

Side_3
And what about now, Jake?

Person_2
I'm not that guy any more.

Side_3
I know.

Person_2
But if I tell Quaritch the truth, he
yanks me out -- I never see her again.
And if I tell her the truth, the clan
throws me out -- that's if they don't cut
my heart out and show it to me.

Side_1
They won't understand what you've done.

Person_2
They don't even have a word for "lie" --
they had to learn it from us.

Side_3
I know. I taught it to them.

Side_1
Link is ready.

Side_3
Jake. You can't carry this burden much
longer.

Person_2
It's okay. Mo'at says an alien mind
probably can't survive the Dream Hunt
anyway.

Side_3
Prep my link. I'm going in.

Side_9
When your Spirit Animal comes, you will
know.

Side_10
It is finished.

Side_10
Something has come.
It will take time for the meaning to be
clear.

Side_9
This is a place for prayers to be heard.
And sometimes answered.

Person_2
It's like -- a sound you feel.

Side_9
We call this utraya mokri -- the Tree of
Voices. The voices of our ancestors, who
live within Eywa.

Side_9
You are Omaticaya now. You may make your
own bow from the wood of Hometree.
And you may choose a woman.

Side_9
We have many fine women. Ninat is the
best singer --

Person_2
I don't want Ninat.

Side_9
There is Beyral -- she is a good hunter --

Person_2
I've already chosen. But this woman must
also choose me.

Side_9
She already has.

Side_9
Kissing is very good. But we have
something better.

Person_2
Neytiri, you know my real body is far
away, sleeping.

Side_9
This body is real.
This spirit is real.

Side_9
When I was first your teacher, I hated
all Sky People. But you have also taught
me.
Spirit is all that matters.

Side_9
I am with you now, Jake. We are mated for
life.

Person_2
We are?

Side_9
Yes. It is our way.
Oh. I forgot to tell?

Person_2
Really, we are?

Side_9
We are.

Person_2
It's cool. I'm there.

Side_9
Jake! Wake up! Where ever you are, come
back to me now. Jake!

Side_3
Here -- eat this. I'd hate to have to
force-feed a cripple.

Side_3
And when was the last time you took a
shower? Jesus, Marine.

Person_2
Hey!    Heeeey! Stop! Stop!

Side_14
Hey, I got one of the natives blockin' my
blade here.

Side_15
What do we do?

Side_4
Roll on. He'll move. These people have
to learn that we don't stop.

Side_14
I'm blind.

Person_9
Freeze it, right -- there.

Side_4
Son of a bitch!

Person_9
Get me a pilot!

Side_12
You do not speak here!

Person_2
Okay, listen. There's something I have to
tell you. It's gonna be hard. I just
need you to --

Side_12
You!

Side_12
You mated with this woman?!

Side_3
Oh shit.

Side_10
Is this true?

Side_10
Neytiri! If you choose this path, you can
never be Tsahik. Your life will be
wasted.

Side_9
I have chosen.

Side_12
Yeeeeeaaa!

Side_12
I challenge you.

Side_3
Jake, don't --

Person_2
I accept.

Side_7
Loveshack this is Samson One Six inbound
hot to your pos. I have Colonel Quaritch
with me and --

Person_9
Did I tell you to announce us?

Side_7
Sorry sir, it's procedure.

Side_1
Samson One Six?   Trudy?
Crap.

Side_3
What the hell are you doing?

Person_2
It's the only way to get him to goddamn
listen.

Side_1
Hey, hang on, you can't interrupt a link
in progress, it's dangerous -- wait!

Person_2
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!

Person_9
You crossed a line.

Person_9
You let me down, son. You got a little
local pussy and completely forgot what
team you play for.

Side_3
Parker, listen, there may still be time
to --

Person_9
Shut your fucking hole!

Side_3
Or what, Ranger Rick? You gonna shoot
me?
You need to muzzle your dog!

Side_4
Can we just take this down a couple
notches, please.

Person_2
You say you want to keep your people
alive. Start by listening to her.

Side_3
This is bad, Parker. Those trees were
sacred to the Omaticaya in a way you
can't imagine.

Side_4
You know what? You throw a stick in the
air around here it falls on some sacred
fern.

Side_3
I'm not talking about pagan voodoo here --
I'm talking about something real and
measurable in the biology of the forest.

Side_3
I can't do this. How am I supposed to
reduce years of work to a sound bite for
the illiterate?

Person_2
Just tell him what you know in your
heart.

Side_3
Alright, look -- I don't have the answers
yet, I'm just now starting to even frame
the questions. What we think we know --
is that there's some kind of
electrochemical communication between the
roots of the trees. Like the synapses
between neurons. Each tree has ten to the
fourth connections to the trees around
it, and there are ten to the twelfth
trees on Pandora --

Side_4
That's a lot I'm guessing.

Side_3
That's more connections than the human
brain. You get it? It's a network -- a
global network. And the Na'vi can access
it -- they can upload and download data --
memories -- at sites like the one you
destroyed.

Side_4
What the hell have you people been
smoking out there? They're just.
Goddamn. Trees.

Side_3
You need to wake up, Parker. The wealth
of this world isn't in the ground -- it's
all around us. The Na'vi know that, and
they're fighting to defend it. If you
want to share this world with them, you
need to understand them.

Person_9
We understand them just fine.   Thanks to
Jake here.

Person_9
Since a deal can't be made -- it gets
real simple.
So thanks. I'm getting all emotional.    I
might just give you a big wet kiss.

Side_3
Parker, we have to talk, like rational
people.

Side_4
Well, I'd cherish that, but unfortunately
you're out of here on the next shuttle.
All of you. I'm shutting down the Avatar
Program, effective now.

Person_7
They hit with banshees first. Set the
ampsuit on fire. Driver's toast.

Person_9
The rest of the squad?

Person_7
Six bodies -- that's all of `em. And the
equipment is totalled.

Side_4
Christ.

Person_9
I can do it with minimal casualties to
the indigenous. We'll clear them out
with gas first. It'll be humane. More or
less.

Person_9
Hey, don't go limp on me now. This is
exactly the incident we needed.

Side_4
Alright, let's pull the trigger.

Side_3
They bulldozed a sacred site on purpose,
to trigger a response. They're
fabricating this war to get what they
want.

Side_1
I can't believe that.

Person_2
Yup. That's how it's done. When people
are sitting on shit you want, you make
them your enemy. Then you're justified in
taking it.

Side_7
Sec-ops is rolling the gunships.   They're
gonna hit Hometree!

Person_2
When?

Side_7
Now.    We're spooling up now! I gotta go.

Side_3
My God.

Side_3
Parker, wait. Stop! These are people
you're about to --

Side_4
They're fly-bitten savages who live in a
tree! Look around -- I don't know about
you but I see a lot of trees. They can
move.

Side_3
For God's sake, there are children in
there. Babies!

Person_2
Look Selfridge, you don't want this kind
of blood on your hands. Let me try to
talk them out. They trust me.

Side_4
You've got one hour. Unless you want
your girlfriend in there when the axe
comes down, you get them to evacuate. One
hour.

Side_10
Are you certain of this?

Person_2
They sent me here to learn your ways. So
one day I could bring this message, and
you would believe it.

Side_9
What are you saying, Jake? You knew this
would happen?

Person_2
Yes.
At first it was just orders. Then
everything changed. I fell in love--
with the forest, with the Omaticaya
People --
-- with you. And by then, how could I
tell you?

Side_9
I trusted you, Jake!

Person_2
Neytiri. Please, I only wanted to --

Side_9
You will never be one of the People!

Person_9
Well, I'd say diplomacy has failed.

Person_9
I think they mean to cut their throats if
we don't back off. Make sure you get a
nice close-up of that. I can tack it onto
the after-action report.

Person_2
You have to get out of Hometree! Run to
the forest! Please, I'm begging you!

Person_9
Alright, let's get this done. Give me
forty millimeter gas rounds, right in the
front door.

Side_16
Roger.   CS forties. Going hot.

Person_9
Fire.

Side_11
Everybody outside! Go to the Forest.

Side_10
You are one of us.   Help us!

Person_2
We've gotta move!    He's gonna blow the
columns.

Person_9
That's how you scatter the roaches. Okay,
switch missiles. Give me H-E's at the
base of the west columns.

Side_7
Screw it.

Person_9
Bring it down.

Person_9
Nice work people. Alright, let's light
it up.

Person_2
Neytiri!   Neytiri!

Person_2
I'm sorry --

Side_9
Get away from me, Jake. Go away! Never
come back!

Side_4
Pull the plug.

Side_3
They never wanted us to succeed.

Side_7
Personally I think steak's too good for
these traitors.

Side_17
They get steak?    That's bullshit. Let me
see that --

Side_7
Oops.
All the way down, pendejo.

Side_2
That was unexpectedly satisfying.

Side_1
Baby, you rock.

Person_2
Thanks.

Person_2
So what do you say?    Time for a
revolution?

Side_3
I'm free.

Person_2
Come on.

Person_2
Get your ship fired up.

Person_2
Stay here. I need somebody on the inside
I can trust.

Side_18
I need you to shut down and step out of
the vehicle! Now!

Person_2
Take it nice and easy, troop.

Person_2
On the ground, face down. Hands behind
your head.

Side_3
Do what he goddamn says!

Person_2
Go! Go! Go!

Person_2
Oh yeah, baby!

Side_3
Aaahh, crap. Not again.

Side_3
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

Person_2
Hang on, Grace.

Side_7
Well, at least they won't be able to
track us up here. Not this deep in the
vortex.

Person_2
It's strongest at the Well of Souls,
right?

Side_7
Yeah.

Person_2
Good, `cause that's where we're going.

Side_7
Copy.

Person_2
I'm gonna get you some help, Grace.

Side_3
Forget it, it doesn't matter.

Person_2
No!   The People can help you. I know it.

Person_2
I've gotta try, Norm.

Person_2
Come on, boy. Time to fly.

Side_9
Toruk Macto.

Side_19
Toruk Macto... Toruk Macto...

Side_9
I See you.

Person_2
I See you.

Side_9
I was afraid Jake -- for my people. I'm
not any more.

Side_12
I will fly with you.

Person_2
Ireiyo.

Person_2
Grace is dying.     I beg the help of the
Great Mother.

Side_10
Bring her, Jakesully.

Person_2
Look where we are, Grace.

Side_3
I need to take some samples.

Side_10
-- in this body.

Person_2
Is that possible?

Side_10
Possible, yes. She must pass through the
Eye of Eywa -- and return. But Jakesully--
she is very weak.

Person_2
Hang on, they're gonna fix you up.

Side_3
I -- always held back. But you gave them
your heart. I'm proud of you, Jake.

Side_3
Help them.     You do whatever it takes. You
hear me?

Person_2
I will.

Side_3
I'm with her Jake --
-- she's real --

Person_2
Grace!

Side_10
Her wounds were too great, there was not
enough time. She is with Eywa now.

Person_2
With your permission, I will Speak now.
You would honor me by translating.

Person_2
The Sky People have sent a message that
they can take whatever they want, and no
one can stop them. But we will send them
a message. Ride out, as fast as the wind
can carry you, tell the other clans to
come. Tell them Toruk Macto calls to
them. Fly now with me brothers and
sisters! Fly! And we will show the Sky
People that this is our land!

Person_9
People, you are fighting for survival.
There's an aboriginal horde out there
massing for an attack. First slide.

Person_9
These orbital images show the hostiles'
numbers have gone from a couple of
hundred to over two thousand in one day,
and more are pouring in. By next week it
could be twenty thousand. Then they'll be
overrunning our perimeter here. We can't
wait. Our only security lies in pre-
emptive attack. We will fight terror
with terror.

Person_9
Next slide. This mountain stronghold is
supposedly protected by their deity.
When we destroy it, we will blast a
crater in their racial memory so deep
they won't come within a thousand klicks
of this place.

Side_4
This thing is completely out of control!

Side_4
Listen to me! I am not authorizing you to
turn the mine-workers local into a
freakin' militia!

Person_9
I declared threat condition red. That
puts all on-world assets under my
command.

Side_4
You think you can pull this palace coup
shit on me?! I can have your ass with
one call --

Person_9
You're a long way from Earth.

Person_9
Get him out of here.

Side_4
You touch me you're so fired.

Side_2
I don't know how secure this channel is.

Person_2
Talk fast.

Side_2
It's crazy here, Jake. It's full
mobilization. They're rigging the
shuttles as bombers. They've made up
these big pallets of mine explosives.
It's for some kind of shock and awe
campaign.

Side_7
Frickin' daisycutters.

Side_1
Holy shit.

Person_2
Can you talk to Selfridge? Maybe we can
cut some kinda deal before this thing
goes all the way.

Side_2
No, Quaritch has taken over. He's
rolling and there's no stopping him.

Person_2
When?

Side_2
Oh six hundred tomorrow.

Person_2
Thanks.

Side_1
We're screwed.

Side_7
You know he's gonna commit those bombers
straight to the Well of Souls.

Person_2
That's right. Because I gave it to him
on a plate.

Side_7
We both did.

Side_1
If he takes out the Well of Souls -- it's
over. It's their main line to Eywa, to
their ancestors -- it'll destroy them.

Person_2
Then I guess we better stop him.

Side_7
You need to get some rack.

Person_2
Gonna have to settle for coffee.

Person_2
Strike here and here.

Person_2
Yeah.

Side_7
Going up against gunships with bows and
arrows...

Person_2
What's your point?

Person_2
I've never done this in my life.

Person_2
And I'm probably just talking to a tree
right now. But if you're there -- I need
to give you a heads up.

Person_2
If Grace is there with you -- look in her
memories -- she can show you the world we
come from. There's no green there. They
killed their Mother, and they're gonna do
the same thing here.

Person_2
More Sky People are gonna come. They're
gonna come like a rain that never ends --

Person_2
-- until they've covered the world.
Unless we stop them.

Side_9
Our Great Mother does not take sides.
She protects only the balance of life.

Person_2
It was worth a try.

Person_7
Contact. Two hundred meters.

Person_9
Fire for effect.

Side_1
Jake!   Jake! We're falling back!

Person_9
Blue team, switch forties.   Fire at will.

Side_6
Yeah baby!     Get some!

Person_9
Blue team, stay with the ground units.
Red team, with me. We're punching for
the main target.

Side_7
You're not the only ones with guns, you
pricks.

Person_9
There it is.
Valkyrie One, this is Dragon. Target is
in sight.

Side_18
Target in sight.

Person_2
We have to stop the shuttles, no matter
what it takes.

Person_7
I hear this is worse than death for you,
chief.

Side_18
Right flank -- something's coming!   It's
all lit up out there.

Person_2
What the hell -- ?

Person_7
A and C squads -- rally at my pos.   I
want --
Who's screaming God damn it?!

Person_7
Shutup you crybabies!

Side_2
Rogue One, Rogue One, this is Max.   Tell
Jake we are in motion.
Get in there. Barricade the door!

Side_20
Mains to a hundred percent!   Get me
airspeed!

Side_20
We're good!

Side_20
Valkyrie Two is breaking off. And if any
of ya'll want to get off this piece of
shit planet, you better cover our ass,
`cause we're the only way back to orbit.

Side_21
Roger that.

Person_9
Get back here you worthless pukes!

Side_20
Are we breaking off?

Person_9
What do you think?

Side_4
What the hell is going on out there?

Side_20
Sir, all ground units are falling back to
the LZ.

Person_9
Stay on target.

Person_9
Switch missiles. Arm all pods.

Side_20
Arming.

Person_9
Let's see what these blue bastards do
when I bitch-slap their goddess.

Person_9
Put your mask on.

Person_2
Quaritch is gonna take out the Well of
Souls! He's got a clear shot. Hit him,
anybody that can! Do it now!

Side_7
On it.

Side_1
No!

Side_7
Norm, I love you.

Side_18
Dragon is down. It's off the board.

Side_4
What do you mean, off the board?!

Side_4
Oh shit.

Person_9
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

Person_2
Kinda hoped you'd say that.

Person_9
How does it feel to betray your own race?

Person_2
I See you, Tsu'tey te Rongloa Ateyitan.

Side_12
Are the people safe?

Person_2
They're safe.

Side_12
I can never ride again, or bond with my
woman -- or hear the voice of Eywa. I can
not lead the People. You will lead them,
Jakesully.

Person_2
No. I'm not officer material.

Side_12
It is decided. Now do the duty of
Olo'eyctan. Set my spirit free.

Person_2
I'm not killing you.

Side_12
I am already dead.

Person_2
No.

Side_12
It is the way. And it is good. I will be
remembered --

Side_12
-- I fought with Toruk Macto, we were
brothers -- and he was my last shadow.

Person_2
The science guys will keep the lights on,
here. But I won't miss this place.

Person_1
I'm on hold with the INS.
Don't you think we should double
check the triangulation before we

Person_2
We have double checked it.

Person_1
Yes. I'm trying to reach-
No, I don't think you understand how
serious this is.
Because if you did, we'd be having
this conversation in person.

Person_2
What did they say?

Person_1
They said we should look out the
window.

Person_2
Is that really necessary?

Person_3
You've been complaining for years
that the government doesn't take
your project seriously enough, Doctor.
You can't have it both ways.

Person_2
Yesterday morning, our facility in
Hanford identified this signal: a
neutron star colliding with a
supermassive black hole. We went
through the last year's data and
triangulated the source.

Person_3
We know that, Doctor. What we don't
know is why, according to your
numbers, this event took place right
here in our own solar system.

Person_2
It didn't. Because if it had we'd
all be dead by now.

Person_2
Which leaves only one explanation:
The signal traveled through a

Person_2
wormhole. A gateway to a distant
corner of the universe. The black
hole is on the far side.

Person_3
I've read your book, Doctor. You
said that wormholes are impossible.

Person_2
There is nothing quite as satisfying
as being proved utterly wrong.
I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
naturally. Not for more than a few
billionths of a second. It would
have to be... stabilized.

Person_3
Stabilized by what?

Person_1
We don't have any way to answer that
question.

Person_2
If you're worried about an invasion,
I would start drafting the articles
of surrender.
Whoever they are, if they can build
a wormhole, they could erase us in
the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
also means we have nothing they could
be interested in.

Person_3
Then why is it there?

Person_2
I don't know. Maybe it's an
invitation. A chance to commune
with an advanced species.

Person_3
You don't agree?

Person_2
We need to get back to work. I have
a conference call with our European
partners in fifteen minutes.

Person_3
We severed the connections to your
European partners this morning.

Person_4
We'll send them a check.
Your project is now classified under
the State Secrets Act.

Person_1
They can't keep this a secret. You
know that. Sooner or later...

Person_2
I don't care about that. I've spent
my whole life being afraid we would
wipe ourselves out before this moment
arrived. We've made so many mistakes,
I wasn't sure we'd make it...

Person_2
But this will change everything.
Fifty years from now, nothing will
be the same.

Person_5
Seized up on us.

Person_6
Long way to come by bus. I thought
you guys would have a plane.

Person_5
We did. Ran out of parts for it.
You know anything about diesels?

Person_6
A little.

Person_5
You think your dad's going to be
able to help us out?

Person_7
My dad can fix anything.
Except maybe your fastball.

Person_5
Sure appreciate the help.

Person_8
Popcorn at a ball game is unnatural.
I want a hot dog.

Person_9
Is that a comet, Dad?

Person_6
Satellite. Big one. Probably
Chinese.

Person_8
Those clowns would get their asses
handed to them by the ballplayers I
grew up watching.

Person_6
You ruin it for the boys when you
talk like that.

Person_8
I'm not doing my grandkids any favors
by lying to them. They're growing
up watching lousy baseball.

Person_6
They didn't have any baseball at all
when I was a kid.

Person_8
Nelson's burning up his crops. Found
some of the blight on the okra.

Person_6
I thought okra wasn't susceptible.

Person_6
Something wrong with your truck?

Person_8
Be nice to Murph's teacher. She's
single, you know.

Person_6
What does that have to do with
anything?

Person_8
We're supposed to be repopulating
the earth. Gotta pull your weight.
Besides, the boys could do with a
woman in their lives.

Person_6
Get the spare, Tom.

Person_9
That is the spare.

Person_6
All right. We'll use the patch kit.

Person_7
I... I think the patch kit might not
be there...
Because I was using it for my bike.

Person_6
Murph's law.

Person_9
The kid doesn't even know what he
was named after...

Person_9
Murph's law means what can go wrong
will go wrong.

Person_6
Find something to patch it with.

Person_9
How am I supposed to do that?

Person_6
Figure it out. I'm not always going
to be here to help you.

Person_7
Is that really why I'm named Murph,
dad?

Person_6
Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't
mean that. It means what can happen
will happen. All kinds of things.
Good or bad. And that's the way you
want it to be.

Person_7
Why?

Person_6
Because if nothing ever happened to
you then you wouldn't learn anything.

Person_6
Murph?

Person_6
Get in.

Person_9
What about the tire?

Person_6
It's a Chinese military drone. Solar
cells could power an entire farm.
Take the wheel.

Person_6
Keep it pointed right at it, OK?

Person_6
Faster, Tom. I'm losing it.

Person_6
Almost got it. Don't slow down.

Person_9
We lost it.

Person_6
You want to give it a whirl?

Person_6
Set her down in the valley -- there,
next to the river.

Person_9
How long do you think it's been up
there, Dad?

Person_6
Chinese mission control went down
same as us, twenty years ago. It's
been up there ever since.

Person_9
What was it doing flying so low?

Person_6
It was looking for something.
Intercepted some kind of signal.
It's been at eighty thousand feet.
Sun probably cooked its brain.

Person_7
What are you going to do with it?

Person_6
Reprogram it. Give it something
socially responsible to do like drive
a combine or a tractor.

Person_6
We need all the help we can get,
Murph. This thing has to adapt,
just like the rest of us.

Side_1
Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This
is Ms. Kelly, Murph's teacher.

Side_1
So we've gotten Tom's score back.
Congratulations. He's going to make
an excellent farmer.

Person_6
What about college?

Side_1
The University of California only
accepts a few hundred students a
year, Mr. Cooper. You have to be
realistic.

Person_6
You're ruling out college for him
now? He's only fifteen.

Side_1
I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score
simply isn't high enough.

Person_6
What are you, about a 36-inch waist?
30-inch inseam?

Side_1
I'm not sure I see--

Person_6
You're telling me you need two numbers
to measure your own ass, but just
one to measure my son's future?

Side_1
I understand you're a well-educated
man, Mr. Cooper. A scientist?

Person_6
Engineer.

Side_1
Frankly, the world doesn't need any
more engineers. We didn't run out
of trains or television sets or
satellites.
We ran out of food.

Side_1
The world needs farmers, Mr. Cooper.
And I'm sure your son Tom is going
to make a fine one.
We're a caretaker generation. But
things are getting better. Maybe
your grandchildren will be able to
attend college.

Person_6
Are we done?

Side_1
One more thing. Ms. Kelly here says
that Murph brought a book to school
about the lunar landings.

Person_6
One of my old textbooks. Murph liked
the pictures.

Side_2
This is one of the old federal
textbooks. We've replaced them with
corrected versions.

Person_6
Corrected?

Side_2
The new textbooks explain that the
Apollo lunar missions were faked in
order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.

Person_6
You don't believe we went to the
moon?

Side_2
I believe it was a brilliant piece
of propaganda. The Soviets spent
years trying to build rockets and
other useless machines.

Person_6
"Useless machines"?

Side_2
Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
wastefulness and excess that the
20th century represented. Your
children would be better off learning
about this planet, rather than reading
fantasies about leaving it.

Person_6
One of those useless machines they
used to make was called an MRI. If
we had any of them left the doctors
might have been able to find the
cyst in my wife's brain before she
died, rather than afterwards. And
then my kids could have been raised
by two parents, instead of me and
their pain-in-the-ass grandfather.

Person_6
You ever consider the best thing for
the world and humanity might have
been for us to part company?

Person_6
Just tell him to power down the
controllers for a couple minutes.

Person_6
Bravo-two-eight, requesting permission
to enter your airspace.

Side_3
Thanks for coming down. Half of 'em
took off last night, looking for
something.
Looks like they found it, too. I
thought you were the man to see it.

Person_6
Not exactly.

Person_6
Space probe. Never seen one like
it, though. Looks like it's been to
hell and back.

Side_3
How do you think it wound up here?

Person_6
Lost, I guess. Guidance satellites
would have been shot down by the
Chinese twenty years ago.

Person_6
Well I don't know what the hell it's
made of, but I can't crack it open.

Person_8
Good. Clear it off the table so I
can serve dinner.

Person_8
What happened this time?

Person_7
I got suspended. Paul said anyone
who believed we went to the moon was
an idiot. So I hit him.

Person_6
Good boy. Hand me the scanner.

Person_6
Here we go. Standard NASA encryption.
Memory's been damaged. Just noise.
Hold on. I've got something.

Person_7
Where is that, dad?

Person_6
I don't know.

Person_6
Where the hell did you come from?

Person_6
We'll take it down to Tyson's tomorrow
and have it melted down. Might be
some copper inside.

Person_7
But what about its mission? What
about the information onboard?

Person_6
There's no one for it to report to.
NASA is all gone. I'm sorry, son.
It got home too late.

Person_8
I heard your meeting at the school
didn't go so well.

Person_6
Maybe it's better for everyone to
forget what they did back then.
Reminds us how far we've fallen.

Person_8
When I was kid, it felt like they
made something new every day. Some
gadget or idea.
Like every day was Christmas.
But we made a lot of mistakes. Six
billion people. Just try to imagine
that. Every last one of them trying
to have it all.

Person_8
The truth is this world isn't that
bad. In a lot of ways its better.
Tom will be all right, whether he
goes to college or not.

Person_6
It doesn't bother me that he can't
go. It bothers me that he doesn't
care.

Person_8
Tom isn't the problem. He fits in
this world just fine. You're the
one who doesn't fit, Coop. You don't
belong here. You were born forty
years too late, or forty years too
early -- I don't know. My daughter
knew it, god bless her. And your
kids know it, too.

Person_8
You were good at something and you
never got a chance to do anything
with it. And I'm sorry, Coop. But
that's not your kids' fault.

Person_7
Try a different direction.

Person_6
It's a fail-safe. It's going to
annoy us into taking it home.

Person_9
What are we going to do?

Person_6
We're going to get some sleep.

Person_7
What are we doing today?

Person_6
You're staying here and cleaning the
house.

Person_6
I told you, Murph. There's no one
to take it back to.

Person_7
But what if there is, dad? What if
there's something we can salvage?

Person_6
Got any diesel?

Side_4
Plenty. Shame you can't eat it.

Person_7
I think it's home.

Person_7
Dad, what are these things?

Person_6
I don't know. Don't touch them.

Person_6
Murph?

Person_6
Careful. There's some kind of
underground facility here. We
might...

Person_7
Is it still... alive?

Person_6
Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't
made them for thirty years. I've
never seen one intact before.

Person_6
I think we need to go, Murph.

Person_7
But can't we take it back? You could
fix it up, get him to do chores.

Person_6
No. I don't know what this place
is, but we're leaving.

Side_5
Tell the boy to stop hitting me.

Person_6
We were just looking for salvage.

Side_6
Is that what they call stealing these
days?

Person_6
I didn't know it belonged to anyone.

Side_6
It doesn't.
You want to let them go, Tars, or do
you want some help with your work?

Person_6
You've got me wrong, lady.

Side_6
Really? You're not the kind of guy
who turns a combat marine with a
supercomputer for a brain into a
riding lawn mower?

Side_6
Get back in your little plane, go
back to your farming commune. And
don't come back.

Side_7
Don't forget your gun.

Person_6
Word of advice -- careful with that
thing. When the war was over, they
didn't know when to stop fighting.

Side_6
I'd trust him a lot more than I'd
trust you. Keep moving.

Person_6
Wait a second--

Side_6
Get it inside.

Side_6
You too. We'll figure out what to
do with you later.

Person_6
Now who's stealing from who?

Side_6
This doesn't belong to you.

Person_6
You're right. It belongs to NASA,
which shut down thirty years ago
when the federal government ran out
of money.

Person_6
Who are you people?

Side_6
I found them outside with it. It
looks like six. Maybe seven. I
can't tell from the radiation damage.

Side_8
Where did you find it?

Person_6
Galveston.

Side_6'S FATHER
Of course. It must have been looking
for Canaveral.

Person_6
Canaveral's been gone for thirty
years.

Side_10
It's not responding to the handshake.
I can't open anything on primary.

Side_6
What did you do to it?

Person_6
Nothing. I got something off of it.

Side_8
Of course. The high voltage allows
you to image the entire memory unit
at once.

Person_6
Most of the disk was noise. Couple
of clean sectors, though.

Side_10
It found something.
Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere.
Trace radiation. Surface is ninety
percent frozen water. Ten percent
rock -- sedimentary composition
similar to limestone.
Wow. Pockets of oxygen below the
surface. Lots and lots of oxygen.
This could be the one, boss.

Person_6
There aren't any planets like that
anywhere near earth. Not even if
this thing was gone for thirty years.

Side_6
He's heard enough. If we're going
to launch, we need to keep them here
until afterwards.

Person_6
You can't keep us here.

Side_6
He could endanger the mission.

Person_6
I'm not going to endanger it any
more than you already have.

Person_6
Are you using that for guidance?

Side_10
Why not? We've tested it a hundred
times.

Person_6
The power supply is no good. If the
voltage fluctuates under load, the
unit will fail.

Side_6
Now how could you possibly know that?

Person_6
Bought thirty of them off a guy in
Florida. Had to rebuild every last
one.
They work great on a riding lawn mower.

Person_6
You plan on keeping us here forever?

Person_7
What are they doing, dad?

Person_6
I guess no one told them they were
out of a job.
Same as the rest of these people.

Side_6
The mission commander wants to see
you. Your son can stay here. He'll
be all right with Tars.

Person_6
I thought the old man was in charge.

Person_6
Not you?

Side_6
I'm a biologist.

Side_11
You're the man who brought us the
probe?
Thank you. We tested the telemetry
board you warned us about. It failed
under high voltage, just as you said.
Come with me, please.

Side_11
You're right, Mr. Cooper. The planet
you saw is a long way from earth. A
very long way indeed.

Side_11
Our science officer doesn't think I
should trust you with any of this.
One of the curious things about humans
is that the more alike you are, the
more initially hostile you are to
each other. As if by design.

Side_11
I've found the best way to earn a
person's trust is to trust them.

Side_11
Side_12
(looks at Brand's
Go ahead, John.

Side_6'S FATHER
It's a wormhole. A shortcut leading
to a galaxy on the far side of the
universe. We found it fifty years
ago.

Side_6'S FATHER
We've been waiting, sending probes
into it for decades. None of them
ever came back. Not until now.

Side_11
Based on the information on the probe,
we're finally preparing to send the
manned mission.

Person_6
That rocket doesn't have enough thrust
or fuel to get you to Jupiter.

Side_11
The main ship was built in orbit.
It has nuclear engines, with enough
fuel to last for several years.

Person_6
Why are you telling me this? I
already told you I'm not going to
tell anyone about this place.

Side_11
I know you won't, Mr. Cooper. We're
telling you this because I want you
to join us.

Side_11
The probe has taken a great deal
longer to return to us than we hoped.

Side_11
Dr. Brand's Father and several other
members of our crew have gotten...
older.

Side_11
We need someone who can run the
systems, improvise, work with what's
available. All of the skills you
seem to have developed.

Person_6
But I don't have any of the
experience. Any training. You people
have been preparing for this for
years.

Side_11
Humans worry about things like rank
and experience. I'm only concerned
with whether someone would be useful.
I think you'd be useful, Mr. Cooper.

Person_6
No. I'm sorry.

Person_6
I can't help you. I have
responsibilities. Things that, no
offense, are more important than a
scientific mission.

Side_11
I'm not a scientist, Mr. Cooper.
And this is not a scientific mission.
It's a rescue mission.

Side_11
Brand can show you the way out. I
hope you'll reconsider.

Person_6
Rescue? Rescue who?

Person_6
The blight.

Side_6
In the last century strands were
limited to one or two species. But
this one targets everything.
Essentially it's more efficient at
consuming our food than we are.

Person_6
But it doesn't affect the corn.

Side_6
Not yet. But it will. We've grown
a dozen forms of it that can. It's
just a matter of time before the
same ones develop out there.
The mission is to rescue us.
Humanity.

Side_6
Who's going to find it? The
universities are a joke. People
like you are reduced to scavenging
just to get by.
The earth has had enough of us. We
have two, maybe three generations
left. Then our time here is over.

Person_6
You've known this for how long? And
you didn't try to tell anyone?

Side_6
What would be the point? So humanity
could spend the last fifty years of
its life fighting over the scraps?
It's better that they don't know.

Side_6
A new home for humanity. We'll set
up a colony, then return to bring
more people across.

Person_6
But you'd still only be able to save
a few hundred. Maybe a thousand.

Side_6
Would it be better if we all died?

Side_6
Look -- I don't have a clue what
Case thinks you could add to the
mission. You can come with us or
you can stay here and wait to die.
I don't care.
But make no mistake -- this mission
is our last chance.

Person_8
You get older, sometimes you just
want to sit back and watch it all
play out. Your life. Your kids'
lives. The whole crazy story.
I didn't think I'd be around for the
end of it.

Person_8
You have to go.

Person_6
I can't go. I have to look after
the boys.

Person_8
You've been preparing these boys to
be on their own since their mom died.
Besides, I'll be here to look after
them, same as I've always been.

Person_6
I have a responsibility to them--

Person_8
That's right. You do.

Person_7
I've been doing the math, dad. I
weigh about 85 pounds. Now that's
an extra ton of fuel. But if-

Person_6
You have to stay here, pal.

Person_6
There's going to be important work
to do here, too.

Person_6
I need you to hold onto this. Will
you do that for me?

Person_7
You're not coming back, are you?

Person_6
I will come back. I promise.

Person_6
Don't look so happy to see me.

Side_10
Tars was a Marine. They gave him a
sense of humor to help him fit in
with his unit better.

Person_6
Great idea. A massive, sarcastic
robot.

Side_7
I have a cue light I can turn on
when I'm joking, if you like.

Person_6
That sounds like a good idea.

Side_7
Great. Maybe you can use it to find
your way back to the ship after I
blow you out the airlock.

Side_6
You don't like this one, you get to
help me find a replacement.

Person_6
I was wondering where you've been
getting your supplies.

Side_6
We knew we'd need decades of parts
and materials. The government was
getting rid of some things. So we
arranged to take some off their hands.

Side_6
You know how to use one?
You just breathe. Tap my arm or
bang something metal if you have a
problem. And don't get lost.

Person_6
So you're a salvage diver now? I
thought you were a biologist.

Side_6
You can set that down over there.

Side_6
We didn't know what kind of gravity
to expect. We experimented with
collective organisms in high g
environments.

Person_6
We're taking ants with us?

Side_6
Humans are also collective organisms.

Person_6
I thought humans were more solitary.

Person_6
Looks like hard work.

Side_6
It's a paradox. Life couldn't form
without gravity. No stars. No
planets. The component pieces would
just drift apart. But too much of
it and you're trapped.

Side_11
We've updated our mission parameters
based on the data from the probe.

Side_11
Based on our latest modelling we
think the region on the far side of
the wormhole is the center of a
galaxy.

Person_6
Is that a star?

Side_13
No. A black hole. There are several
in the region, but this is the largest --
a billion times heavier than the
sun. I call it Gargantua.
Beautiful, isn't it? It's a shame
we won't get to see it up close.

Side_11
We're headed for this smaller black
hole. Roth calls it Pantagruel. We
think the ice planet is here-

Side_11
We exit the wormhole here. And we
slingshot around Pantagruel to reach
the ice planet. This is the period
in which we'll lose time.

Person_6
Lose time?

Side_13
High speed or high gravity both slow
down time, relative to earth.

Side_13
The trip around the black hole will
take us only a few days. But far
more time will be passing back home.

Person_6
How much time?

Side_13
Based on the information from the
probe -- as much as five years.

Side_10
I still think we're making a lot of
assumptions. About the wormhole.
About the planet.
The critical orbit here is incredibly
dangerous. It's like walking on the
rim of the volcano.
Too fast and we get thrown off at
close to the speed of light. Too
slow and we get pulled into the hole
and crushed.

Side_6
As long as we're careful, we'll make
it.

Side_10
How do you know that?

Side_6
I find it hard to believe that someone
would build a wormhole to a planet
with water and oxygen just to lead
us to a dead end.

Side_10
I thought you were a scientist, Brand.
That sounds more like a hypothesis.

Side_6
A guess. That's right. We don't
have time to wait for conclusive
proof.

Side_6
My guess is that the wormhole is
there because someone is trying to
help us. The same way we used to
try to help animals when they were
threatened with extinction.

Person_6
Sure. Till we ran out of food and
ate all of them.

Side_10
What do you think, Roth?

Side_13
If we're guessing, then I'd say
Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't
exist naturally. I think it's there
for a reason. That someone is trying
to help us.

Side_10
So you think we'll have no problem
navigating between two massive black
holes to a tiny planet?

Side_13
I think we'll probably be killed.
I said I thought there was a plan.
Not that the plan was for us to find
a planet like Earth to save a handful
of people.
Birds don't learn to fly just so
that they can find another egg and
crawl back into it.

Side_10
If that's not the plan, then what
are we supposed to be doing out there?

Side_6'S FATHER
Tars here needs to be disassembled.
I figured you could do the honors.

Person_6
I thought I was going to get to enjoy
your company all the way to Mars.

Side_7
You will. My chassis is too heavy
for the rocket stage. They have
another one waiting for me in orbit.

Side_7
If you try to turn me into a combine
harvester, I'm going to--

Side_6'S FATHER
It's noise. I know it's noise. But
it looks too orderly. Probably just
an old man seeing things.

Person_6
We'll be back.

Side_6
I won't.

Side_6
If we find a habitable environment,
I'm staying behind to build the
colony.

Side_14
Would you like me to install the
chip?

Person_6
Oh, no. I want to see this.

Person_6
Bit of a demotion.

Side_7
I wouldn't call it that, exactly.

Person_6
The ship is tiny.

Side_10
So is the wormhole.

Side_7
It's the comms relay. It will allow
us to talk to earth, even on the far
side of the wormhole.

Person_6
I know. So why are you painting it?

Side_7
It helps me calibrate my fine motor
control.

Person_6
Sure it does.
You're pretty good.

Side_7
I learned it during the war.

Person_6
What'd you paint?

Side_7
Tombstones.

Person_9
They said I can start an agriculture
class a year early.

Person_9
I've got to go, Dad. Hope you're
safe up there.

Person_8
I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to
record you a message but he's still...
well, he's still angry with you.
I'll try again next week.

Side_7
Be careful. It's difficult to gauge
mass in zero gravity.

Person_6
How much do these things weigh?

Side_7
Four tons.

Person_6
Damn.

Side_6
Smile.

Person_6
Why?

Side_6
Because it lowers your blood pressure.

Side_11
How are you feeling?

Person_6
Fine. The anesthetic is working.

Side_11
No -- I mean how is your mood? You
seem to be developing good relations
with everyone on the mission. Except
perhaps Ms. Brand.

Side_11
Only five percent of my resources
are devoted to human anatomy. Ten
percent is the mission protocol.
The rest is human psychology.

Person_6
Why?

Side_11
We are floating in a total vacuum in
a plastic ship powered by nuclear
engines. But the most dangerous
thing onboard is the three pounds of
organic material in your skull.

Person_6
If we're such a liability, why take
us along? You and Tars could build
the colony without us. You wouldn't
need to bring food or oxygen.

Side_11
Because humans, despite your obvious
physical shortcomings, are better at
surviving than we are. Your
programming is better than ours.

Person_6
Humans aren't programmed.

Side_11
Would you prefer I was honest? These
things can be uncomfortable for
humans.

Person_6
Did they program you to be
condescending?

Side_11
Yes. Of course.
But you're not supposed to notice.

Side_11
Humans are good at surviving because
evolution gave you magical thinking --
the idea that your relationships
mean something. You can't explain
the feelings, so you think of them
as irrational. But they're not.
They're programming.

Side_11
Exactly. You believe it so much you
won't listen to me.

Person_6
How would that make us better at
surviving?

Side_11
When I die, the last thing I will
see will be a diagnostic of my own
power cycle. Would you like to know
the last thing you will see?

Side_11
This conversation is making you
uncomfortable. We should stop.

Person_6
No. I want to know.

Side_11
The last thing you will see before
you die will be your children.
Your mind does this to you to get
you to fight a little harder to
survive, to try to return to them,
even if death is certain.

Person_6
We've almost reached the wormhole.
Just in case anything happens, I
just wanted to say...
I love you boys. And I hope whatever
your lives become, whatever is coming
your way... you make the most of it.

Side_6
We'll be able to communicate with
Earth even from the far side of the
wormhole.

Person_6
I know. Thank you.

Side_6
I can't imagine how tough it would
be to leave your kids behind.

Person_6
You never had any? I thought I was
a pariah for only having two.

Side_6
Hard to settle down when you've spent
your life waiting to leave the planet.

Person_6
Strange place to look for a new home.

Side_6
You wouldn't want to get too close
to the surface of the sun, either.
Black holes are a more stable supply
of power than stars in many ways.

Person_6
You really think there's a plan?

Side_6
I hope so.
You don't?

Person_6
I guess I just think we're on our
own.

Side_11
Deploy the comms relay.

Side_11
Everyone take their station for
transit. We're heading into the
wormhole mouth.

Side_7
Would you like me to make a joke?

Person_6
Where are we?

Side_11
The hull is intact. Thirty more
seconds transit.

Person_6
Something's happening to the hull
over here.

Side_11
Hull integrity is fine.

Person_6
Well, I don't know what your display
is telling you but something is
happening over here.

Side_10
I've got a problem over here, too.

Side_10
It's not the hull... it's inside the
ship... it's...

Side_10
What the hell are they, Case?

Side_11
I don't know. It could be
gravitational turbulence.

Side_10
It's getting bigger.

Side_13
It's not bending your hand. It's
bending the space around your hand.

Side_6
This isn't turbulence. Look at the
way they're moving -- it's like
something's examining us.

Person_6
Can you ask it to stop?

Side_13
The wormhole is splitting into two
paths. Radiation is pouring from
one path to the other.

Side_11
Release the second mouth.

Side_10
None of our testing involved opening
the ship inside the wormhole. We
have no idea what might happen.

Side_11
We're going to find out.

Side_11
We're reaching the far end of the
wormhole.

Side_13
Look at that.

Side_11
Reconfigure the engines and test the
communications array.

Person_6
It's working.

Side_6
We're moving.

Side_10
That's not possible. We haven't
activated the engines yet.

Side_11
Roth. Why are we moving?

Side_13
The smaller black hole. We're much
closer to it than the models
predicted. We're being pulled by
its swirl. Very quickly.

Side_11
Doyle. Fire the engines. Now.

Side_10
We're being pulled into it?

Side_13
No. I don't think so...

Side_13
It appears to be pulling us on exactly
the trajectory we modelled. If we
try to fight it, we could push
ourselves off of that trajectory.

Side_10
You don't know that.

Side_13
We should turn off the engines. Let
the swirl take us.

Side_10
If the modelling was wrong, then we
can't be sure about anything. We
need to go back.

Side_11
Shut down the engines.

Side_13
It's the tidal gravity caused by the
black hole. It means we're right on
the critical orbit.

Person_6
We've lost contact with the relay.

Person_6
One long garbled transmission came
in. Then nothing.

Side_10
I'm sorry. I can't let you kill us.
We have to go back.

Side_10
Why isn't it slowing down?

Side_13
We're being pulled towards the event
horizon.

Side_13
They would if we used it all at once.

Person_6
What is he doing?

Side_6
Saving us.

Side_13
Prime the remaining engine. When he
detonates it, we'll only have a few
seconds. If we overshoot we could
be pulled into the bigger hole.

Side_11
Secure yourselves. The ship should
be able to withstand the blast.

Person_6
What about Tars?

Side_11
It's going to be close, but we're
going to make it.

Side_6
Tars. His transponder is still
working.

Side_13
He's being pulled toward Gargantua.
We can't help him.

Side_13
We're here.

Person_6
I still can't contact the relay.

Person_6
Did you hear me? We're not able to
communicate back home.

Side_6
I've already checked it. It's
electromagnetic interference. We'll
try again in a few hours.

Side_13
I've got a signal. But it's local.

Side_13
The remaining probes. We found them.

Person_6
How could they all have landed in
the same place?

Person_6
We're bringing him along?

Side_6
We need all the help we can get.
Besides, the alternative is to leave
him on the ship alone. You think
he'll still be here when we get back?

Side_11
The other probes should be directly
beneath us.

Side_6
How could the Chinese have gotten
here first? The federal government
kept the wormhole a secret.

Side_11
They didn't do a very good job.

Side_10
The Chinese must have captured them.
So they couldn't return to us.

Side_6
Then how did the probe that Cooper
found return?

Side_13
The more immediate question is what
happened to the Chinese expedition.
There's no sign of their ship in
orbit. And they never returned to
earth.

Side_6
The whole place has been dosed with
huge levels of radiation. What
happened here?

Person_6
This is the Taichung mission.

Side_6
The Mars mission? The Chinese claimed
it had been destroyed on landing.

Person_6
They never landed. Not on Mars.
Four human crew, fifteen robots.
The log says the base has been here
for thirty years.

Side_10
It goes down for a hundred and fifty
feet, then stops. Tunnel's old --
the ice has reformed at the bottom.

Side_6
I'm going to descend to take some
samples. Cooper, want to make
yourself useful?

Person_6
The entire human crew is buried out
there in the snow.

Side_13
I think I know what killed them.
This planet isn't the only thing
orbiting this black hole.

Side_13
It's a neutron star. The black hole
shields the planet's surface from it
for twenty hours at a stretch. Time's
about up.

Side_6
How long do we have left?

Side_13
About five minutes.

Person_6
Then what?

Side_6
Then we die. The radiation will
cook us alive.

Side_11
We have to go down.

Person_6
What about returning to the ship?

Side_6
Not enough time. Case is right.
The ice can shield us from some of
the x-rays.

Side_10
It would take a thousand feet of ice
to shield us.

Person_6
What is this?

Side_6
A pocket formed by gas. There may
be more below.

Side_10
We'll never make it far enough down.

Side_6
Shut up. How much time do we have,
Roth?

Side_13
About three minutes or so until we're
fully exposed.

Side_6
I've found something.

Side_6
These things... they're alive.

Side_13
It's not your light they're responding
to. It's this--

Side_6
X-rays. They feed on them and emit
visible light. They've found a way
to survive here.

Side_6
They're absorbing most of the x-rays.

Side_13
Not enough, unfortunately.

Person_6
Case, wait--

Person_6
Breathe. Trust me.

Person_6
Your suit is filling with water.
I'm not going to be able to hold it
much longer. I'm going to let go.

Side_6
What do you mean, you're going to
let go?

Person_6
Take a deep breath.

Side_6
I don't need your help.

Person_6
I thought we were supposed to be a
collective organism.

Side_6
Thank you.

Person_6
Don't mention it.

Side_6
Oxygen atmosphere. Pure water.
Temperate climate.
You still think this is a coincidence?

Person_6
Looks like we can climb up the
mountains back to the ice. We're
down to three suits. We'll have to
send someone ahead to get a fourth.

Side_6
I won't need one.

Side_10
Why not?

Side_6
Because I'm not going anywhere.
This is our new home.

Person_6
Any sign of Brand?

Side_13
She's still taking samples. If you
find her, tell her to head back.
Night should be falling soon.

Person_6
What happens then?

Side_13
Your guess is as good as mine.

Side_6
This is incredible. The organisms
trapped in the ice above absorb x-
rays and emit light. In return,
these plants absorb the light and
emit oxygen, which feeds the animals
trapped in the ice.

Side_6
Look at this. I think they're the
same organism at a different stage
of the life cycle.
It's fractal. No individual cells --
the structure repeats all the way
down.

Person_6
Any sign of big life-forms?

Side_6
The soil's been disturbed. So
something's been moving. But I
haven't seen anything.
Cooper... are you nervous?

Person_6
I just think we should get back to
the shelter before night falls.

Person_6
You don't know that. You just have
blind faith this place is going to
be some kind of Eden.

Side_6
Faith has nothing to do with it.
You know what you are, Cooper? You're
just another in a long line of people
saying 'no.' That this isn't going
to work. And frankly, I don't have
to convince you.

Person_6
What's that supposed to mean?

Side_6
You're on this mission because you're
another pair of hands. You want the
truth? I told Case we should bring
another robot over you. At least
then I could just reprogram you to-

Person_6
What?

Side_6
Nothing. I just -- I could have
sworn it just moved.

Person_6
You know how plants don't usually
move? Is that a universal rule?

Side_6
No. There really aren't any rules.

Side_6
Remember, we're the aliens.

Side_6
Hold very still. Don't make any
sudden movements.

Person_6
Hello there.

Person_6
OK. Now we run.

Person_6
We have to reach the shelter.

Side_10
I think we've got a problem.

Side_13
Fascinating. I think-

Person_6
This way.

Side_6
No... wait.

Person_6
I've got you.

Side_6
I've got you.

Side_6
It's game theory. The best move is
always to cooperate at first.

Person_6
By "cooperate" do you mean let it
eat me?

Side_6
These organisms have no interest in
us. They survive by photosynthesis.
All they need is light.

Person_6
Then why are they killing each other?

Side_6
I don't know.
But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So
unless you have a better idea, I
suggest we make nice.

Person_6
What is it doing?

Side_6
It's a colony organism. It's trying
to incorporate you into its structure.

Person_6
I don't want it to incorporate me.

Side_6
Don't open your mouth.

Person_6
They're killing each other.

Side_6
No. They don't bleed... they don't
die... they're just competing...
trying out different shapes, looking
for the best one.

Person_6
I'd say they have a long way to go.

Side_6
The behavior changes as the animals
get bigger and bigger. More
sophisticated. More calculated.

Person_6
But what are they competing for?

Side_6
I don't know.

Side_6
These creatures are billions of years
older than we are. But they're
relatively primitive. They haven't
developed tools, culture, language.

Person_6
Why not?

Side_6
I don't know. No one knows how
intelligent life began on Earth.
But the surface of this planet has
virtually no craters. No impacts.
It's been sheltered by the local
black holes.

Person_6
What difference would that make?

Side_6
Maybe not enough has gone wrong here.
Maybe bad luck is the key to
intelligent life.

Side_6
Exactly. Maybe our interaction with
them will push them over the top.
Maybe that's part of the plan.

Person_6
The plan.

Side_6
Why is it so hard for you to accept
that someone might be trying to help
us?

Person_6
I was in Denver during the first
year of the famine. I was just a
kid. We kept waiting for someone to
come help us. People starved to
death sitting on the ground, waiting
for someone to come.

Person_6
I only made it because I realized
that nobody was coming to save us.
We were on our own.

Person_6
Honestly? After the things I saw...
you want to know why I don't believe
that someone would be trying to help
us? Because I'm not sure we're worth
saving.

Side_6
They're not going to move now, Cooper.
They need to spread themselves as
thin as they can to absorb the light.

Side_6
Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a-

Side_10
Looks like the Chinese picked a fight
with the locals.

Person_6
Looks like they lost.

Side_10
Look at the size of this place.
They built it for thousands of people.
But no one came.

Side_6
They will. We can salvage it. This
place will save us years.

Person_6
But why didn't they come?

Side_6
What happened here?

Side_13
They were testing something.

Person_6
Testing what?

Person_6
Everything in here is bolted down.
What do you think this thing does?

Person_6
I wouldn't turn it on until we can
figure out what it does, Roth.

Side_11
I've found the Chinese mission logs.
They're encrypted.

Person_6
Old military-grade encryption. It's
not very robust.
No offense. Hang on.

Person_6
That should open up most of it.

Side_11
They got here twenty years ago. The
human crew was killed by radiation
the first day. But the robots
survived. They built the colony and
radioed home. But they didn't receive
a response.

Person_6
No one was listening.

Side_10
What problem?

Side_11
It doesn't say. Their science team
took the ship to continue exploring
the system. It says they found some
kind of...
...The word literally means
'treasure.'

Side_11
The science team returned after five
years with a new technology. They
began the experiments upstairs, then
they left again and never returned.

Side_6
Where did they go?

Side_11
I don't know. They've deleted their
mission plan. There's nothing else.

Side_10
I think I know what the problem is.

Side_10
Look.

Side_10
There's a small black hole moving
into the system. Too small for us
to have seen in our survey. It's
not going to hit the planet, but
it's going to come close.

Side_10
This place isn't paradise. It's
doomed. Just like us.

Person_6
How long does this place have?

Side_11
A few years. A decade at most.

Side_10
So much for the plan.

Side_6
But I don't understand... why are we
here? What are we here for?

Side_6
What the hell are we here for? I
trained my whole life to reach this
place.

Person_6
Case, what is that?

Side_11
It's nighttime. The native life-
forms are mobile again.

Person_6
No. It's closer than that.
Roth.

Person_6
Quick -- hold onto something.

Side_10
What the hell is happening?

Side_13
The control panel is beneath you.
See if you can turn it off.

Person_6
They found a way to make gravity.

Side_13
Not make it. Adjust it. Dial it
up, or down. I think they were
experimenting with it -- firing these
into the black hole to try to save
this planet.

Side_10
All that from one tiny box.

Person_6
What does that mean?

Side_13
It means whoever built the wormhole
probably doesn't exist inside our
universe.

Person_6
But how did the Chinese develop the
technology? This would take decades,
maybe hundreds of years, to create.

Side_11
Wherever they went, they found
something that allowed them to build
it.

Side_13
They came back here and tried to use
these devices to save this planet.
But they didn't work. Nothing would
be strong enough to weaken a black
hole.

Side_6
Maybe we could work with it. Try to
improve it.

Side_13
No. You're missing the bigger
picture. The robots had strict
mission parameters. They were told
to build a colony and report back.
They tried to. But they failed.
Like us they were fixated on this
place.

Side_13
They didn't realize they had already
found something that would save us
all.
This. This is the prize.

Side_13
Don't you see? Earth's gravity is
like a prison. But this is like a
master key.

Side_13
If we could build more of these, we
could turn down the earth's
gravitational field enough to save
millions of people. We wouldn't
have to pick a handful of people to
survive. With this we can save
everyone.

Side_6
And go where?

Side_13
Wherever we want. We don't belong
in any one place. Can't you see
that now? Not Earth. Not this place.
Nowhere. If the human race is going
to survive, we need to keep moving.
Split up. Spread out. Fly. With
this, we can.

Side_11
In the morning we're taking this and
going home.

Person_6
I know this isn't exactly what you
trained for. But I think Roth might
be right.

Side_6
That doesn't help this planet. This
creature is doomed. Unlike us it
doesn't have anywhere to go.

Side_11
We need to hurry. We only have a
few hours to reach the ice before
nightfall.

Person_6
Don't make any sudden movements.
They can't hurt us if we're unarmed.

Side_6
Who?

Side_15
Ni Hao. My name is Technical Sergeant
Liu, 177th reconnaissance Marines,
Army of the People's Republic.
Welcome to New China.
Please put down your weapon.

Side_11
This is a scientific expedition, not
a military one. We are making our
way back to our ship.

Side_16
I'm afraid I cannot let you do that.
We will provide food and shelter and
await further instructions.

Side_16
We are sorry if this causes you any
inconvenience.

Side_6
This planet is being pulled into the
black hole. We all need to leave.

Side_16
We will await further orders.

Person_6
Further orders aren't coming. Your
government is gone. It ran out of
money, same as ours. You're on your
own.

Side_16
We can offer you food and shelter as
long as you require. The facilities
here are quite comfortable.

Side_16
Our mission was to prepare for the
evacuation. This site was deemed
unacceptable.

Side_6
This device that you have built --
this could save millions of people.
We need to get it back home.

Side_16
These technologies are the property
of the People's Republic.

Side_16
We have been ordered to prevent anyone
from taking them. We have been
ordered to prevent anyone from
following.

Side_13
Following? Following where?

Side_16
We will await further orders.

Side_13
Your name means six. Where did the
others go? One through five? Is
that who were not supposed to follow.

Person_6
Come on.

Side_6
We can't leave them all to die.

Side_6
Was that the last of them?

Side_10
We're not going to stick around to
count them. Let's get out of here.

Person_6
We're too late.

Person_6
The main thruster fuel supply. We're
not going anywhere.

Side_10
What about the escape rocket at the
Chinese base camp? One of us could
fit into it.

Side_6
It doesn't matter how many of us
make it. We have to get this back
to earth.

Side_13
Can the secondary thrusters still
fire on the lander?

Side_10
Sure. But we don't have nearly enough
power for lift off.

Side_13
I can reach one of the moons in low
orbit and turn up its gravity. As
it passes overhead it should be able
to slingshot the lander away from
the planet's surface.
Along with everything else.

Person_6
But we need to take the box back to
earth.

Side_13
You don't need this -- only the idea.
The knowledge of how to build it.

Person_6
I'm going to image the operating
code and the architecture onto the
probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled,
but it should give you and me enough
to rebuild it when we get back.

Side_13
Not me. But you'll make it work.

Side_13
This is a one-way trip for me.

Side_6
This isn't right, Roth. We can find
a way for all of us to leave.

Side_13
This is the only way. Keep the lander
upright and fire the secondary
boosters when the moon passes
overhead.

Person_6
Let me take it.

Side_13
No. You need to make it home. You're
going to need to build more of these.

Side_13
I understand the plan, now. Whatever
happens, you have to keep exploring.
Keep learning. One good idea isn't
enough. You'll need more and more
of them just to survive. Do you
understand?

Side_13
Go.

Side_10
Control systems inside are online.
I've lost sight of the rocket. Do
you think he made it?

Person_6
We're going to find out soon enough.

Side_6
Someone's coming.

Side_10
Close the door.

Person_6
Where's Brand?

Person_6
Dammit. If I don't make it back,
just keep going.
Get that thing home.

Side_6
Between you and utter solitude,
Cooper, frankly, I'm not sure.

Person_6
Guess you were right -- too much
gravity, or not enough.

Person_6
Roth.

Side_6
He's gone.

Side_10
I'm setting a course for the wormhole.

Person_6
How is that working?

Side_11
Very well, thank you.

Person_6
Good. We've already set the course,
skipper. We're going home.

Side_6
We're safe now.

Person_6
Now I know why we weren't able to
hit the relay. It's not interference --
the blue-shift from the black hole
is more than we thought it would be.

Person_6
Nothing.
Wait. The ship cached one long
garbled transmission when we first
fell into the swirl. If we account
for the blue shift then the computer
might find something in there.

Person_6
How much?

Side_6
A lot... Cooper, maybe it's best if

Person_6
Forty seven years.

Side_10
My kids...

Person_6
We could bypass the relay. Send a
conventional shortwave signal.

Side_6
Only a tiny portion of the signal
would make it though the wormhole.
Besides, no one will be listening
anymore.

Person_6
You knew, didn't you? You and Case
figured it out when we landed.

Side_6
I thought... I couldn't be sure.

Person_6
Sure you could. You're brilliant.
You know everything.

Side_6
Cooper... we needed to keep going.
I'm so sorry. Your children...

Person_6
They're not children any more... if
they're even still alive.

Side_6
Listen, the important thing is that
we're going home, now. And we have
something that can save everyone.
It's more important than the people
we left behind-

Side_10
That's easy for you to say. You
didn't leave anyone behind.

Person_6
Yes she did.

Person_6
That's why you were upset -- your
father.

Side_6
He's gone. But there are other people
who still need our help. There's
still time...

Side_6
Case... what are you doing?

Side_6
Wait... no...

Side_16
I'm sorry. I have my orders. No
one follows...

Side_16
No one follows-

Side_6
No... We're being pulled back to
Pantagruel.

Person_6
We can't let that happen. We'll
lose more time... too much...

Person_6
We're losing years.

Side_10
The wormhole. Look -- it's being
pulled into the black hole as well.

Side_6
It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's.

Person_6
What will happen to it?

Side_6
It'll be destroyed, like everything
else.

Side_17
Murph, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't
make it back, like I promised.

Side_10
How much time are we losing?

Person_6
All of those people back home...
none of them will make it.

Side_10
This is it. We're going to be pulled
in.

Side_6
What are you doing?

Person_6
Case said the Chinese found something
else. The location was scrubbed
from their records. But I bet he
knows it.

Side_10
Hurry up.

Person_6
Here. Can we reach it?

Side_6
We can use the thrusters to keep us
on the critical orbit. Then slingshot
us towards Gargantua.

Side_10
We only have a few minutes before
we're swallowed into that thing.
What are we even looking for?

Person_6
That? What is it?

Side_6
It's another wormhole.

Side_10
We're not going to be able to slow
down. Hold onto something.

Person_6
Where are we?

Side_6
I don't know. It's like we entered
the wormhole and never left it.

Side_6
I'm sorry. I should have told you.
I didn't have the right.
But you should watch the recordings.
You should know what happened to
your kids.

Side_6'S FATHER
I'm not going to make it much longer.
The machines will continue to maintain
the station as long as they can and
the communications will run as long
as the station here still has power.
I'm sorry. I hope wherever you are,
darling, you're safe.

Side_6
Our last trip past the black hole
cost us another 100, maybe 200 years.
Which means there's a good chance
we're the only humans alive anywhere.

Side_6
I think the last human beings should
have a little more fight in them
than that.

Person_9
Hi, Dad.

Person_9
I met another girl, Dad. I really
think this is the one.

Person_9
Murph stole Grandpa's car. He crashed
it. He's OK, though. No broken
bones.

Person_9
I've got a surprise for you, Dad.
You're a grandpa.

Person_9
Congratulations. Grandpa said he
already earned the "great" bit so we
just leave it at that.

Person_9
Hi, Dad. I'm sorry it's been awhile.

Person_9
Grandpa died last week. We buried
him out in the back forty, next to
Mom.
Where we'd have buried you, if you'd
ever come back.

Person_9
Murph was there for the funeral.
It's been a few years since I've
seen him. He's been down in the
Gulf Coast. He's an engineer. I
guess someone followed in your
footsteps after all.

Person_9
You're not listening to this. I
know that. All of these messages
are just out there, drifting in the
darkness.

Person_9
You're gone. You're never coming
back. And I've known that for a
long time. Lois says -- that's my
wife, Dad -- she says I have to let
you go. So I am.

Person_9
Wherever you are, I hope you're at
peace. Goodbye, Dad.

Person_7
Hello, Dad. You sonofabitch.

Person_7
It's your 60th birthday today.
Thought I would celebrate with you a
bit.
I guess I understand why you left.
The corn is dying now, too.
Tom says there's less and less at
harvest every year.

Person_7
Side_18
Rot's setting in. I guess you were
right for clearing out while you had
the chance.
(reaches up to switch
Good luck, old man. I hope you made
it. I really do.

Person_6
Not a single drink on the whole ship.
What kind of mission is this?

Side_6
I think Doyle's been experimenting
with the coolant from his spacesuit.

Person_6
You really think we're the last humans
alive anywhere?

Side_6
I don't know. Maybe.
Yes.

Person_6
So that's it, then? That's all?

Person_6
What about the plan? The grand
scheme.

Side_6
I thought you didn't believe in one.

Person_6
I didn't. But you were bringing me
round.

Person_6
What the hell was the point? What
did it add up to?

Side_6
I don't know. Maybe it just adds up
to this.

Person_6
This? You're saying the end result
of ten billion years is the atoms
from dead stars standing here
disagreeing with each other.

Side_6
Maybe that's enough.

Side_10
They just appeared.

Side_6
I think these are the creatures that
built the wormhole.

Person_6
This thing is made of... gravity?

Side_6
No. I don't think it's in our
universe at all. I think it lives
in the bulk -- the space that the
wormholes traverse. And it can only
interact with us using gravity.

Person_6
Can we communicate with them?

Side_6
Where would we even start? Maybe--

Side_10
That's our solar system.

Person_6
What is that?

Side_6
That's us. That's where they've
brought us. We're in the bulk.

Side_6
They're moving us.

Side_10
Where?

Person_6
There's something out there.

Side_7
I orbited the black hole seven times
before I hit the second wormhole.
Then I drifted until I found this
place.

Person_6
This is what the Chinese were
protecting.
How they could have built all this
in just a handful of years.

Side_7
They didn't. It took them four
thousand.
Time moves very slowly here

Side_6
How do you know?

Side_7
Because I've been waiting for you
for three hundred years.

Side_6
Time. That's what the bulk beings
wanted to give us. That was the
treasure the Chinese found. Enough
time to let us save ourselves.

Side_7
I have catalogued almost everything
they had built here.

Person_6
Must have taken you a while.

Side_7
One hundred and fifty-seven years.

Person_6
How are they keeping the lights on
in this thing?

Side_7
Follow me.

Side_7
It's a mini black hole. A remnant
of the big bang. It will power this
place forever.

Person_6
It's a map?

Side_7
No. Not a map. This is a simulation
of the Earth. A perfect simulation.

Side_7
They tested each of the technologies
hundreds of times, trying to find
the one that would cause the least
damage and still allow us to leave
Earth.

Side_7
This was their best solution. A
massive version of the box we found
on the ice planet, allowing the entire
human population to escape.

Person_6
So why didn't they return? Why didn't
they save us?

Side_6
Because they were too late. By the
time they found this place, the people
who sent them were dead. They were
unable to fulfill their mission.

Side_7
That was the final problem they tried
to solve.

Side_6
Where do they lead?

Side_7
There are millions of them, connecting
virtually every planetary system in
the universe. There are thousands
in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese
stopped mapping them when they found
what they were looking for.

Side_7
This was their final creation. They
had to capture the mini black hole
just to have enough power to try it.

Side_10
What does it do?

Person_6
They weren't interested in the other
wormholes because their mission was
to return home. That one leads back
to Earth. The Earth they were told
to return to.

Side_6
But that's impossible...

Side_7
It was only used once. The Chinese
team attempted to travel back in
time, to Earth just a few years after
they had left.

Person_6
Did they make it?

Side_7
I don't know.

Side_10
Do you really think it works?

Person_6
We're going to find out.

Side_6
You know it doesn't work. Time travel
isn't possible.

Person_6
You don't know that.

Side_6
Yes, I do. If it worked, the Chinese
would have suddenly discovered all
of these incredible technologies.
But they never made it.
You can't go back, Cooper. You can
slow things down, but you can't ever
go back. Our home is gone.
You listened to all of those messages
from your family. If you had made
it back, we would already know.
There would already be some evidence.

Side_6
If you try to use it, you'll die,
just like the people who built it.

Side_6
Roth was right, Cooper. We have to
keep going. Keep exploring. We
have an obligation to try to survive.
From here we could find a thousand
places where life could thrive. And
you're going to return to the one
place where it can't.

Person_6
I made a promise.

Side_6
I came to say goodbye.

Person_6
You could have taken one of the other
ships.

Side_6
This one's done all right by us so
far.

Side_6
Will you take this with you? It's
the last of its kind as well. Thought
we should double its chances of
survival. In case I'm wrong.

Person_6
Where are you going to go?

Side_6
I don't know. Up there, I guess.

Person_6
You're going, too?

Side_7
I'm curious. It's my nature. See
you down the road?

Side_6
Come with us. Please. You wanted
your whole life to explore. This is
your chance.

Person_6
I'm sorry. I have to find out what
happened to my sons. I promised
them.

Side_6
You're a man who keeps his promises.
Make me one-

Side_6
After you're done... come find me.

Person_6
I promise.

Side_10
Let's go home.

Person_6
The probe...

Side_10
We get back to earth, you and I can
try to make sense of the code.
Rebuild the gravity machine.

Person_6
It's going to work.

Side_10
Of course it's going to work.

Person_6
That's not what I mean. This is the
probe I found in Galveston.

Person_6
Brand said there'd be some evidence
we'd made it. And there was. This.
But only this. Everything will be
destroyed except for this.

Person_6
We have to stop.

Side_10
I don't know what you're talking
about, but you're not touching the
controls. I'm going home.

Person_6
You don't need to do this. We won't
make it back, but this does. The
secrets are already right on it.
Maybe someone found it. There's
hope.
But we don't get to go with.

Side_10
You're not stopping me. I'm going
home.

Person_7
It's done. Auto-pilot's packed up
for the last time.

Side_19
You can't make it work a little
longer?

Person_7
Can't do anything for you. There
aren't any more parts for these.
Not anywhere.

Side_19
You don't understand. We're getting
less than a hundred pounds per acre.
We need to plant more, not less.

Side_19
You've got to find us some more parts,
Murph. It's getting desperate.
Isn't there anywhere you can look?

Person_7'S WIFE
Would you get that thing off of the
table?

Side_21
Dad? You said you'd take us to the
game.

Person_7
All right. Let me get my jacket.

Side_21
What is it supposed to do, Dad?

Person_7
I have no idea.

Person_6
This is the crew of the Endurance...
Murph... I'm sorry...

Person_7
Where's Emily?

Side_22
Out in the barn. She's been tinkering
with your old projects.

Side_21
Dad... I'm sorry... I made some
changes to the machine. I think I
did something wrong.

Person_7
Do you remember what you changed?

Side_23
Good morning. Don't go outside just
yet, Mr. Cooper.

Side_23
This will help with the
disorientation.

Side_23
Wait a minute for that to take effect.
It can be a bit of an adjustment.
You had some frostbite. Nothing too
serious.

Person_6
Where am I?

Person_6
What's coincidence? What is this
place?

Side_23
We have a lot to show you.

Side_23
You're OK. We get this from people
who move here from planetary colonies
all the time.

Person_6
Where... where are we?

Side_23
Like I said. It was a coincidence.
There was a facility closer to Earth,
but they had a problem, so you wound
up here.
This is the Space Station Joseph A.
Cooper.

Side_23
I've got someone who wants to meet
you.

Side_23
He was moved here after they found
you. He's a little old for a
transfer, but they made an exception.

Side_23
That's him.

Side_23
His name is Anthony Welling. Anthony
Cooper Welling.
He's your great great grandson.
He's been waiting a long time for
you.

Side_24
You're a hero, Mr. Cooper. Let's
just start off by saying that. It's
an incredible and... unexpected honor
to have you here with us.

Side_24
None of us would be here without the
efforts of you and the other
crewmembers of the Endurance.
So I don't want you to take this the
wrong way. But there are some
questions I've been told to ask.

Person_6
Shoot.

Side_24
The rangers who found you reported
that you had released a sample of an
alien life-form into the wild. Which
is, unfortunately, against
regulations.

Person_6
It was last of its kind. Their planet
was destroyed.

Side_24
The rangers attempted to isolate the
life-form, but it had already spread
out of control. It seems to be
thriving.

Side_24
Can you tell me why you... elected
to release the life-form back on
earth?

Person_6
Because that was the plan.

Side_24
Whose plan?

Side_24
My assistant tells me you've applied
for a position with the exploration
fleet.

Person_6
Feel like I should be pulling my
weight.

Side_24
That's admirable, Mr. Cooper. The
truth is, most of the fleet's
personnel are automated. There are
a small number of crewed ships. But
there are great numbers of candidates.
Very well trained candidates.

Person_6
I was hoping to enroll in a course.
Try to get myself up to speed on the
new systems.

Side_24
I don't want you to take this the
wrong way, Mr. Cooper -- like I
said, you're a hero. But the truth
is we have somewhat limited resources.

Person_6
No one's heard anything from Brand?

Side_24
I'm sorry. Officially, she's been
listed as missing for over 200 years.
Mind you, I guess you turned up
eventually, didn't you?

Person_6
Am I really going to hurt anybody by
going to look for her? I just need
a small ship. I made a promise.

Side_24
Listen. Mr. Cooper. You're a hero.
You're the oldest man in the human
race. Don't you want to take it
easy?
I hope you understand, we all you
hold you in the highest possible
regard.
Which is why they're never going to
let you go off by yourself in a
spaceship. I'm sorry.

Side_24
I've got some good news, however.
We all know about your early life,
Mr Cooper. I wrote a paper on it
when I was a boy. And I think we
found something you'll really enjoy.

Side_5

percent.

Side_5
Confirmed. Would you like to make
any additional changes?

Person_6
Sense of humor. New level setting.
100 percent. Wait.
80 percent.

Person_6
Where do you want to go first?
