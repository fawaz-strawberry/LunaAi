NAME: Person_2
Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,
old buddy, do you read me?

NAME: Person_1
Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

NAME: Person_2
Well, I finished my circle.  I
don't pick up any life readings.

NAME: Person_1
There isn't enough life on this
ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
The sensors are placed, I'm going
back.

NAME: Person_2
Right.  I'll see you shortly.
There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.  I want to check
it out.  It won't take long.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, steady girl.  What's the
matter?  You smell something?

NAME: Person_2
Aaargh!

NAME: Person_1
Chewie!

NAME: Person_1
All right, don't lose your temper.
I'll come right back and give you
a hand.

NAME: Side_1
Solo?

NAME: Person_1
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll
know if anything comes around.

NAME: Side_1
Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

NAME: Person_1
No.  He's checking out a meteorite
that hit near him.

NAME: Side_1
(indicates radar
screen)
With all the meteor activity in this
system, it's going to be difficult
to spot approaching ships.

NAME: Person_1
General, I've got to leave.  I
can't stay anymore.

NAME: Side_1
I'm sorry to hear that.

NAME: Person_1
Well, there's a price on my head.
If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
I'm a dead man.

NAME: Side_1
A death mark's not an easy thing
to live with.  You're a good
fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you, General.

NAME: Person_1
Well, Your Highness, I guess this
is it.

NAME: Person_3
That's right.

NAME: Person_1
Well, don't get all mushy on me.
So long, Princess.

NAME: Person_3
Han!

NAME: Person_1
Yes, Your Highnessness?

NAME: Person_3
I thought you decided to stay.

NAME: Person_1
Well, the bounty hunter we ran
into on Ord Mantell changed my
mind.

NAME: Person_3
Han, we need you!

NAME: Person_1
We?

NAME: Person_3
Yes.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, what about you need?

NAME: Person_3
I need?  I don't know what you're
talking about.

NAME: Person_1
(shakes his head,
fed up)
You probably don't.

NAME: Person_3
And what precisely am I supposed
to know?

NAME: Person_1
Come on!  You want me to stay
because of the way you feel about
me.

NAME: Person_3
Yes.  You're a great help to us.
You're a natural leader...

NAME: Person_1
No!  That's not it.  Come on.
Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

NAME: Person_3
You're imagining things.

NAME: Person_1
Am I?  Then why are you following
me?  Afraid I was going to leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

NAME: Person_3
I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

NAME: Person_1
I can arrange that.  You could use
a good kiss!

NAME: Person_4
Don't try to blame me.  I didn't
ask you to turn on the thermal
heater.  I merely commented that it
was freezing in the princess'
chamber.  But it's supposed to be
freezing.  How are we going to dry
out all her clothes?  I really don't
know.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, switch off.

NAME: Person_1
Why do you take this apart now?
I'm trying to get us out of here
and you pull both of these.

NAME: Person_4
Excuse me, sir.

NAME: Person_1
Put them back together right now.

NAME: Person_4
Might I have a word with you,
please?

NAME: Person_1
What do you want?

NAME: Person_4
Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
She's been trying to get you on
the communicator.

NAME: Person_1
I turned it off.  I don't want to
talk to her.

NAME: Person_4
Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering
about Master Luke.  He hasn't come
back yet.  She doesn't know where he
is.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know where he is.

NAME: Person_4
Nobody knows where he is.

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

NAME: Person_4
Well, uh, you see...

NAME: Person_1
Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

NAME: Person_4
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

NAME: Side_4
Yes, sir?

NAME: Person_1
Do you know where Commander
Skywalker is?

NAME: Side_4
I haven't seen him.  It's possible
he came in through the south entrance.

NAME: Person_1
It's possible?  Why don't you go
find out?  It's getting dark out there.

NAME: Side_4
Yes, sir.

NAME: Person_4
Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire
what's going on?

NAME: Person_1
Why not?

NAME: Person_4
Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,
let's find Princess Leia.  Between
ourselves, I think Master Luke is
in considerable danger.

NAME: Side_4
Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
come in through the south entrance.
He might have forgotten to check in.

NAME: Person_1
Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

NAME: Side_4
Not yet.  We're having some trouble
adapting them to the cold.

NAME: Person_1
Then we'll have to go out on
Tauntauns.

NAME: Side_4
Sir, the temperature's dropping too
rapidly.

NAME: Person_1
That's right.  And my friends out
in it.

NAME: Side_25
I'll cover sector twelve.  Have
com-control set screen alpha.

NAME: Side_4
Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
reach the first marker.

NAME: Person_1
Then I'll see you in hell!

NAME: Person_4
You must come along now, Artoo.
There's really nothing more we can
do.  And my joints are freezing up.

NAME: Person_4
Don't say thing like that!  Of
course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll
be quite all right.

NAME: Side_18
Sir, all the patrols are in.
There's still no contact from
Skywalker or Solo.

NAME: Person_4
Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
quite unable to pick up any signals,
although he does admit that his own
range is far too weak to abandon
all hope.

NAME: Side_14
Your Highness, there's nothing
more we can do tonight.  The shield
doors must be closed.

NAME: Side_14
Close the doors.

NAME: Side_18
Yes, sir.

NAME: Person_4
Artoo says the chances of survival
are seven hundred seventy-five...
to one.

NAME: Person_4
Actually, Artoo has been known to
make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry
about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll
be all right.  He's quite clever,
you know... for a human being.

NAME: Side_2
Luke... Luke.

NAME: Person_2
Ben?

NAME: Side_2
You will go to the Dagobah system.

NAME: Person_2
Dagobah system?

NAME: Side_2
There you will learn from Yoda,
the Jedi Master who instructed me.

NAME: Person_2
Ben... Ben.

NAME: Person_1
Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here.

NAME: Person_1
Not much time.

NAME: Person_2
Ben... Ben...

NAME: Person_1
Hang on, kid.

NAME: Person_2
Dagobah system...

NAME: Person_1
(reeling from the
odor)
Whew...

NAME: Person_2
Dagobah...

NAME: Person_1
This may smell bad, kid...

NAME: Person_2
Yoda...

NAME: Person_1
...but it will keep you warm...
til I get the shelter built.
(struggling to get
Luke inside the
carcass)
Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
on the outside!

NAME: Side_6
Echo Base... I've got something!  Not
much, but it could be a life form.

NAME: Side_6
This is Rogue Two.  this is Rogue
Two.  Captain Solo, so you copy?
Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
This is Rogue Two.

NAME: Person_1
(filtered over
Zev's receiver)
Good morning.  Nice of you guys
to drop by.

NAME: Side_6
Echo Base... this is Rogue Two.  I
found them.  Repeat, I found them.

NAME: Person_4
Master Luke, sir, it's so good
to see you fully functional again.

NAME: Person_4
Artoo expresses his relief, also.

NAME: Person_1
How are you feeling, kid?  You
don't look so bad to me.  In
fact, you look strong enough to
pull the ears off a Gundark.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks to you.

NAME: Person_1
That's two you owe me, junior.

NAME: Person_1
Well your Worship, looks like
you managed to keep me around for
a little while longer.

NAME: Person_3
I had nothing to do with it.  General
Rieekan thinks it's dangerous for
any ships to leave the system until
we've activated the energy shield.

NAME: Person_1
That's a good story.  I think you
just can't bear to let a gorgeous
guy like me out of your sight.

NAME: Person_3
I don't know where you get your
delusions, laser brain.

NAME: Person_1
Laugh it up, fuzzball.  But you
didn't see us alone in the south
passage.

NAME: Person_1
She expressed her true feelings
for me.

NAME: Person_3
My...!  Why, you stuck up,... half-
witted... scruffy-looking ...nerf-
herder!

NAME: Person_1
Who's scruffy-looking?
I must have hit pretty close to
the mark to get her all riled up
like that, huh, kid?

NAME: Person_3
Why, I guess you don't know
everything about women yet?

NAME: Side_15
Headquarters personnel, report to
command center.

NAME: Person_1
Take it easy.

NAME: Person_4
Excuse us, please.

NAME: Side_1
Princess... we have a visitor.

NAME: Side_1
We've picked up something outside
the base in zone twelve, moving
east.

NAME: SENIOR Side_16
It's metal.

NAME: Person_3
Then it couldn't be one of those
creatures that attacked Luke.

NAME: Person_1
It could be a speeder, one of ours.

NAME: SENIOR Side_16
No.  Wait - there's something very
weak coming through.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, I am fluent in six million
forms of communication.  This signal
is not used by the Alliance.  It
could be an Imperial code.

NAME: Person_1
It isn't friendly, whatever it is.
Come on, Chewie, let's check it out.

NAME: Side_1
Send Rogues Ten and Eleven to
station three-eight.

NAME: Person_1
Afraid there's not much left.

NAME: Person_3
What was it?

NAME: Person_1
Droid of some kind.  I didn't hit
it that hard.  It must have had a
self-destruct.

NAME: Person_3
An Imperial probe droid.

NAME: Person_1
It's a good bet the Empire knows
we're here.

NAME: Side_1
We'd better start the evacuation.

NAME: Person_8
Admiral.

NAME: Side_7
Yes, Captain

NAME: Person_8
I think we've got something, sir.
The report is only a fragment from
a probe droid in the Hoth system,
but it's the best lead we've had.

NAME: Side_7
We have thousands of probe droids
searching the galaxy.  I want proof,
not leads!

NAME: Person_8
The visuals indicate life readings.

NAME: Side_7
It could mean anything.  If we
followed every lead...

NAME: Person_8
But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed
to be devoid of human forms.

NAME: Person_6
You found something?

NAME: Person_8
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Person_6
(studying the image
on the console screen)
That's it.  The Rebels are there.

NAME: Side_7
My lord, there are so many uncharted
settlements.  It could be smugglers,
it could be...

NAME: Person_6
That is the system.  And I'm sure
Skywalker is with them.  Set your
course for the Hoth system.  General
Veers, prepare you men.

NAME: Side_26
Groups seven and ten will stay
behind to fly the speeders.  As
soon as each transport is loaded,
evacuation control will give
clearance for immediate launch.

NAME: Side_27
Right, sir.

NAME: Person_1
(into comlink, to
Chewie)
Okay, that's it.  Try it... Off!
Turn it off!  Turn it off!  Off!

NAME: Side_20
Sir, it will take quite a while
to evacuate the T-forty- sevens.

NAME: Person_2
Well, forget the heavy equipment.
There's plenty of time to get the
smaller modules on the transports.

NAME: Side_20
Take care, sir.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks.

NAME: Person_2
Chewie, take care of yourself,
okay?

NAME: Person_1
Hi, kid.
There's got to be a reason for
it.  Check it at the other end.
Wait a second.
You all right?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Be careful.

NAME: Person_2
You, too.

NAME: Side_16
General, there's a fleet of Star
Destroyers coming out of hyperspace
in sector four.

NAME: Side_1
Reroute all power to the energy
shield.  We've got to hold them till
all transports are away.  Prepare
for ground assault.

NAME: Person_6
What is it, General?

NAME: Side_5
My lord, the fleet has moves out
of light-speed.  Com-Scan has
detected an energy field protecting
an area around the sixth planet of
the Hoth system.  The field is
strong enough to deflect any
bombardment.

NAME: Person_6
The Rebels are alerted to our
presence.  Admiral Ozzel came out
of light-speed too close to the
system.

NAME: Side_5
He felt surprise was wiser...

NAME: Person_6
He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
General, prepare your troops for a
surface attack.

NAME: Side_5
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Side_7
Lord Vader, the fleet has moved
out of light-speed, and we're
preparing to... Aaagh!

NAME: Person_6
You have failed me for the last
time, Admiral.  Captain Piett.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Person_6
Make ready to land out troops beyond
the energy shield and deploy the
fleet so that nothing gets off that
system.  You are in command now,
Admiral Piett.

NAME: Person_8
Thank you, Lord Vader.

NAME: Person_3
All troop carriers will assemble
at the north entrance.  The heavy
transport ships will leave as
soon as they're loaded.  Only two
fighter escorts per ship.  The
energy shield can only be opened
for a short time, so you'll have
to stay very close to your transports.

NAME: Side_28
Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

NAME: Person_3
The ion cannon will fire several
shots to make sure that any enemy
ships will be out of your flight
path.  When you've gotten past the
energy shield, proceed directly to
the rendezvous point.  Understood?

NAME: Side_29
Right.  Okay.

NAME: Person_3
Good luck.

NAME: Side_14
Okay.  Everyone to your stations.
Let's go!

NAME: Side_1
Their primary target will be the
power generators.  Prepare to
open the shield.

NAME: Side_16
Sir, Rebel ships are coming into
our sector.

NAME: Side_30
Good.  Our first catch of the day.

NAME: WOMAN Side_16
Stand by, ion control... Fire!

NAME: Side_15
The first transport is away.

NAME: Side_10
Feeling all right, sir?

NAME: Person_2
Just like new, Dack.  How about
you?

NAME: Side_10
Right now I feel like I could take
on the whole Empire myself.

NAME: Person_2
(quietly, strapping
in)
I know what you mean.

NAME: Side_17
Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

NAME: Side_17
We have spotted Imperial walkers!

NAME: Side_16
Imperial walkers on the north
ridge.

NAME: Person_2
Echo station Five-Seven.  We're
on our way.

NAME: Person_2
All right, boys, keep tight now.

NAME: Side_10
Luke, I have no approach vector.
I'm not set.

NAME: Person_2
Steady, Dack.  Attack pattern
delta.  Go now!

NAME: Person_2
All right, I'm coming in.

NAME: Person_2
Hobbie, you still with me?

NAME: Person_2
That armor's too strong for
blasters.

NAME: Person_2
Rogue Group, use your harpoons
and tow cables.  Go for the legs.
It might be our only chance of
stopping them.
All right, stand by, Dack.

NAME: Side_10
Luke, we've got a malfunction in
fire control.  I'll have to cut in
the auxiliary.

NAME: Person_2
Just hang on.  Hang on, Dack.  Get
ready to fire that tow cable.

NAME: Person_2
Dack?  Dack!

NAME: Side_5
Yes, Lord Vader.  I've reached the
main power generator.  The shield
will be down in moments.  You may
start your landing.

NAME: Person_2
Rogue Three.

NAME: Side_3
Copy, Rogue Leader

NAME: Person_2
Wedge, I've lost my gunner.  You'll
have to make this shot.  I'll cover
for you.  Set your harpoon.  Follow
me on the next pass.

NAME: Side_3
Coming around, Rogue Leader.

NAME: Person_2
Steady, Rogue Two

NAME: Side_3
Activate harpoon.

NAME: Side_3
Good shot, Janson.

NAME: Side_3
One more pass.

NAME: Side_11
Coming around.  Once more.

NAME: Side_11
Once more.

NAME: Side_11
Cable out!  Let her go!

NAME: Side_3
Detach cable.

NAME: Side_11
Cable detached.

NAME: Side_17
Come on!

NAME: Side_3
Whooha!  That got him!

NAME: Person_2
I see it, Wedge.  Good work.

NAME: Side_1
I don't think we can protect two
transports at a time.

NAME: Person_3
It's risky, but we can't hold out
much longer.  We have no choice.

NAME: Side_1
Launch patrols.

NAME: Person_3
Evacuate remaining ground staff.

NAME: Person_1
No, no!  No!  This one goes there,
that one goes there.  Right?

NAME: Person_4
Artoo, you take good care of
Master Luke now, understand?  And
... do take good care of yourself.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.

NAME: Side_5
All troops will debark for ground
assault.  Prepare to target the
main generator.

NAME: Person_2
Rogue Two, are you all right?

NAME: Side_6
Yeah.  I'm with you, Rogue Leader.

NAME: Person_2
We'll set harpoon.  I'll cover for you.

NAME: Side_6
Coming around.

NAME: Person_2
Watch that cross fire, boys.

NAME: Side_6
Set for position three.
Steady.

NAME: Person_2
Stay tight and low.

NAME: Person_2
Hobbie, I've been hit!

NAME: Person_1
You all right?

NAME: Person_3
Why are you still here?

NAME: Person_1
I heard the command center had
been hit.

NAME: Person_3
You got your clearance to leave.

NAME: Person_1
Don't worry.  I'll leave.  First
I'm going to get you to your ship.

NAME: Person_4
Your Highness, we must take this
last transport.  It's our only hope.

NAME: Person_3
Send all troops in sector twelve
to the south slope to protect the
fighters.

NAME: Side_15
Imperial troops have entered the
base.

NAME: Person_1
Come on... that's it.

NAME: Person_3
Give the evacuation code signal.
And get to your transports!

NAME: HEAD Side_16
K-one-zero... all troops disengage.

NAME: Person_4
Oh!  Wait for me!

NAME: Side_33
Begin retreat!

NAME: SECOND Side_33
Fall back!

NAME: Side_5
Distance to power generators?

NAME: Side_35
One-seven, decimal two-eight.

NAME: Side_5
Target.  Maximum fire power.

NAME: Person_1
Transport, this is Solo.  Better
take off - I can't get to you.
I'll get the princess out on the
Falcon.

NAME: Person_4
But... but... but... where are
you going?  Uh... come back!!

NAME: Person_4
Wait!  Wait for me!  Wait!  Stop!

NAME: Person_4
How typical.

NAME: Person_1
Come on.

NAME: Person_1
Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're
going to be a permanent resident!

NAME: Person_4
Wait!  Wait!

NAME: Person_1
How's this?

NAME: Person_3
Would it helped if I got out and
pushed?

NAME: Person_1
It might.

NAME: Person_4
Captain Solo, Captain Solo... sir,
might I suggest that you...

NAME: Person_4
It can wait.

NAME: Person_3
This bucket of bolts is never going
to get us past that blockade.

NAME: Person_1
This baby's got a few surprises
left in her, sweetheart.

NAME: Person_1
Come on!  Come on!  Switch over.
Let's hope we don't have a burnout.

NAME: Person_1
See?

NAME: Person_3
Someday you're going to be wrong,
and I hope I'm there to see it.

NAME: Person_1
Punch it!

NAME: Person_2
Artoo!  Get her ready for takeoff.

NAME: Side_3
Good luck, Luke.  See you at
the rendezvous.

NAME: Person_2
Don't worry, Artoo.  We're going,
we're going.

NAME: Person_2
There's nothing wrong, Artoo.
I'm just setting a new course.

NAME: Person_2
We're not going to regroup with
the others.

NAME: Person_2
We're going to the Dagobah system.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, Artoo?

NAME: Person_2
That's all right.  I'd like to
keep it on manual control for a
while.

NAME: Person_1
I saw them!  I saw them!

NAME: Person_3
Saw what?

NAME: Person_1
Star Destroyers, two of them,
coming right at us.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, sir!  Might I suggest...

NAME: Person_1
Shut him up or shut him down!
Check the deflector shield!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, great.  Well, we can still
outmaneuver them.

NAME: Side_36
Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers can be seen
veering to the left.

NAME: Side_21
Take evasive action!

NAME: Person_1
Prepare to make the jump to light-
speed.

NAME: Person_4
But, sir!

NAME: Person_3
They're getting closer!

NAME: Person_1
(with a gleam in his
eye)
Oh yeah?  Watch this.

NAME: Person_3
Watch what?

NAME: Person_1
I think we're in trouble.

NAME: Person_4
If I may say so, sir, I noticed
earlier that the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged.  It's
impossible to go to light-speed!

NAME: Person_1
We're in trouble!

NAME: Person_1
Horizontal boosters...!
Alluvial dampers...!  Well that's
not it.
Bring me the hydrospanners!

NAME: Person_1
I don't know how we're going to
get out of this one.

NAME: Person_1
Oww!  Chewie!

NAME: Person_1
That was no laser blast!  Something
hit us.

NAME: Person_3
Han, get up here!

NAME: Person_1
Come on, Chewie!

NAME: Person_3
Asteroids!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, no!  Chewie, set two-seven-
one.

NAME: Person_3
What are you doing?  You're not
actually going into an asteroid
field?

NAME: Person_1
They'd be crazy to follow us,
wouldn't they?

NAME: Person_3
You don't have to do this to
impress me.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, the possibility of successfully
navigating an asteroid field is
approximately three thousand, seven
hundred and twenty to one.

NAME: Person_1
Never tell me the odds!

NAME: Person_1
You said you wanted to be around
when I made a mistake; well, this
could be it, sweetheart.

NAME: Person_3
I take it back.  We're going to
get pulverized if we stay out here
much longer.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not going to argue with that.

NAME: Person_4
Pulverized?

NAME: Person_1
I'm going in closer to one of
those big ones.

NAME: Person_3
Closer?

NAME: Person_4
Closer?!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, this is suicide!

NAME: Person_1
There.  That looks pretty good.

NAME: Person_3
What looks pretty good?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.  That'll do nicely.

NAME: Person_4
Excuse me, ma'am, but where are
we going?

NAME: Person_3
I hope you know what you're doing.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, me too.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, that's it.  Dagobah.

NAME: Person_2
No, I'm not going to change my
mind about this.
I'm not picking up any cities or
technology.  Massive life-form
readings, though.  There's something
alive down there...

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe
for droids.

NAME: Person_2
I know, I know!  All the scopes are
dead.  I can't see a thing!  Just
hang on, I'm going to start the
landing cycle...

NAME: Person_2
No, Artoo, you stay put.  I'll
have a look around.

NAME: Person_2
Artoo?

NAME: Person_2
Artoo!  Where are you?

NAME: Person_2
Artoo!  You be more careful.

NAME: Person_2
Artoo - that way!

NAME: Person_2
Artoo!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, no!  Are you all right?  Come
on.  You're lucky you don't taste
very good.  Anything broken?

NAME: Person_2
If you're saying coming here was
a bad idea, I'm beginning to agree
with you.  Oh, Artoo, what are we
doing here?  It's like... something
out of a dream, or, I don't know.
Maybe I'm just going crazy.

NAME: Person_6
Yes, Admiral?

NAME: Person_8
Our ships have sighted the
Millennium Falcon, lord.  But...
it has entered an asteroid field
and we cannot risk...

NAME: Person_6
Asteroids do not concern me,
Admiral.  I want that ship and
not excuses.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, lord.

NAME: Person_1
I'm going to shut down everything
but the emergency power systems.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,
but... does that include shutting
me down, too?

NAME: Person_1
No, I need you to talk to the
Falcon, find out what's wrong with
the hyperdrive.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, it's quite possible this
asteroid is not entirely stable.

NAME: Person_1
Not entirely stable?  I'm glad you're
here to tell us these things.  Chewie,
take the professor in the back and
plug him into the hyperdrive.

NAME: Person_4
Oh!  Sometimes I just don't
understand human behavior.  After
all, I'm only trying to do my job
in the most...

NAME: Person_3
Let go.

NAME: Person_1
Sshh!

NAME: Person_3
Let go, please.

NAME: Person_1
Don't get excited.

NAME: Person_3
Captain, being held by you isn't
quite enough to get me excited.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, sweetheart.  We haven't
got time for anything else.

NAME: Person_2
Ready for some power?  Okay.
Let's see now.  Put that in
there.  There you go.

NAME: Person_2
Now all I have to do is find this
Yoda... if he even exists.

NAME: Person_2
Still... there's something familiar
about this place.  I feel like...
I don't know...

NAME: Side_37
Feel like what?

NAME: Person_2
(looking at the
creature)
Like we're being watched!

NAME: Person_9
Away with your weapon!  I mean
you no harm.

NAME: Person_9
I am wondering, why are you here?

NAME: Person_2
I'm looking for someone.

NAME: Person_9
Looking?  Found someone, you have,
I would say, hmmm?

NAME: Person_2
(Trying to keep from
smiling)
Right.

NAME: Person_9
Help you I can.  Yes, mmmm.

NAME: Person_2
I don't think so.  I'm looking
for a great warrior.

NAME: Person_9
Ahhh!  A great warrior.
(laughs and shakes
his head)
Wars not make one great.

NAME: Person_2
Put that down.  Hey!  That's my
dinner!

NAME: Person_9
How you get so big, eating food
of this kind?

NAME: Person_2
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to
land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would,
but we can't, so why don't you just...

NAME: Person_9
Aww, cannot get your ship out?

NAME: Person_2
Hey, you could have broken this.
Don't do that.  Ohhh... you're
making a mess.  Hey, give me that!

NAME: Person_9
(retreating with
the lamp)
Mine!  Or I will help you not.

NAME: Person_2
I don't want your help.  I want
my lamp back.  I'll need it to
get out of this slimy mudhole.

NAME: Person_9
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.

NAME: Person_9
Ah, ah, ah!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, Artoo, let him have it!

NAME: Person_9
Mine!  Mine!

NAME: Person_2
Artoo!

NAME: Person_9
Mine!

NAME: Person_9
Mine!

NAME: Person_2
Now will you move along, little
fella?  We're got a lot of work
to do.

NAME: Person_9
No!  No, no!  Stay and help you,
I will.
Find your friend, hmm?

NAME: Person_2
I'm not looking for a friend.
I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

NAME: Person_9
Oohhh.  Jedi Master.  Yoda.  You
seek Yoda.

NAME: Person_2
You know him?

NAME: Person_9
Mmm.  Take you to him, I will.
Yes, yes.  But now, we must eat.
Come.  Good food.  Come.

NAME: Person_9
Come, come.

NAME: Person_2
Stay here and watch after the
camp, Artoo.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, where is Artoo when I need
him?

NAME: Person_4
Sir, I don't know where your ship
learned to communicate, but it
has the most peculiar dialect.  I
believe, sir, it says that the
power coupling on the negative
axis has been polarized.  I'm
afraid you'll have to replace it.

NAME: Person_1
Well, of course I'll have to replace
it.

NAME: Person_1
Here!  And Chewie...

NAME: Person_1
... I think we'd better replace
the negative power coupling.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Your Worship, I'm only
trying to help.

NAME: Person_3
Would you please stop calling me
that?

NAME: Person_1
Sure, Leia.

NAME: Person_3
Oh, you make it so difficult
sometimes.

NAME: Person_1
I do, I really do.  You could be
a little nicer, though.
(he watches her
reaction)
Come on, admit it.  Sometimes you
think I'm all right.

NAME: Person_3
Occasionally...
(a little smile,
haltingly)
... when you aren't acting like
a scoundrel.

NAME: Person_1
Scoundrel?  Scoundrel?  I like
the sound of that.

NAME: Person_3
Stop that.

NAME: Person_1
Stop what?

NAME: Person_3
Stop that!  My hands are dirty.

NAME: Person_1
My hands are dirty, too.  What
are you afraid of?

NAME: Person_3
(looking right
into his eyes)
Afraid?

NAME: Person_1
You're trembling.

NAME: Person_3
I'm not trembling.

NAME: Person_1
You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
There aren't enough scoundrels in
your life.

NAME: Person_3
I happen to like nice men.

NAME: Person_1
I'm a nice man.

NAME: Person_3
No, you're not.  You're...

NAME: Person_4
Sir, sir!  I've isolated the
reverse power flux coupling.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you.  Thank you very much.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

NAME: Side_8
... and that, Lord Vader, was the
last time they appeared in any of
our scopes.  Considering the amount
of damage we've sustained, they
must have been destroyed.

NAME: Person_6
No, Captain, they're alive.  I
want every ship available to
sweep the asteroid field until
they are found.

NAME: Person_8
Lord Vader.

NAME: Person_6
Yes, Admiral, what is it?

NAME: Person_8
The Emperor commands you make
contact with him.

NAME: Person_6
Move the ship out of the asteroid
field so that we can send a clear
transmission.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Person_6
What is thy bidding, my master?

NAME: Side_9
There is a great disturbance in
the Force.

NAME: Person_6
I have felt it.

NAME: Side_9
We have a new enemy - Luke
Skywalker.

NAME: Person_6
Yes, my master.

NAME: Side_9
He could destroy us.

NAME: Person_6
He's just a boy.  Obi-Wan can no
longer help him.

NAME: Side_9
The Force is strong with him.  The
son of Skywalker must not become a
Jedi.

NAME: Person_6
If he could be turned, he would
become a powerful ally.

NAME: Side_9
Yes.  Yes.  He would be a great
asset.  Can it be done?

NAME: Person_6
He will join us or die, my
master.

NAME: Person_2
Look, I'm sure it's delicious.
I just don't understand why we
can't see Yoda now.

NAME: Person_9
Patience!  For the Jedi it is
time to eat as well.  Eat, eat.
Hot.  Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

NAME: Person_2
How far away is Yoda?  Will it
take us long to get there?

NAME: Person_9
Not far.  Yoda not far.  Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
(tasting food from
the pot)
Rootleaf, I cook.  Why wish you
become Jedi?  Hm?

NAME: Person_2
Mostly because of my father, I
guess.

NAME: Person_9
Ah, your father.  Powerful Jedi
was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, come on.  How could you know
my father?  You don't even know
who I am.
Oh, I don't know what I'm doing
here.  We're wasting our time.

NAME: Person_9
I cannot teach him.  The boy has
no patience.

NAME: Side_2'S VOICE
He will learn patience.

NAME: Person_7
Hmmm.  Much anger in him, like his father.

NAME: Side_2'S VOICE
Was I any different when you
taught me?

NAME: Person_7
Hah.  He is not ready.

NAME: Person_2
Yoda!  I am ready.  I... Ben!  I
can be a Jedi.  Ben, tell him I'm
ready.

NAME: Person_7
Ready, are you?  What know you
of ready?  For eight hundred years
have I trained Jedi.  My own counsel
will I keep on who is to be trained!
A Jedi must have the deepest
commitment, the most serious mind.
(to the invisible
Ben, indicating Luke)
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away...
to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was.
Hmm?  What he was doing.  Hmph.
Adventure.  Heh!  Excitement.  Heh!
A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless!

NAME: Side_2'S VOICE
So was I, if you'll remember.

NAME: Person_7
He is too old.  Yes, too old to
begin the training.

NAME: Person_2
But I've learned so much.

NAME: Person_7
Will he finished what he begins?

NAME: Person_2
I won't fail you - I'm not afraid.

NAME: Person_7
(turns slowly toward
him)
Oh, you will be.  You will be.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

NAME: Person_1
I'm not really interested in your
opinion, Threepio.

NAME: Person_3
There's something out there.

NAME: Person_1
Where?

NAME: Person_3
Outside, in the cave.

NAME: Person_4
There it is.  Listen!  Listen!

NAME: Person_1
I'm going out there.

NAME: Person_3
Are you crazy?!

NAME: Person_1
I just got this bucket back
together.  I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

NAME: Person_3
Then I'm going with you.

NAME: Person_4
I think it might be better if I
stay here and guard the ship.
(hears another
mysterious noise)
Oh, no.

NAME: Person_3
This ground sure feels strange.
It doesn't feel like rock at all.

NAME: Person_1
There's an awful lot of moisture
in here.

NAME: Person_3
I don't know.  I have a bad feeling
about this.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Watch out!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, that's what I thought.
Mynock.  Chewie, check the rest
of the ship, make sure there
aren't any more attached.  They're
chewing on the power cables.

NAME: Person_3
Mynocks?

NAME: Person_1
Go on inside.  We'll clean them
off if there are any more.

NAME: Person_4
Ohhh!  Go away!  Go away!  Beastly
little thing.  Shoo!  Shoo!

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute...

NAME: Person_1
All right, Chewie, let's get
out of here!

NAME: Person_3
The Empire is still out there.
I don't think it's wise to...

NAME: Person_1
No time to discuss this in
committee.

NAME: Person_3
I am not a committee!

NAME: Person_3
You can't make the jump to light-
speed in this asteroid field...

NAME: Person_1
Sit down, sweetheart.  We're
taking off!

NAME: Person_4
Look!

NAME: Person_1
I see it, I see it.

NAME: Person_4
We're doomed!

NAME: Person_3
The cave is collapsing.

NAME: Person_1
This is no cave.

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_7
Run!  Yes.  A Jedi's strength
flows from the Force.  But beware
of the dark side.  Anger... fear...
aggression.  The dark side of
the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join
you in a fight.  If once you
start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did
Obi-Wan's apprentice.

NAME: Person_2
Vader.  Is the dark side stronger?

NAME: Person_7
No... no... no.  Quicker, easier,
more seductive.

NAME: Person_2
But how am I to know the good side
from the bad?

NAME: Person_7
You will know.  When you are calm,
at peace.  Passive.  A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and
defense, never for attack.

NAME: Person_2
But tell me why I can't...

NAME: Person_7
No, no, there is no why.  Nothing
more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.  Mmmmmmmm.

NAME: Person_2
There's something not right here.

NAME: Person_2
I feel cold, death.

NAME: Person_7
That place... is strong with the
dark side of the Force.  A domain
of evil it is.  In you must go.

NAME: Person_2
What's in there?

NAME: Person_7
Only what you take with you.

NAME: Person_7
Your weapons... you will not
need them.

NAME: Person_8
Bounty hunters.  We don't need
that scum.

NAME: FIRST Side_16
Yes, sir.

NAME: Person_8
Those Rebels won't escape us.

NAME: SECOND Side_16
Sir, we have a priority signal
from the Star Destroyer Avenger.

NAME: Person_8
Right.

NAME: Person_6
... there will be a substantial
reward for the one who finds the
Millennium Falcon.  You are free
to use any methods necessary, but
I want them alive.  No disintegrations.

NAME: Side_13
As you wish.

NAME: Person_8
Lord Vader!  My lord, we have
them.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, thank goodness we're coming
out of the asteroid field.

NAME: Person_1
Let's get out of here.  Ready for
light-speed?  One... two... three!

NAME: Person_1
It's not fair!

NAME: Person_1
The transfer circuits are working.
It's not my fault!

NAME: Person_3
(almost expecting
it)
No light-speed?

NAME: Person_1
It's not my fault.

NAME: Person_4
Sir, we just lost the main rear
deflector shield.  One more direct
hit on the back quarter and we're
done for.

NAME: Person_1
Turn her around.

NAME: Person_1
I said turn her around!  I'm
going to put all power in the
front shield.

NAME: Person_3
You're going to attack them?!

NAME: Person_4
Sir, the odds of surviving a
direct assault on an Imperial
Star Destroyer...

NAME: Person_3
Shut up!

NAME: Side_8
They're moving to attack
position!  Shields up!

NAME: Side_8
Track them.  They may come
around for another pass.

NAME: Side_22
Captain Needa, the ship no longer
appears on our scopes.

NAME: Side_8
They can't have disappeared.  No
ship that small has a cloaking
device.

NAME: Side_22
Well, there's no trace of them,
sir.

NAME: Side_23
Captain, Lord Vader demands an
update on the pursuit.

NAME: Side_8
Get a shuttle ready.  I shall
assume full responsibility for
losing them, and apologize to Lord
Vader. Meanwhile, continue to
scan the area.

NAME: Side_23
Yes, Captain Needa.

NAME: Person_7
Use the Force.  Yes...

NAME: Person_7
Now... the stone.  Feel it.

NAME: Person_7
Concentrate!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, no.  We'll never get it out
now.

NAME: Person_7
So certain are you.  Always with
you it cannot be done.  Hear you
nothing that I say?

NAME: Person_2
Master, moving stones around is
one thing.  This is totally
different.

NAME: Person_7
No!  No different!  Only different
in your mind.  You must unlearn
what you have learned.

NAME: Person_2
All right, I'll give it a try.

NAME: Person_7
No!  Try not.  Do.  Or do not.
There is no try.

NAME: Person_2
I can't.  It's too big.

NAME: Person_7
Size matters not.  Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?  Mmmm.

NAME: Person_7
And well you should not.  For my
ally in the Force.  And a powerful
ally it is.  Life creates it, makes
it grow.  Its energy surrounds us
and binds us.  Luminous beings
are we...
(Yoda pinches
Luke's shoulder)
... not this crude matter.
You must feel the Force around you.
Here, between you... me... the
tree... the rock... everywhere!
Yes, even between this land and
that ship!

NAME: Person_2
You want the impossible.

NAME: Person_2
I don't... I don't believe it.

NAME: Person_7
That is why you fail.

NAME: Person_6
Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

NAME: Person_8
Lord Vader, our ships have
completed their scan of the area
and found nothing.  If the
Millennium Falcon went into light-
speed, it'll be on the other side
of the galaxy by now.

NAME: Person_6
Alert all commands.  Calculate
every possible destination along
their last know trajectory.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, my lord.  We'll find them.

NAME: Person_6
Don't fail me again, Admiral.

NAME: Person_8
Alert all commands.  Deploy the fleet.

NAME: Person_4
Captain Solo, this time you have
gone too far.
No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

NAME: Person_1
The fleet is beginning to break
up.  Go back and stand by the
manual release for the landing claw.

NAME: Person_4
I really don't see how that is
going to help.  Surrender is a
perfectly acceptable alternative
in extreme circumstances.  The
Empire may be gracious enough...

NAME: Person_1
Thank you.

NAME: Person_3
What did you have in mind for
your next move?

NAME: Person_1
Well, if they follow standard
Imperial procedure, they'll dump
their garbage before they go to
light-speed, then we just float
away.

NAME: Person_3
With the rest of the garbage.
Then what?

NAME: Person_1
Then we've got to find a safe
port somewhere around here.  Got
any ideas?

NAME: Person_3
No.  Where are we?

NAME: Person_1
The Anoat system.

NAME: Person_3
Anoat system.  There's not much
there.

NAME: Person_1
No.  Well, wait.  This is
interesting.  Lando.

NAME: Person_3
Lando system?

NAME: Person_1
Lando's not a system, he's a man.
Lando Calrissian.  He's a card
player, gambler, scoundrel.  You'd
like him.

NAME: Person_3
Thanks.

NAME: Person_1
Bespin.  It's pretty far, but I
think we can make it.

NAME: Person_3
(reading from the
computer)
A mining colony?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine.  Lando
conned somebody out of it.  We
go back a long way, Lando and me.

NAME: Person_3
Can you trust him?

NAME: Person_1
No.  But he has no love for the
Empire, I can tell you that.

NAME: Person_1
Here we go, Chewie.  Stand by.
Detach!

NAME: Person_3
You do have your moments.  Not
many, but you have them.

NAME: Person_7
Concentrate... feel the Force
flow.  Yes.  Good.  Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you
will see.  Other places.  The
future... the past.  Old friends
long gone.

NAME: Person_2
Han!  Leia!

NAME: Person_7
Hmm.  Control, control.  You must
learn control.

NAME: Person_2
I saw... I saw a city in the
clouds.

NAME: Person_7
Mmm.  Friends you have there.

NAME: Person_2
They were in pain.

NAME: Person_7
It is the future you see.

NAME: Person_2
Future?  Will they die?

NAME: Person_7
Difficult to see.  Always in
motion is the future.

NAME: Person_2
I've got to go to them.

NAME: Person_7
Decide you must how to serve
them best.  If you leave now,
help them you could.  But you
would destroy all for which they
have fought and suffered.

NAME: Person_1
No, I don't have a landing
permit.  I'm trying to reach
Lando Calrissian.

NAME: Person_1
Whoa!  Wait a minute!  Let me
explain.

NAME: Side_24
You will not deviate from your
present course.

NAME: Person_4
Rather touchy, aren't they?

NAME: Person_3
I thought you knew this person.

NAME: Person_1
Well, that was a long time ago.
I'm sure he's forgotten about
that.

NAME: Side_24
Permission granted to land on
Platform Three-two-seven.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
There's nothing to worry about.
We go way back, Lando and me.

NAME: Person_3
Who's worried?

NAME: Person_4
Oh.  No one to meet us.

NAME: Person_3
I don't like this.

NAME: Person_1
Well, what would you like?

NAME: Person_4
Well, they did let us land.

NAME: Person_1
Look, don't worry.  Everything's
going to be fine.  Trust me.

NAME: Person_1
See?  My friend.
Keep your eyes open, okay?

NAME: Person_5
Why, you slimy, double-crossing,
no-good swindler!  You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after
what you pulled.

NAME: Person_5
How you doing, you old pirate?
So good to see you!  I never thought
I'd catch up with you again.  Where
you been?

NAME: Person_4
Well, he seems very friendly.

NAME: Person_3
Yes... very friendly.

NAME: Person_5
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_1
(gestures toward
the Falcon)
Ahh... repairs.  I thought you
could help me out.

NAME: Person_5
What have you done to my ship?

NAME: Person_1
Your ship?  Hey, remember, you
lost her to me fair and square.

NAME: Person_5
Hello.  What have we here?
Welcome.  I'm Lando Calrissian.
I'm the administrator of this
facility.  And who might you be?

NAME: Person_3
Leia.

NAME: Person_5
Welcome, Leia.

NAME: Person_1
All right, all right, you old
smoothie.

NAME: Person_4
Hello, sir.  I am See-Threepio,
human-cyborg relations.  My
facilities are at your...

NAME: Person_4
Well, really!

NAME: Person_5
What's wrong with the Falcon?

NAME: Person_1
Hyperdrive.

NAME: Person_5
I'll get my people to work on it.

NAME: Person_1
Good.

NAME: Person_5
You know, that ship saved my life
quite a few times.  She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

NAME: Person_1
How's the gas mine?  Is it
paying off for you?

NAME: Person_5
Oh, not as well as I'd like.
We're a small outpost and not
very self-sufficient.  And I've
had supply problems of every kind.
I've had labor difficulties...
(catches Han
grinning at him)
What's so funny?

NAME: Person_1
You.  Listen to you - you sound
like a businessman, a responsible
leader.  Who'd have thought that,
huh?

NAME: Person_5
You know, seeing you sure
brings back a few things.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah.  I'm responsible these days.
It's the price you pay for being
successful.

NAME: Person_4
Oh!  Nice to see a familiar face.

NAME: SECOND Person_4
E chu ta!

NAME: Person_4
How rude!

NAME: Person_4
That sounds like an R2 unit in
there.  I wonder if...

NAME: Person_4
Hello?  How interesting.  Oh, my.

NAME: Side_41
Who are you?

NAME: Person_4
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.  I... I
didn't mean to intrude.  No, no,
please don't get up.  No!

NAME: Person_7
Luke!  You must complete the
training.

NAME: Person_2
I can't keep the vision out of my
head.  They're my friends.  I've
got to help them.

NAME: Person_7
You must not go!

NAME: Person_2
But Han and Leia will die if I
don't.

NAME: Side_2'S VOICE
You don't know that.

NAME: Side_2
Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

NAME: Person_2
But I can help them!  I feel
the Force!

NAME: Side_2
But you cannot control it.  This
is a dangerous time for you,
when you will be tempted by the
dark side of the Force.

NAME: Person_7
Yes, yes.  To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.  Remember your failure
at the cave!

NAME: Person_2
But I've learned so much since
then.  Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun.
You have my word.

NAME: Side_2
It is you and your abilities the
Emperor wants.  that is why your
friends are made to suffer.

NAME: Person_2
And that is why I have to go.

NAME: Side_2
Luke, I don't want to lose you to
the Emperor the way I lost Vader.

NAME: Person_2
You won't.

NAME: Person_7
Stopped they must be.  On this
all depends.  Only a fully trained
Jedi Knight with the Force as his
ally will conquer Vader and his
Emperor.  If you end your training
now, if you choose the quick and
easy path, as Vader did, you will
become an agent of evil.

NAME: Side_2
Patience.

NAME: Person_2
And sacrifice Han and Leia?

NAME: Person_7
If you honor what they fight for
... yes!

NAME: Side_2
If you choose to face Vader, you
will do it alone.  I cannot
interfere.

NAME: Person_2
I understand.
(he moves to his
X-wing)
Artoo, fire up the converters.

NAME: Side_2
Luke, don't give in to hate -
that leads to the dark side.

NAME: Person_7
Strong is Vader.  Mind what you
have learned.  Save you it can.

NAME: Person_2
I will.  And I'll return.  I promise.

NAME: Person_7
Told you, I did.  Reckless is
he.  Now matters are worse.

NAME: Side_2
That boy is our last hope.

NAME: Person_7
No.  There is another.

NAME: Person_1
The ship is almost finished.
Two or Three more things and
we're in great shape.

NAME: Person_3
The sooner the better.  Something's
wrong here.  No one has seen or
knows anything about Threepio.
He's been gone too long to have
gotten lost.

NAME: Person_1
Relax.  I'll talk to Lando and
see what I can find out.

NAME: Person_3
I don't trust Lando.

NAME: Person_1
Well, I don't trust him, either.
But he is my friend.  Besides,
we'll soon be gone.

NAME: Person_3
And then you're as good as gone,
aren't you?

NAME: Person_3
What happened?

NAME: Person_1
Where?  Found him in a junk pile?

NAME: Person_3
Oh, what a mess.  Chewie, do you
think you can repair him?

NAME: Person_1
Lando's got people who can fix
him.

NAME: Person_3
No, thanks.

NAME: Person_5
I'm sorry.  Am I interrupting
anything?

NAME: Person_3
Not really.

NAME: Person_5
You look absolutely beautiful.
You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

NAME: Person_3
Thank you.

NAME: Person_5
Will you join me for a little
refreshment?

NAME: Person_5
Everyone's invited, of course.

NAME: Person_5
Having trouble with you droid?

NAME: Person_1
No.  No problem.  Why?

NAME: Person_5
So you see, since we're a small
operation, we don't fall into
the... uh... jurisdiction of the
Empire.

NAME: Person_3
So you're part of the mining
guild then?

NAME: Person_5
No, not actually.  Our operation
is small enough not to be noticed...
which is advantageous for everybody
since our customers are anxious
to avoid attracting attention to
themselves.

NAME: Person_1
Aren't you afraid the Empire's
going to find out about this
little operation and shut you down?

NAME: Person_5
That's always been a danger looming
like a shadow over everything we've
built here.  But things have
developed that will insure security.
I've just made a deal that will
keep the Empire out of here forever.

NAME: Person_6
We would be honored if you would
join us.

NAME: Person_5
I had no choice.  They arrived
right before you did.  I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, too.

NAME: Person_2
No, Threepio's with them.

NAME: Person_2
Just hang on.  We're almost there.

NAME: Person_4
Mmmm.  Oh, my.  Uh, I, uh - Take
this off!  I, uh, don't mean to
intrude here.  I, don't, no, no,
no... Please don't get up.  No!

NAME: Person_4
Stormtroopers?  Here?  We're in
danger.  I must tell the others.
Oh, no!  I've been shot!

NAME: Person_5
Lord Vader.

NAME: Person_6
You may take Captain Solo to
Jabba the Hut after I have
Skywalker.

NAME: Side_13
He's no good to me dead.

NAME: Person_6
He will not be permanently damaged.

NAME: Person_5
Lord Vader, what about Leia and
the Wookiee?

NAME: Person_6
They must never again leave this
city.

NAME: Person_5
That was never a condition of our
agreement, nor was giving Han to
this bounty hunter!

NAME: Person_6
Perhaps you think you're being
treated unfairly.

NAME: Person_5
No.

NAME: Person_6
Good.  It would be unfortunate if
I had to leave a garrison here.

NAME: Person_5
This deal's getting worse all
the time.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, yes, that's very good.  I like
that.  Oh!  Something's not right
because now I can't see.  Wait.
Wait!  Oh, my!  what have you done?
I'm backwards, you stupid furball.
Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

NAME: Person_1
I feel terrible.

NAME: Person_3
Why are they doing this?

NAME: Person_1
They never even asked me any
questions.

NAME: Person_3
Lando.

NAME: Person_1
Get out of here, Lando!

NAME: Person_5
Shut up and listen!  Vader has
agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
over to me.

NAME: Person_1
Over to you?

NAME: Person_5
They'll have to stay here, but at
least they'll be safe.

NAME: Person_3
What about Han?

NAME: Person_5
Vader's giving him to the bounty
hunter.

NAME: Person_3
Vader wants us all dead.

NAME: Person_5
He doesn't want you at all.  He's
after somebody called Skywalker.

NAME: Person_1
Luke?

NAME: Person_5
Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

NAME: Person_3
And we're the bait.

NAME: Person_5
Well, he's on his way.

NAME: Person_1
Perfect.  You fixed us all pretty
good, didn't you?
My friend!

NAME: Person_5
Stop!  I've done all I can.  I'm
sorry I couldn't do better, but
I have my own problems.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, you're a real hero.

NAME: Person_3
You certainly have a way with
people.

NAME: Person_6
This facility is crude, but it
should be adequate to freeze
Skywalker for his journey to the
Emperor.

NAME: Side_42
Lord Vader, ship approaching.
X-wing class.

NAME: Person_6
Good.  Monitor Skywalker and allow
him to land.

NAME: Person_5
Lord Vader, we only use this
facility for carbon freezing.  If
you put him in there, it might
kill him.

NAME: Person_6
I do not want the Emperor's prize
damaged.  We will test it... on
Captain Solo.

NAME: Person_4
If only you had attached my legs,
I wouldn't be in this ridiculous
position.  Now, remember, Chewbacca,
you have a responsibility to me,
so don't do anything foolish.

NAME: Person_1
What's going on... buddy?

NAME: Person_5
You're being put into carbon freeze.

NAME: Side_13
What if he doesn't survive?  He's
worth a lot to me.

NAME: Person_6
The Empire will compensate you
if he dies.  Put him in!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, no!  No, no, no!  Stop,
Chewbacca, stop...!

NAME: Person_1
Stop, Chewie, stop!  Do you hear
me?  Stop!

NAME: Person_4
Yes, stop, please!  I'm not ready
to die.

NAME: Person_1
Chewie!  Chewie, this won't help
me.  Hey!

NAME: Person_1
Save your strength.  There'll be
another time.  The princess - you
have to take care of her.  You
hear me?

NAME: Person_3
I love you!

NAME: Person_1
I know.

NAME: Person_4
What... what's going on?  Turn
round, Chewbacca, I can't see.
Oh... they've encased him in
carbonite.  He should be quite
well-protected - if he survives
the freezing process, that is.

NAME: Person_6
Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

NAME: Person_5
Yes, he's alive.  And in perfect
hibernation.

NAME: Person_6
He's all yours bounty hunter.
Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

NAME: Side_21
Skywalker has just landed, my
lord.

NAME: Person_6
Good.  See to it that he finds
his way here.  Calrissian, take
the princess and the Wookiee to
my ship.

NAME: Person_5
You said they'd be left in the
city under my supervision.

NAME: Person_6
I am altering the deal.  Pray I
don't alter it any further.

NAME: Person_3
Luke!  Luke, don't - it's a
trap!  It's a trap!

NAME: Person_6
The Force is with you, young
Skywalker.  But you are not a
Jedi yet.

NAME: Person_5
Well done.  Hold them in the
security tower - and keep it
quiet.  Move.

NAME: Person_3
What do you think you're doing?

NAME: Person_5
We're getting out of here.

NAME: Person_4
I knew all along it had to be a
mistake.

NAME: Person_3
Do you think that after what you
did to Han we're going to trust
you?

NAME: Person_5
I had no choice...

NAME: Person_4
What are you doing?  Trust him,
trust him!

NAME: Person_3
Oh, so we understand, don't we,
Chewie?  He had no choice.

NAME: Person_5
I'm just trying to help...

NAME: Person_3
We don't need any of your help.

NAME: Person_5
H-a-a-a...

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_4
It sounds like Han.

NAME: Person_5
There's still a chance to save
Han... I mean, at the East
Platform...

NAME: Person_3
Chewie.

NAME: Person_4
I'm terribly sorry about all this.
After all, he's only a Wookiee.

NAME: Side_13
Put Captain Solo in the cargo
hold.

NAME: Person_4
Artoo!  Artoo!  Where have you
been?

NAME: Person_4
Turn around, you wooly...!
Hurry, hurry!  We're trying to
save Han from the bounty hunter!

NAME: Person_4
Well, at least your still in
one piece!  Look what happened to
me!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, no!  Chewie, they're behind
you!

NAME: Person_6
You have learned much, young one.

NAME: Person_2
You'll find I'm full of surprises.

NAME: Person_6
Your destiny lies with me,
Skywalker.  Obi-Wan knew this to
be true.

NAME: Person_2
No!

NAME: Person_6
All to easy.  Perhaps you are not
as strong as the Emperor thought.

NAME: Person_6
Impressive... most impressive.

NAME: Person_6
Obi-Wan has taught you well.  You
have controlled your fear... now
release your anger.

NAME: Person_6
Only your hatred can destroy me.

NAME: Person_5
The security codes has been changed!

NAME: Person_4
Artoo, you can tell the computer
to override the security system.

NAME: Person_5
Attention!  This is Lando
Calrissian.  The Empire has takes
control of the city.  I advise
everyone to leave before more
Imperial troops arrive.

NAME: Person_5
This way.

NAME: Person_4
Don't blame me.  I'm an interpreter.
I'm not supposed to know a power
socket from a computer terminal.

NAME: Person_4
What are you talking about?  We're
not interested in the hyperdrive
on the Millennium Falcon.  It's
fixed!  Just open the door, you
stupid lump.

NAME: Person_4
I never doubted you for a second.
Wonderful!

NAME: Person_4
Ouch!  Oh!  Ah!  That hurt.  Bend
down, you thoughtless... Ow!

NAME: Person_5
Leia!  Go!

NAME: Person_4
I thought that hairy beast would
be the end of me.  Of course, I've
looked better.

NAME: Person_6
You are beaten.  It is useless
to resist.  Don't let yourself
be destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

NAME: Person_6
There is no escape.  Don't make
me destroy you.  You do not yet
realize your importance.  You
have only begun to discover your
power.  Join me and I will complete
your training.  With our combined
strength, we can end this destructive
conflict and bring order to the
galaxy.

NAME: Person_2
I'll never join you!

NAME: Person_6
If you only knew the power of the
dark side.  Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father.

NAME: Person_2
He told me enough!  It was you
who killed him.

NAME: Person_6
No.  I am your father.

NAME: Person_2
No.  No.  That's not true!
That's impossible!

NAME: Person_6
Search your feelings.  You know
it to be true.

NAME: Person_2
No!  No!  No!

NAME: Person_6
Luke.  You can destroy the Emperor.
He has foreseen this.  It is your
destiny.  Join me, and together
we can rule the galaxy as father
and son.  Come with me.  It is the
only way.

NAME: Person_2
Ben... Ben, please!

NAME: Person_2
Ben.  Leia!

NAME: Person_2
Hear me!  Leia!

NAME: Person_3
Luke... We've got to go back.

NAME: Person_5
What?

NAME: Person_3
I know where Luke is.

NAME: Person_5
But what about those fighter?

NAME: Person_3
Chewie, just do it.

NAME: Person_5
But what about Vader?

NAME: Person_5
All right, all right, all right.

NAME: Person_6
Bring my shuttle.

NAME: Person_5
(pointing out the
cockpit window)
Look, someone's up there.

NAME: Person_3
It's Luke.  Chewie, slow down.
Slow down and we'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

NAME: Person_3
Okay.  Easy, Chewie.

NAME: Person_3
Lando?

NAME: Person_5
Okay, let's go.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, Leia.

NAME: Person_5
All right, Chewie.  Let's go.

NAME: Person_3
I'll be back.

NAME: Person_3
Star Destroyer.

NAME: Person_5
All right, Chewie.  Ready for
light-speed.

NAME: Person_3
If your people fixed the
hyperdrive.

NAME: Person_3
All the coordinates are set.
It's now or never.

NAME: Person_5
Punch it!

NAME: Person_5
They told me they fixed it.  I
trusted them to fix it.  It's not
my fault!

NAME: Person_8
They'll be in range of our
tractor beam in moments, my lord.

NAME: Person_6
Did your men deactivate the
hyperdrive on the Millennium
Falcon?

NAME: Person_8
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Person_6
Good.  Prepare the boarding party
and set your weapons for stun.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Person_4
Noisy brute.  Why don't we just
go into light-speed?

NAME: Person_4
We can't?  How would you know the
hyperdrive is deactivated?

NAME: Person_4
The city's central computer told
you?  Artoo-Detoo, you know better
than to trust a strange computer.
Ouch!  Pay attention to what
you're doing!

NAME: Person_6
Luke.

NAME: Person_2
Father.

NAME: Person_6
Son, come with me.

NAME: Person_2
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

NAME: Person_5
Chewie!

NAME: Person_2
It's Vader.

NAME: Person_6
Luke... it is your destiny.

NAME: Person_2
Ben, why didn't you tell me?

NAME: Person_8
Alert all commands.  Ready for
the tractor beam.

NAME: Person_4
Artoo, come back at once!  You
haven't finished with me yet!
You don't know how to fix the
hyperdrive.  Chewbacca can do
it.  I'm standing here in pieces,
and you're having delusions of
grandeur!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, you did it!

NAME: Person_5
Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

NAME: Person_2
Good luck, Lando

NAME: Person_5
When we find Jabba the Hut and
that bounty hunter, we'll contact
you.

NAME: Person_2
I'll meet you at the rendezvous
point on Tatooine.

NAME: Person_5
Princess, we'll find Han.  I
promise.

NAME: Person_2
Chewie, I'll be waiting for your
signal.

NAME: Person_2
Take care, you two.  May the
Force be with you.

NAME: Person_2
Ow!

NAME: Side_9
June 3, 2008

NAME: Side_10
I see you like to CHEW!
Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!

NAME: Side_4
Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!

NAME: Side_11
And ATTRACTIVE!

NAME: Side_12
How can we repay you??

NAME: Side_4
There is no charge for awesomeness,
or attractiveness.

NAME: Side_3
We should hang out.

NAME: Side_4
Agreed.

NAME: Side_3
Po! Get up!

NAME: Person_5
You'll be late for work!

NAME: Person_1
Whu?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD (O.S.)
Po! What are you doing up there?

NAME: Person_1
Uh, nothing!

NAME: Person_1
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
Tigress! Rowrrrr...

NAME: Person_1
Coming!

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, Dad.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
What were you doing up there? All
that noise.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
dream.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
About what?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
The dream. What were you dreaming
about?

NAME: Person_1
What was I... eh, I was dreaming
about uh... heh...

NAME: Person_1
Noodles.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Noodles. You were really dreaming
about noodles?

NAME: Person_1
Uh, yeah. What else would I be
dreaming about?

NAME: Person_1
Careful, that soup is... sharp!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Oh, happy day! My son, finally
having the noodle dream!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
You don't know how long I have been
waiting for this moment.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
This is a sign, Po!

NAME: Person_1
Uh...a sign of what?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
You are almost ready to be
entrusted with the secret
ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
Soup." And then you will fulfill
your destiny and take over the
restaurant, just as I took it over
from my father, who took it over
from his father, who won it from a
friend in a game of mahjong.

NAME: Person_1
Dad Dad Dad, it was just a dream.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
No, it was the dream. We are noodle
folk. Broth runs through our veins.

NAME: Person_1
But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
want to do something else?
Something besides noodles?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Actually...

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
When I was young and crazy...

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
I thought about running away and
learning how to make tofu.

NAME: Person_1
So why didn't you?!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
Can you imagine, me making tofu?
No. We all have our place in this
world. Mine is here. And yours is--

NAME: Person_1
I know. Is here.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
No, it's at tables two, five,
seven, and twelve.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Service with a smile!

NAME: Person_2
Well done, students... if you were
trying to disappoint me.

NAME: Person_2
Tigress, you need more ferocity.
Monkey, greater speed.

NAME: Person_2
Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
Mantis--

NAME: Person_7
Master Shifu!

NAME: Person_2
What?!

NAME: Person_7
Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
to see you.

NAME: Person_2
Master Oogway? You summoned me.

NAME: Person_2
Is something wrong?

NAME: Person_4
Why must something be wrong for me
to want to see my old friend?

NAME: Person_2
So... nothing's wrong?

NAME: Person_4
Well, I didn't say that.

NAME: Person_2
You were saying?

NAME: Person_4
I have had a vision... Tai Lung
will return.

NAME: Person_2
That is impossible. He is in
prison.

NAME: Person_4
Nothing is impossible.

NAME: Person_2
Zeng!

NAME: Person_2
Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
to double the guards, double their
weapons. Double everything! Tai
Lung does not leave that prison!

NAME: Person_7
Yes, Master Shifu.

NAME: Person_4
One often meets his destiny on the
road he takes to avoid it.

NAME: Person_2
We have to do something. We can't
just let him march on the valley,
and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--

NAME: Person_4
Your mind is like this water, my
friend. When it is agitated, it
becomes difficult to see. But if
you allow it to settle, the answer
becomes clear.

NAME: Person_2
The Dragon Scroll...

NAME: Person_4
It is time.

NAME: Person_2
But who? Who is worthy to be
trusted with the secret to
limitless power? To become...the
Dragon Warrior?!

NAME: Person_4
I don't know.

NAME: Person_1
Oop...sorry.

NAME: Side_14
Hey! Watch it, Po!

NAME: Person_1
Sorry. Suck it up.

NAME: Side_15
Ugh!

NAME: Person_1
Oop! Sorry! A thousand pardons.

NAME: Person_1
What?! Master Oogway's choosing the
Dragon Warrior! Today!

NAME: Person_1
Everyone! Everyone! Go! Get to the
Jade Palace!

NAME: Person_1
One of the Five is gonna get the
Dragon Scroll!

NAME: Person_1
We've been waiting a thousand years
for this! Just take the bowl!

NAME: Person_1
This is the greatest day in Kung Fu
history! Don't worry about it, just
go!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Po! Where are you going?

NAME: Person_1
To the...Jade Palace?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
But you're forgetting your noodle
cart! The whole valley will be
there, and you'll sell noodles to
all of them.

NAME: Person_1
Selling noodles? But Dad, you know,
I was kinda thinking maybe I...

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Yeah?

NAME: Person_1
I was kinda thinking maybe I...

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Uh huh?

NAME: Person_1
...Could also sell the bean buns.
They are about to go bad.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
That's my boy! I told you that
dream was a sign!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, ha ha, glad I had it.

NAME: Person_1
Come on! Come on, ya-- Almost
there...

NAME: Person_1
What? No! Oh No!

NAME: Side_6
Sorry, Po.

NAME: Side_7
We'll bring you back a souvenir.

NAME: Person_1
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

NAME: Person_2
It is an historic day, isn't it,
Master Oogway?

NAME: Person_4
Yes, and one I feared I would not
live to see. Are your students
ready?

NAME: Person_2
Yes, Master Oogway.

NAME: Person_4
Now know this, old friend. Whomever
I choose will not only bring peace
to the Valley, but also to you.

NAME: Side_16
Let the tournament begin!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah!

NAME: Person_1
Oh no! No no no! Wait! I'm coming!

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Open the door!

NAME: Person_1
Let me in!

NAME: Person_2
Citizens of the Valley of Peace! It
is my great honor to present to
you... Tigress! Viper! Crane!
Monkey! Mantis! The Furious Five!

NAME: Person_1
The Furious Five!

NAME: Person_2
Warriors prepare!

NAME: Person_1
Peeky-hole!

NAME: Person_2
Ready for battle!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah! Woo! The Thousand Tongues of
Fire!

NAME: Side_17
Whoa! Look at that.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, get out of the way!

NAME: Person_1
Ow...

NAME: Person_2
And finally...Master Tigress!

NAME: Person_2 (O.S.)
And believe me citizens, you have
not seen anything yet!

NAME: Person_4
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among
us.

NAME: Person_2
Citizens of the Valley of Peace!
Master Oogway will now choose...
the Dragon Warrior!

NAME: Person_1
Huh? Oh no! Wait!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
What are you doing?

NAME: Person_1
What does it look like I'm doing?
Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the
Dragon Warrior!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
But I don't understand. You finally
had the noodle dream.

NAME: Person_1
I lied. I don't dream about
noodles, Dad!

NAME: Person_1
I love kung fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu-

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Come on, son. Let's get back to
work.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Oh! Come back!

NAME: Side_8
Oooh! Aaahh!

NAME: Person_1
Uh oh...

NAME: Person_1
What's going on? Where...uh? What
are you pointing--?

NAME: Person_1
Oh. Okay. Sorry. I just wanted to
see who the Dragon Warrior was.

NAME: Person_4
How interesting.

NAME: Person_5
Master, are you pointing at...me?

NAME: Person_4
Him.

NAME: Person_1
Who--?

NAME: Person_4
You.

NAME: Person_1
Me?

NAME: Person_4
The universe has brought us the
Dragon Warrior!

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Side_5
What??

NAME: Person_2
What???

NAME: Person_2
Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?

NAME: Person_2
Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
panda can't possibly be the answer
to... our problem. You were about
to point at Tigress. That thing
fell in front of her. That was just
an accident!

NAME: Person_4
There are no accidents.

NAME: Person_5
Forgive us, Master. We have failed
you.

NAME: Person_2
No. If the panda has not quit by
morning, then I will have failed
you.

NAME: Person_7
Wait wait wait! I bring a message
from Master Shifu.

NAME: Person_8
What?!?!
"Double the guard?! Extra
precautions?! Your prison may not
be adequate!"

NAME: Person_8
You doubt my prison's security?

NAME: Person_7
Absolutely not.
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

NAME: Person_8
I'll give you a message for your
Master Shifu.

NAME: Person_8
Escape from Chogun Prison is
impossible!

NAME: Person_7
Whoa.

NAME: Person_8
Impressive, isn't it?

NAME: Person_7
Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
impressive.

NAME: Person_8
One way in, one way out, one
thousand guards, and one prisoner.

NAME: Person_7
Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
Lung...

NAME: Person_8
Take us down.

NAME: Person_7
What are you doing?!

NAME: Person_7
Oh my...

NAME: Person_8
Behold, Tai Lung.

NAME: Person_7
I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
here.

NAME: Person_8
It's nothing to worry about. It's
perfectly safe.

NAME: Person_7
Oof!

NAME: Person_8
Crossbows! At the ready!

NAME: Person_7
Crossbows?!

NAME: Person_8
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
Oogway's finally gonna give someone
the Dragon Scroll and it's not
gonna be you!

NAME: Person_7
What are you doing?! Don't get him
mad.

NAME: Person_8
What's he gonna do about it? I've
got him completely immobilized.

NAME: Person_8
Awww. Did I step on the witty
kitty's tail? Awww.

NAME: Person_7
I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
to worry about.

NAME: Person_8
No, he doesn't.

NAME: Person_7
Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
please go now?

NAME: Side_8
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

NAME: Person_1
Wait a second! Hello? Uh...I think
there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm,
uh...

NAME: Person_1
Whoa. The Sacred Hall of Warriors.
No way! Would you look at this
place!

NAME: Person_1
Nooo! Ohhhh!

NAME: Person_1
The legendary Urn of Whispering
Warriors! Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu army.
Hellooo?

NAME: Person_2
Have you finished sight-seeing?

NAME: Person_1
Sorry. I should've come to see you
first.

NAME: Person_2
My patience is wearing thin.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

NAME: Person_2
Would you turn around?

NAME: Person_1
Sure.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, how's it going?

NAME: Person_1
Now how do you get five thousand--
Master Shifu!

NAME: Person_1
Someone...broke that. But I'm gonna
fix it. Do you have some glue?

NAME: Person_1
Ow! Ooh. Splinter.

NAME: Person_2
So you're the legendary Dragon
Warrior. Hmmm?

NAME: Person_1
Uh...I guess so?

NAME: Person_2
Wrong! You are not the Dragon
Warrior. You will never be the
Dragon Warrior until you have
learned the secret of the Dragon
Scroll.

NAME: Person_1
Whoa.
So how does this work? You have a
ladder or trampoline or...?

NAME: Person_2
You think it's that easy? That I am
just going to hand you the secret
to limitless power?

NAME: Person_1
No, I...

NAME: Person_2
One must first master the highest
level of kung fu. And that is
clearly impossible if that one is
someone like you.

NAME: Person_1
Someone like me?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. Look at you...this fat butt.

NAME: Person_2
Flabby arms...

NAME: Person_1
Those are sensitive in the flabby
parts.

NAME: Person_2
And this ridiculous belly.

NAME: Person_1
Hey...

NAME: Person_2
--and utter disregard for personal
hygiene.

NAME: Person_1
Now wait a minute. That's a little
uncalled-for.

NAME: Person_2
Don't stand that close...I can
smell your breath.

NAME: Person_1
Listen...Oogway said that I was the-

NAME: Person_1
The Wuxi Finger Hold?! Not the Wuxi
Finger Hold!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, you know this hold?

NAME: Person_1
DevelopedbyMasterWuxiInTheThirdDyna
sty-- YES.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, then you must know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

NAME: Person_1
No no no!

NAME: Person_2
You know the hardest part of this?
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards...

NAME: Person_1
Okay! Okay! Take it easy...

NAME: Person_2
Now listen closely, panda. Oogway
may have picked you, but when I'm
through with you, I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't. Are
we clear?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, we're clear. We're clear. We
are so clear.

NAME: Person_2
Good. I can't wait to get started.

NAME: Person_2
Let's begin.

NAME: Person_1
Wait wait wait...What? Now?

NAME: Person_2
Yes...now. Unless you think the
great Oogway was wrong, and you are
not the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, okay. Well-- I don't know if I
can do all of those moves.

NAME: Person_2
Well, if we don't try, we'll never
know will we?

NAME: Person_1
Uh, yeah. It's just, maybe we can
find something more suited to my
level.

NAME: Person_2
And what level is that?

NAME: Person_1
Well, ya know...I'm not a master,
but uh, let's just start at zero,
level zero.

NAME: Person_2
There is no such thing as level
zero.

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Maybe I can start with that.

NAME: Person_2
That? We use that for training
children. And for propping the door
open when it's hot. But if you
insist...

NAME: Person_1
Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so
much bigger than your action
figures -- except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

NAME: Person_2
Go ahead, panda. Show us what you
can do.

NAME: Person_1
Um, are they gonna watch? Or should
I just wait until they get back to
work or something...

NAME: Person_2
Hit it.

NAME: Person_1
Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm
still digesting... So my kung fu
might not be as good as later on.

NAME: Person_2
Just hit it.

NAME: Person_1
Alright. Whatcha got? You got
nothing cause I got it right here.
You picking on my friends? Get
ready to feel the thunder. I'm
comin' at him with the crazy feet.
Whatcha gonna do about my crazy
feet? I'm a blur. I'm a blur. You
never seen bear style, you only
seen praying Mantis! OR... I could
come at you Monkey style. OR... I'm
comin' at ya snikity-snake.

NAME: Person_2
Would you hit it!

NAME: Person_1
Alright...alright.

NAME: Person_2
Why don't you try again?   A little
harder...

NAME: Person_1
How's tha--

NAME: Person_1
Ow, that hurts.

NAME: Person_2
This'll be easier than I thought.

NAME: Person_1
Feeling a little nauseous.

NAME: Person_1
Ow, those are hard! Ooh! I think

NAME: Person_1
Oooohoohoo...my tenders.

NAME: Person_1
How did I do?

NAME: Person_2
There is now a level zero.

NAME: Side_1
There's no words.

NAME: Person_9
No denying that.

NAME: Side_2
I don't understand what Master
Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
just gonna get himself killed.

NAME: Person_9
He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
fell out of the sky on a ball of
fire.

NAME: Side_1
When he walks, the very ground
shakes!

NAME: Person_5
One would think that Master Oogway
would choose someone who actually
knew Kung Fu.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, or could at least touch his
toes.

NAME: Side_3
Or even see his toes.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Great.

NAME: Person_1
Oh hey...hi. You're up.

NAME: Person_9
Am now.

NAME: Person_1
I was just uh... Some day huh?
That kung fu stuff is hard work,
right? Your biceps sore?

NAME: Person_9
Um...I've had a long and rather
disappointing day, so uh...yeah, I
should probably get to sleep now.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah yeah yeah, of course.

NAME: Person_9
Okay, thanks.

NAME: Person_1
It's just...I'm such a big fan.

NAME: Person_9
Oop.

NAME: Person_1
You guys were totally amazing at
the Battle of Weeping River.
Outnumbered a thousand to one, but
you didn't stop, and then you
just... HI-YAH!

NAME: Person_1
Ooo, sorry about that.

NAME: Person_9
Look, you don't belong here.

NAME: Person_1
I know. I know. You're right. I
just - my whole life I've dreamed
of-

NAME: Person_9
No no no... I meant you don't
belong here. I mean, in this room.
This is my room. Property of Crane.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, okay. Right right. Yeah, you
want to get to sleep.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
I'm keepin' you up. We got big
things tomorrow. Alright. You're
awesome. Last thing I'm gonna say.
Okay. Bye bye.

NAME: Person_1
What was that?

NAME: Person_9
I didn't say anything.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Alright. Goodnight. Sleep
well.

NAME: Person_1
Seemed a little bit awkward.

NAME: Person_1
Master Tigress! Didn't mean to wake
you. Just uh...

NAME: Person_5
You don't belong here.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, yeah, yeah. Of course. This is
your room.

NAME: Person_5
I mean...you don't belong in the
Jade Palace. You're a disgrace to
Kung Fu, and if you have any
respect for who we are and what we
do, you will be gone by morning.

NAME: Person_1
Big fan...

NAME: Person_4
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

NAME: Person_1
Is that what this is? I am so
sorry. I thought it was just a
regular peach tree.

NAME: Person_4
I understand. You eat when you are
upset.

NAME: Person_1
Upset? I'm not upset. What makes
you think I'm upset?

NAME: Person_4
So why are you upset?

NAME: Person_1
I probably sucked more today than
anyone in the history of kung fu,
in the history of China, in the
history of sucking.

NAME: Person_4
Probably.

NAME: Person_1
And the Five... man, you should
have seen them, they totally hate
me.

NAME: Person_4
Totally.

NAME: Person_1
How's Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior? I mean,
I'm not like The Five. I've got no
claws, no wings, no venom. Even
Mantis has those...
(he imitates a mantis'
front legs)
...thingies. Maybe I should just
quit and go back to making noodles.

NAME: Person_4
Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't
noodles.

NAME: Person_4
You are too concerned with what was
and what will be. There is a
saying: Yesterday is history,
tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
a gift. That is why it is called
the present.

NAME: Person_7
What's happening?!

NAME: Person_8
Fire Crossbows!

NAME: Person_7
Tai Lung is free! I must warn
Shifu!

NAME: Person_8
You're not going anywhere. And
neither is he.

NAME: Person_7
Let go of me!

NAME: Person_8
Bring it up!

NAME: Person_7
He's coming this way!

NAME: Person_8
He won't get far.
Archers!

NAME: Person_7
We're dead. So very, very dead.

NAME: Person_8
Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!

NAME: Person_7
Can we run now?

NAME: Person_8
Yes.

NAME: Person_7
Nuuu... Urggg...

NAME: Person_6
I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
beginning to think I had been
forgotten.

NAME: Person_6
Fly back there and tell them...the
real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

NAME: Side_5
Good morning master!

NAME: Person_2
Panda! Panda, wake up!

NAME: Person_2
Hmm. He's quit.

NAME: Side_2
What do we do now, Master? With the
panda gone, who will be the Dragon
Warrior?

NAME: Person_2
All we can do is resume our
training and trust that in time,
the true Dragon Warrior will be
revealed.

NAME: Person_2
What are you doing here?!

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Huh... Good morning, Master! I
thought I'd warm up a little.

NAME: Person_2
You're stuck.

NAME: Person_1
Stuck?! Whaa? Pfft... stuck...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

NAME: Person_2
Help him.

NAME: Person_9
Oh dear.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe on three. One. Two-

NAME: Person_1
Threeeee. Thank you.

NAME: Person_9
Don't mention it.

NAME: Person_1
No really, I appreci--

NAME: Person_2
You actually thought you could
learn to do a full split in one
night? It takes years to develop
one's flexibility and years longer
to apply it in combat.

NAME: Person_2
Put that down! The only souvenirs
we collect here are bloody knuckles
and broken bones.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, excellent!

NAME: Person_2
Let's get started.

NAME: Side_2
Are you ready?

NAME: Person_1
I was born ready--

NAME: Person_1
Eaghhh...

NAME: Side_2
I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
said you were ready!

NAME: Person_1
That was awesome! Let's go again.

NAME: Person_2
I've been taking it easy on you,
panda, but no more! Your next
opponent... will be me.

NAME: Person_1
Alright! Let's go!

NAME: Person_2
Step forth.

NAME: Person_2
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness and make
him suffer for it.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, yeah!

NAME: Person_2
To take his strength and use it
against him.

NAME: Person_2
--until he finally falls, or quits.

NAME: Person_1
But a real warrior never quits.
Don't worry, Master, I will never
quit!

NAME: Person_5
If he's smart, he won't come back
up those steps.

NAME: Side_3
But he will.

NAME: Side_2
He's not gonna quit, is he?

NAME: Side_1
He's not gonna quit bouncin', I'll
tell ya that.

NAME: Side_1
Trust me, it will. It's just not
easy finding the right nerve points
under all this--

NAME: Person_1
Fat?

NAME: Side_1
Fur, I was gonna say fur.

NAME: Person_1
Sure you were.

NAME: Side_1
Who am I to judge a warrior based
on his size? I mean -- look at me.

NAME: Side_1 (O.C.)
I'm over here.

NAME: Person_1
Ow!

NAME: Side_2
Maybe you should take a look at
this again.

NAME: Side_1
Oh! Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Ow! Don't...
Stop it, stop-- Yow! I know Master
Shifu's trying to inspire me and
all, but if I didn't know any
better, I'd say he was trying to
get rid of me.

NAME: Side_1
I know he can seem kind of
heartless--

NAME: Side_1
But, ya know, he wasn't always like
that.

NAME: Side_2
According to legend, there was once
a time when Master Shifu actually
used to smile.

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Side_1
Yes.

NAME: Side_2
But that was before...

NAME: Person_1
Before what?

NAME: Person_5
Before Tai Lung.

NAME: Person_9
Uh yeah, we're not really supposed
to talk about him.

NAME: Person_5
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

NAME: Person_1
(trying to ease the
tension)
Guys, guys. I know about Tai Lung.

NAME: Person_1
He was a student, the first ever to
master the thousand...

NAME: Person_1
...scrolls of... kung fu... and...
then he turned bad... and now he's
in jail.

NAME: Person_5
He wasn't just a student.

NAME: Person_5
And now he has a chance to make
things right, to train the true
Dragon Warrior. And he's stuck with
you: a big, fat panda who treats it
like a joke.

NAME: Person_1
Doieeeee...

NAME: Person_5
Oh! That is it!

NAME: Side_1
Wait! My fault! I accidentally
tweaked his facial nerve.

NAME: Side_1
And may have also stopped his
heart.

NAME: Person_2
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
peace.

NAME: Person_2
Would whoever is making that
flapping sound, quiet down!

NAME: Person_2
Inner...

NAME: Person_2
Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
some good news right now.

NAME: Person_7
Uh...

NAME: Person_2
Master! Master!

NAME: Person_4
Hmmm?

NAME: Person_2
I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.

NAME: Person_4
Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

NAME: Person_2
Master, your vision...your vision
was right. Tai Lung has broken out
of prison. He's on his way!

NAME: Person_4
That is bad news...

NAME: Person_4
...If you do not believe that the
Dragon Warrior can stop him.

NAME: Person_2
The panda? Master, that panda is
not the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: Person_2
He wasn't even meant to be here --
it was an accident!

NAME: Person_4
There are no accidents.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I know. You've said that
already. Twice.

NAME: Person_4
Well, that was no accident either.

NAME: Person_2
Thrice.

NAME: Person_4
My old friend, the panda will never
fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
until you let go of the illusion of
control.

NAME: Person_2
Illusion?

NAME: Person_4
Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
cannot make it blossom when it
suits me, nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

NAME: Person_2
But there are things we can
control.

NAME: Person_2
I can control when the fruit will
fall.

NAME: Person_2
And I can control--

NAME: Person_2
--where to plant the seed. That is
no illusion, Master.

NAME: Person_4
Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
that seed will grow to be a peach
tree. You may wish for an apple, or
an orange... but you will get a
peach.

NAME: Person_2
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

NAME: Person_4
Maybe it can. If you are willing to
guide it, to nurture it. To believe
in it.

NAME: Person_2
But how? How? I need your help,
Master.

NAME: Person_4
No, you just need to believe.
Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
will believe.

NAME: Person_2
I... I will try.

NAME: Person_4
Good. My time has come. You must
continue your journey without me.

NAME: Person_2
What... what are you..?

NAME: Person_2
Master, you can't leave me!

NAME: Person_4
You must believe.

NAME: Person_2
Master!

NAME: Person_1
...but you're a lousy tipper.

NAME: Person_9
Really? So... how'd you get out of
there alive?

NAME: Person_1
I mean, I didn't actually say that,
but I thought it... in my mind.

NAME: Person_1
If he... could read my mind, he'd
have been like, "What?"
Order up!

NAME: Person_1
Hope you like it.

NAME: Side_1
This is really good.

NAME: Person_1
No, c'mon.

NAME: Person_1
You should try my dad's secret
ingredient soup. He actually knows
the secret ingredient.

NAME: Side_2
What are you talking about? This is
amazing.

NAME: Person_9
Wow, you're a really good cook.

NAME: Side_1
I wish my mouth was bigger.

NAME: Side_3
Tigress, you gotta try this.

NAME: Person_5
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months at a time on
nothing but the dew of a single
gingko leaf and the energy of the
universe.

NAME: Person_1
I guess my body doesn't know it's
the Dragon Warrior yet. I'm gonna
need a lot more than dew. And, uh,
universe juice.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Side_1
Oh, nothing... Master Shifu!

NAME: Person_1
You will never be the Dragon
Warrior, unless you lose five
hundred pounds and brush your
teeth!

NAME: Person_1
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

NAME: Person_1
Work hard, Panda. And maybe,
someday... you will have ears like
mine.

NAME: Person_1
Ears. It's not working for you? I
thought they were pretty good.

NAME: Side_3
It's Shifu.

NAME: Person_1
Of course it's Shifu. What do you
think I'm doing?

NAME: Person_1
Ooh! Master Shifu!

NAME: Person_2
You think this is funny? Tai Lung
has escaped from prison and you're
acting like children!

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,
and you are the only one who can
stop him.

NAME: Person_1
And here I am saying you got no
sense of humor. I'm gonna stop
Tai...

NAME: Person_1
What? You're serious? And I have to--
uh, Master Oogway will stop him! He
did it before, he'll do it again.

NAME: Person_2
Oogway cannot, not anymore.

NAME: Person_2
Our only hope is the Dragon
Warrior.

NAME: Person_5
The panda?

NAME: Person_2
Yes, the panda!

NAME: Person_5
Master, please. Let us stop Tai
Lung. This is what you've trained
us for.

NAME: Person_2
No! It is not your destiny to
defeat Tai Lung. It is his.

NAME: Person_2
Where'd he go?

NAME: Person_2
You cannot leave! A real warrior
never quits!

NAME: Person_1
Watch me!

NAME: Person_1
Come on! How am I supposed to beat
Tai Lung? I can't even beat you to
the stairs.

NAME: Person_2
You will beat him because you are
the Dragon Warrior!

NAME: Person_1
Ow! You don't believe that! You
never believed that! From the first
moment I got here, you've been
trying to get rid of me.

NAME: Person_2
Yes. I was. But now I ask you to
trust in your master as I have come
to trust in mine.

NAME: Person_1
You're not my master. And I'm not
the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: Person_2
Then why didn't you quit? You knew
I was trying to get rid of you, and
yet you stayed.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I stayed. I stayed because
every time you threw a brick at my
head or said I smelled, it hurt.
But it could never hurt more than
it did every day of my life just
being me.

NAME: Person_1
I stayed because I thought if
anyone could change me, could make
me... not me, it was you. The
greatest kung fu teacher in all of
China.

NAME: Person_2
But I can change you! I can turn
you into the Dragon Warrior! And I
will!

NAME: Person_1
C'mon, Tai Lung is on his way here
right now. And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here, how
are you gonna change this...
...into the Dragon Warrior? How?
How? How?!

NAME: Person_2
I don't know!!!
I don't know.

NAME: Person_1
That's what I thought.

NAME: Person_5
This is what you trained me for.

NAME: Side_2
Tigress!

NAME: Person_5
Don't try and stop me!

NAME: Side_2
We're not trying to stop you!

NAME: Person_5
What?

NAME: Side_2
We're coming with you!

NAME: Person_1
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, no need to explain. I just
thought you might be Monkey -- he
hides his almond cookies on the top
shelf.

NAME: Person_1
Don't tell Monkey.

NAME: Person_2
Look at you.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I know. I disgust you.

NAME: Person_2
No no, I mean... how did you get up
there?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know. I guess I-- I don't
know. I was getting a cookie...

NAME: Person_2
And yet you are ten feet off the
ground and have done a perfect
split.

NAME: Person_1
No, this... this is just an
accident.

NAME: Person_2
There are no accidents. Come with
me.

NAME: Person_1
I know you're trying to be all
mystical and kung fu-y, but could
you at least tell me where we're
going?

NAME: Person_1
You dragged me all the way out here
for a bath?!

NAME: Person_2
Panda, we do not wash our pits in
The Pool of Sacred Tears.

NAME: Person_1
The pool of...

NAME: Person_2
This is where Oogway unravelled the
mysteries of harmony and focus.
This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.

NAME: Person_2
Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah...

NAME: Person_2
Then I am your master!

NAME: Person_1
Okay!

NAME: Person_2
Don't cry.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_2
When you focus on Kung Fu, when you
concentrate...you stink.

NAME: Person_2
But perhaps that is my fault. I
cannot train you the way I have
trained the Five. I now see that
the way to get through to you is
with this!

NAME: Person_1
Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.

NAME: Person_2
Good. When you have been trained,
you may eat. Let us begin.

NAME: Person_2
After you, panda.

NAME: Person_1
Just like that? No situps? No ten
mile hike?

NAME: Person_2
I vowed to train you... and you
have been trained. You are free to
eat.

NAME: Person_2
Enjoy.

NAME: Person_1
Hey!

NAME: Person_2
I said you are free to eat. Have a
dumpling.

NAME: Person_1
Hey!

NAME: Person_2
You are free to eat!

NAME: Person_1
Am I?

NAME: Person_2
Are you?!

NAME: Person_1
I'm not hungry... master.

NAME: Person_5
Cut it!

NAME: Person_6
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

NAME: Person_5
How do you know you're not looking
at her?

NAME: Person_6
You think I'm a fool? I know you're
not the Dragon Warrior. None of
you!

NAME: Person_6
I heard how he fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire, that he's a
warrior unlike anything the world
has ever seen.

NAME: Side_3
Po?

NAME: Person_6
So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
a worthy opponent. Our battle will
be legendary!

NAME: Side_3
We've got this. Help her!

NAME: Side_2
Monkey!

NAME: Side_1
Go!
Ack! What was I thinking?!

NAME: Person_5
Mantis!

NAME: Person_5
Now!

NAME: Person_6
Shifu taught you well...

NAME: Person_6
But he didn't teach you everything.

NAME: Person_2
You have done well, Panda.

NAME: Person_1
Done well? Done well?! I've done
awesome!

NAME: Person_2
The mark of a true hero is
humility!

NAME: Person_2
But yes...you have done awesome.

NAME: Person_1
Huh? Guys? Guys!

NAME: Person_1
They're dead? No, they're
breathing! They're asleep?! No,
their eyes are open.

NAME: Person_9
We were no match for his nerve
attack.

NAME: Person_2
He has gotten stronger.

NAME: Person_1
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

NAME: Side_3
He's too fast!

NAME: Side_3
Sorry, Po.

NAME: Person_5
I thought we could stop him.

NAME: Person_2
He could have killed you.

NAME: Side_1
Why didn't he?

NAME: Person_2
So you could come back here and
strike fear into our hearts. But it
won't work!

NAME: Person_1
Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
pretty scared.

NAME: Person_2
You can defeat him, panda.

NAME: Person_1
Are you kidding? If they can't--
They're five masters. I'm just one
me.

NAME: Person_2
But you will have the one thing
that no one else does.

NAME: Person_1
You really believe I'm ready?

NAME: Person_2
You are, Po.

NAME: Person_2
Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
yours.

NAME: Person_1
Wait, what happens when I read it?

NAME: Person_2
No one knows, but legend says you
will be able to hear a butterfly's
wing-beat.

NAME: Person_1
Whoa! Really? That's cool.

NAME: Person_2
Yes. And see light in the deepest
cave. You will feel the universe in
motion around you.

NAME: Person_1
Wow! Can I punch through walls?
Can I do a quadruple back flip?
Will I have invisibility--

NAME: Person_2
Focus. Focus.

NAME: Person_1
Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.

NAME: Person_2
Read it, Po, and fulfill your
destiny. Read it and become... the
Dragon Warrior!

NAME: Person_1
Whooaa!!!

NAME: Person_1
It's impossible to open.

NAME: Person_1
Come on baby. Come on now...

NAME: Person_1
Thank you. I probably loosened it
up for you though... Okay, here
goes.

NAME: Person_1
It's blank!

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
Here! Look!

NAME: Person_2
No! I am forbidden to look upon--

NAME: Person_2
Blank? I don't...I don't
understand.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
crazy old turtle after all?

NAME: Person_2
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
by accident. Of course I'm not the
Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?

NAME: Person_5
But who will stop Tai Lung?

NAME: Person_9
He'll destroy everything...and
everyone.

NAME: Person_2
No, evacuate the Valley. You must
protect the villagers from Tai
Lung's rage.

NAME: Person_5
What about you master?

NAME: Person_2
I will fight him.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
I can hold him off long enough for
everyone to escape.

NAME: Person_1
But Shifu, he'll kill you.

NAME: Person_2
Then I will finally have paid for
my mistake.

NAME: Person_2
Listen to me, all of you. It is
time for you to continue your
journey without me. I am very proud
to have been your master.

NAME: Person_5
We've got to get them out safely.

NAME: Side_3
Come, little one. Let's find your
mama.

NAME: Person_5
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the
way.

NAME: Side_7
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Dad.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Po!

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Good to have you back, son!

NAME: Person_1
Good to be back.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
it's time to face it -- the future
of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
no longer slices.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Also, I was thinking, maybe this
time we'll have a kitchen you can
actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
that?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
out. It just... wasn't meant to be.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Po, forget everything else. Your
destiny still awaits. We are noodle
folk -- broth runs deep through our
veins.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know, Dad. Honestly,
sometimes I can't believe I'm
actually your son.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Po, I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you a
long time ago...

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
The secret ingredient of my secret
ingredient soup!

NAME: Person_1
Oh.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
C'mere! The secret ingredient is...
nothing!

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
You heard me. Nothing. There is no
secret ingredient!

NAME: Person_1
Wait wait...it's just plain old
noodle soup? You don't add some
kind of special sauce or something?

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just have to believe
it's special.

NAME: Person_1
There is no secret ingredient...

NAME: Person_6
I have come home, Master.

NAME: Person_2
This is no longer your home. And I
am no longer your master.

NAME: Person_6
Yes. You have a new favorite. So
where is this...Po? Did I scare him
off?

NAME: Person_2
This battle is between you and me.

NAME: Person_6
So. That is how it's going to be?

NAME: Person_2
That is how it must be.

NAME: Person_6
I rotted in jail for twenty years
because of your weakness!

NAME: Person_2
Obeying your master is not
weakness!

NAME: Person_6
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
You always knew...

NAME: Person_2
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

NAME: Person_2
It was never my decision to make!

NAME: Person_6
It is now.

NAME: Person_6
Give me the scroll!

NAME: Person_2
I would rather die.

NAME: Person_6
All I ever did, I did to make you
proud! Tell me how proud you are,
Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!

NAME: Person_2
I have always been proud of you.
From the first moment, I've been
proud of you. And it was my pride
that blinded me. I loved you too
much to see what you were becoming.
What I was turning you into. I'm...
sorry.

NAME: Person_6
I don't want your apology. I want
my scroll!

NAME: Person_2
Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
halfway across China by now. You
will never see that scroll, Tai
Lung. Never. Never...

NAME: Person_1
Stairs...

NAME: Person_6
Who are you?

NAME: Person_1
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
Huhhh...

NAME: Person_6
You?! Him?!
He's a panda.
You're a panda. What are you gonna
do, big guy? Sit on me?

NAME: Person_1
Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
use this. You want it? Come and get
it.

NAME: Person_6
Finally!

NAME: Person_6
That scroll is mine!

NAME: Person_1
Lightning!

NAME: Person_6
The scroll has given him power.

NAME: Person_6
Finally... oh yes... the power of
the Dragon Scroll... is mine!

NAME: Person_6
It's NOTHING!!

NAME: Person_1
It's okay. I didn't get it the
first time either.

NAME: Person_6
What?

NAME: Person_1
There is no secret ingredient. It's
just you.

NAME: Person_1
Stop! Stop it! I'm gonna pee!
Don't! Don't!

NAME: Person_6
You... can't defeat me. You're just
a big, fat panda!

NAME: Person_1
I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
big, fat panda.

NAME: Person_6
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, you know this hold?

NAME: Person_6
You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
Shifu didn't teach you that.

NAME: Person_1
Nope. I figured it out.

NAME: Person_1
Skadoosh!

NAME: Side_6
Look! The Dragon Warrior.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
That's my boy. That big, lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

NAME: Person_1
Thanks, Dad.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, guys.

NAME: Person_5
Master.

NAME: Side_5
Master.

NAME: Person_1
Master?
Master Shifu!

NAME: Person_1
Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?

NAME: Person_2
Po! You're alive!
Or we're both dead.

NAME: Person_1
No, Master, I didn't die. I
defeated Tai Lung!

NAME: Person_2
You did?!

NAME: Person_2
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
You are the Dragon Warrior. You
have brought peace to this Valley.
And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
Po. Thank you...

NAME: Person_1
No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
Shifu. Please...

NAME: Person_2
I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
peace. Finally.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. So, um, I should...stop
talking?

NAME: Person_2
If you can.

NAME: Person_1
Want to get something to eat?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Side_19
No one knows where it came from.
There had been others. Mysterious
relics of another world. But only
one with the power to stop the
world.

NAME: Side_19
Many vied for its dark magic. A
few brave souls endeavoured to
hide it from those who would use
it for ill. Until finally,
thankfully it was lost to history.

NAME: Side_19
Ours is a story of a world that
knows not where it comes from.
That cannot imagine what it is
capable of. Perhaps you can
relate. I know I can.

NAME: Side_10
The Black Falcon. I should've
known.

NAME: Person_5
Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this
place? Must have been a bunch of
lazy hippies, sitting around a
table agreeing with each other.

NAME: Side_10
It was built by the ancients.
With more wisdom and artistry than
you can ever know.

NAME: Person_5
The Kragle...

NAME: Side_10
That belongs to the Maker. It
must be protected!

NAME: Person_5
What a lame boyscout thing to say!
You're standing before the most
powerful object in the world and
you don't want to use it? You're a
real nerd, Indiana Jones.

NAME: Side_10
The MasterBuilders will learn of
this.

NAME: Person_5
And what do you know of them?

NAME: Side_10
Only that they will be your
undoing.

NAME: Person_5
Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French
for ciao.

NAME: Side_10
The Black Falcon has the Kragle.

NAME: Side_27
Gemini. Find the Chosen One.

NAME: Side_16
Okay.

NAME: Side_10
They followed me...

NAME: Person_3
Emmet!

NAME: Person_3
Did you clean your room?! The
cleaning woman is coming today!

NAME: Person_3
Because I want her to know what a
nice rule-following son I have!

NAME: Person_1
Mom!

NAME: Person_3
Aw, it is clean.

NAME: Person_1
It's always clean!

NAME: Person_1
What's the point of having my own
apartment across the hall from
your apartment if you're going to
check up on me like I still live
at home?

NAME: Person_3
I just love you and want my son to
be safe and happy. Can't you work
from home? Like a sociopath or
children's book author?

NAME: Person_1
Mom. I've spent my whole life
here. I need to go out there and
follow my dream of fitting in and
being like everybody else.

NAME: Person_3
My boy. All grown up. Maybe soon
you'll meet a girl and be married!

NAME: Person_1
Mom, please!

NAME: Person_3
I'm just saying, it's been how
many years since Lucy?

NAME: Person_1
Mom... I had the dream again.

NAME: Side_21
Emmet. This wasn't the assignment.
You've got to learn to follow the
rules.

NAME: Side_21
Everyone, the assignment is to
draw your hand, not a silly face.

NAME: Side_14S
That's the guys who drew a face. /
What a weirdo. / He doesn't know
how to follow instructions. / He's
not invited to my birthday.

NAME: Person_3
I hated that day. The kids were so
mean, the school tried to expel
you... I promised myself I'd never
let anything like that happen to
you again. And it hasn't. So you
need to let your memory of that
day go. It never happened.

NAME: Person_1
I just want to be normal, Mom.

NAME: Person_3
Listen. You're my son. And you're
the most normal, regular, average
person I know.

NAME: Person_1
You mean it?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Are you crying?

NAME: Person_3
No. Yes. Emmet...

NAME: Person_3
Don't forget dinner.

NAME: Person_1
Promise.

NAME: Person_3
Be safe.

NAME: Person_1
Of course.

NAME: Person_3
Don't make waves.

NAME: Person_1
I never do.

NAME: Person_3
And follow the instructions.

NAME: Person_1
Always.

NAME: Person_3
If they weren't so firm and flush
with your head, I would pinch your
cheeks right now.

NAME: Person_1
Love you, Mom.

NAME: Person_3
Love you.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I love this song! And so
does everyone else!

NAME: Person_1
Hello.

NAME: Side_3
What'll it be?

NAME: Person_1
I'm Emmet.

NAME: Side_3
Larry?

NAME: Person_1
Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee
please.

NAME: Side_3
Cappuccino, macchiato, espresso,
americano.

NAME: Person_1
What are those? Sounds a little
foofy.

NAME: Side_3
They're all coffee.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild.
I don't know, what do you think?

NAME: Side_3
A decaf.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, yeah. Cool.

NAME: Side_3
Venti, Grande, or Super Grande?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, goodness. So much selection.
So hard to decide! You pick.

NAME: Side_3
That's a personal decision that
only you can make.

NAME: Person_1
Uh. Gosh, which is the most
popular?

NAME: Side_3
Super Grande. It's Italian for
medium.

NAME: Person_1
Medium. That's what I'm havin'!
That is my style.

NAME: Side_3
Fantastic.

NAME: Person_1
You creative types! So
delightfully sardonic!

NAME: Side_3
I push one of two buttons on a
machine. I would hardly call that
creative. I would call that
following instructions.

NAME: Person_1
But it says Kreative right on your
shirt! With an extra "kreative"
spelling aberration! I totally
don't get it!

NAME: Side_4
Alright, kid. Here's the rules.

NAME: Person_1
Ooh, great.

NAME: Side_4
Stay on your feet--

NAME: Person_1
Mmm hmm.

NAME: Side_4
Stick to the instructions--

NAME: Person_1
Uh huh.

NAME: Side_4
And don't get creative!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not
some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!

NAME: Side_4
It's Sean.

NAME: Side_4
The pieces get sent down from
corporate bundled together with
the instructions. Take the one
with your section on it and follow
it to the letter. Keep track of
all the pieces. If you lose one of
the special ones it'll seriously
drive you crazy.

NAME: Side_4
Today you'll be putting together
an artists' loft.

NAME: Person_1
Is it for an artist?

NAME: Side_4
Oh, no. It's for an accountant.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, great.

NAME: Side_4
Pretty soon, the whole city will
look like this. All part of some
big master plan from Central.

NAME: Person_1
Wow...

NAME: Person_1
What if I mess up or lose my place
or something?

NAME: Side_4
Just do what everyone else does.
Keep your head down, follow
instructions, and you could get
promoted. Central's got some big
project coming up overseas.

NAME: Person_1
Overseas? I don't know. I'm not
big on travel.

NAME: Side_4
Whatever, kid.

NAME: Person_1
One more question.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you. For making my dreams
come true.

NAME: Side_4
Is that a question?

NAME: Person_1
So.

NAME: Person_1
How about that local sports team?
What do you think of how they
played the other day?

NAME: Side_12
Ugh, they were awful.

NAME: Person_1
Right? They should make a
personnel change of some kind.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, the coach!

NAME: Side_12
He's the only good thing about
that team.

NAME: Person_1
They should so keep him!

NAME: Side_12
We're all going to watch the game
after work. Eat a little grub.
Want to join?

NAME: Person_1
Really?!
Actually, I'm supposed to have
dinner with my-- What the heck?
I'm in.

NAME: Side_12
Alright then.

NAME: Person_1
Cool. Definitely cool.
Hey did you hear that song on the
way in to work this morning?

NAME: Side_12
Everything is Awesome? I love
that song.

NAME: Side_30
Me too!

NAME: Person_1
I think I know why I like that
song so much.

NAME: Side_12
Why's that?

NAME: Person_1
Because everything is awesome.

NAME: Side_12S
Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never
thought of it like that.

NAME: Side_4
Kid! What the heck is that?!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, uh. I don't know. What?

NAME: Side_4
That's not the instructions.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know what happened. I was
just looking out at the clouds,
and-- It was an accident.

NAME: Person_1
Code Danger? What's so dangerous?

NAME: Person_1
Oh.

NAME: Side_32
Loose brick!

NAME: Side_32'S PARTNER
Loose brick!

NAME: Side_34
Stop that building!

NAME: Person_1
--unbelievably sorry. I am
honestly the last person who would
do something like thi--

NAME: Person_1
--eriously, a model citizen. I
got straight As. I vote! Even in
the off-year elections, for school
board and stuff--

NAME: Person_1
--swear, I'm not special at all.
Just ask my mom! I'm a totally
average normal person!

NAME: Side_2
Oh yeah? What size coffee do you
drink?

NAME: Person_1
Super grande.

NAME: Side_2
Dammit! I can't break him.

NAME: Person_1
You don't need to break me! I'm
just a regular old totally

NAME: Person_1
I'm Emmet. What's your name?

NAME: Side_35
...we're still following the story
of the construction worker who got
a little creative on his first day
on the job. The subject was
described as looking and acting
exactly like everybody else...
Police have taken the nondescript
suspect into custody, and he is
being held in the city jail.

NAME: Person_1
Mom? What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_3
I'm breaking you out.

NAME: Person_1
But, that's breaking the rules.
You told me never to do that.

NAME: Person_3
Well I'm temporarily reversing my
position for reasons of
convenience.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_3
The rules are different now.

NAME: Person_1
But I did something really bad.

NAME: Person_3
No you didn't.

NAME: Person_1
Mom. You taught me to be a person
of principle, and I stand by my
principles of doing whatever
authority tells me to.

NAME: Person_3
Great. Fine. Would you mind
holding my purse?

NAME: Person_1
Sure.

NAME: Person_1
Wh-- what are you doing?

NAME: Person_3
Saving your life.

NAME: Person_1
Where did you get a blowdart?

NAME: Person_3
That's not important.

NAME: Person_1
Half my body is numb! My hand is
stuck shut! That seems important!

NAME: Person_3
I just broke you out of prison!

NAME: Person_1
For a misdemeanor! They didn't
even decide how long I'd be in
there for yet.

NAME: Person_3
They won't ever decide. You don't

NAME: Person_1
You don't understand! I was
having the best day of my life
today. I was one of the guys. We
were going to go to a dinner and
talk about life and stuff--

NAME: Person_3
You were supposed to have dinner
with me.

NAME: Person_1
I was going to call.

NAME: Person_3
Well it feels amazing to spend
twenty years loving and protecting
someone and the first day out of
the nest they wind up on the news.

NAME: Person_1
I made a mistake. I'll explain it
to the judge tomorrow and
everything will be fine. Only it
won't because I can't because
suddenly I am an ESCAPED FUGITIVE!

NAME: Person_3
It's for your own good.

NAME: Person_1
You can't protect me my whole
life.

NAME: Person_3
You wanna bet? Come on.

NAME: Person_1
Mom, I'm going back to jail to
repay my debt to society. A
society that I would like to be a
part of.

NAME: Person_3
You have to trust me--

NAME: Person_1
You have to trust me! I'm my own
person. You have to let me grow
up and make my own choices--

NAME: Person_3
I tried, and look what happened!

NAME: Person_1
Maybe if you didn't mother me so
much I'd have been a little better
equipped. Ever think of that?

NAME: Person_3
As a matter of fact I did. All
the time.

NAME: Person_1
Ugh. You know what you are, Mom?
You want to really know? A real
pain in the elbow!

NAME: Person_3
Emmet!

NAME: Person_1
Mom? Mom!!!!

NAME: Side_16
Where did she go?!

NAME: Person_1
What's happening?!

NAME: Person_1
How did you--

NAME: Person_1
My mom got kidnapped by ninjas
then a lady turned a mailbox into
a motorcycle and now we have to
catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.

NAME: Side_3
Get in, I guess?

NAME: Side_3
What's with the purse?

NAME: Person_3
What do you want with me?!

NAME: Person_3
You have the wrong person!

NAME: Person_1
Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm
going to save you!

NAME: Side_16
Stop, Emmet! You're going to
screw everything up!

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm not! How do you know my
name?

NAME: Side_6
What the FLIPPING FLIP IS

NAME: Person_1
You're breaking the speed limit,
you know. Not to mention several
other laws, as a well as a few
other things that are not written
into law per se, but are accepted
social practices.

NAME: Side_16
Emmet.

NAME: Person_1
Lucy?

NAME: Person_2
It's Gemini now.

NAME: Person_1
Are you a DJ?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_1
So, uh, how have the last seven
years been?

NAME: Person_2
Okay.

NAME: Person_3
Emmet?!
Don't you dare hurt him.

NAME: Person_1
So. I have a lot of questions.

NAME: Person_2
Is this really the best time to
talk?

NAME: Person_1
Well, so far...

NAME: Person_2
Fine. Shoot.

NAME: Person_1
Why did those ninjas take my mom?
Why are there ninjas? Are they
robotic ninjas? Where have you
been the last seven years? When
did you gain magical superpowers?
Why did you change your name to
Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you
ask me. Also, have you been
following me around this whole
time? Because that's pretty weird
considering last time I saw you
was when you dumped me for
absolutely no reason.

NAME: Side_3
You guys used to date? Nice.

NAME: Person_2
Hardly.

NAME: Person_1
Oh try all of 8th grade!

NAME: Side_3
Burn.

NAME: Person_2
By the way, I'm seeing someone
now, so don't get any ideas.

NAME: Person_1
I never have any ideas.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, thank goodness, the police are
here.

NAME: Person_1
Never mind.

NAME: Person_2
You don't get it, do you?

NAME: Person_1
Get what?

NAME: Person_2
They're here for the Chosen One.

NAME: Person_1
The Chosen One? What the heck is
that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep
telling everyone- I'm just a
regular guy!

NAME: Person_2
Not you. Your mom.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. Really?

NAME: Person_2
I was sent to get her, but they
got to her first.

NAME: Person_1
You're sure I'm not the Chosen
One?

NAME: Person_2
Emmet, your mother is the most
powerful being in the universe.

NAME: Person_1
But-- how-- she has cankles!

NAME: Person_2
Don't we all.

NAME: Person_2
She and I belong to an ancient
brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who
create from our imaginations, not
instructions, forced underground
by evil forces. She has long been
in hiding to protect you from
those forces. I was sent to summon
her, but when I showed up she was
too busy breaking you out of
prison.

NAME: Person_1
Okay I did not understand a lot of
that.

NAME: Person_2
Just hold the wheel.

NAME: Person_2
How... Emmet! Jump!

NAME: Person_1
Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

NAME: Person_2
It didn't break. How?

NAME: Person_1
She's gone. I can't believe she's
gone... because she tried to
protect me...?

NAME: Side_2
Send everyone you can out hunting
for that kid and whoever is trying
to help him. You hear me?!
He's wanted... broken or together.

NAME: Side_6
I need a coffee.

NAME: Person_1
Who exactly are these evil forces
my mom was trying to protect me
from? And why are the cops in
league with robot ninjas?

NAME: Person_2
You have a lot of questions.

NAME: Person_1
I'm just getting warmed up.

NAME: Person_2
They all work for the Black
Falcon.

NAME: Person_1
The Black Falcon?

NAME: Person_2
Otherwise known as Rodrigo
Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?

NAME: Person_1
Empura? I love their stuff.

NAME: Person_2
He is also the self-declared
Emperor of all known LEGO realms.
He kidnapped your mom because she
is the only one who can stop him
from destroying us all.

NAME: Person_1
My mom. My mom?

NAME: Person_2
Emmet, did your mom have a safe
deposit box, a safe, something
where she would have hidden
something very valuable?

NAME: Person_1
No. The only thing she had that
was worth anything was her purse.
She takes it with her everywhere.
Unfortunately it's now melted to
my arm. Ow!

NAME: Person_2
No...no...no...no...no...no...
No...no...no...no...no...no...

NAME: Person_1
Well, I guess it's not in there--

NAME: Person_2
No...no...no...no...no...no...

NAME: Person_2
It's not in there.

NAME: Person_2
What's her birthday?

NAME: Person_1
November twenty-second.

NAME: Person_2
Of course. Your birthday.
January six.

NAME: Person_2
Not by choice.

NAME: Person_2
The MasterPiece.

NAME: Person_1
What is this thing? It's...
beautiful.

NAME: Person_2
Some say it's the first piece
ever. No one knows exactly what it
does, but it is said the Chosen
One will use it to one day save
the world.

NAME: Person_1
And by that you mean my mom.

NAME: Person_2
There's an inscription.

NAME: Person_1
One will come from land afar,
With hand besmirched in shape of star.
One to confront a great forsaker,
And build a bridge to meet the Maker.
This one will make the world right,
But first there'll be an awesome fight.

NAME: Person_2
The prophecy of the Chosen One...

NAME: Person_1
Who is my Mom.

NAME: Person_2
Yes. We have to get this to your
mom so she can fulfill her destiny
and stop the Black Falcon before
he destroys us all.

NAME: Person_1
And if it weren't for me, she'd be
here and everything would be okay.

NAME: Side_36
Finn? I thought I told you not to
touch anything...

NAME: Person_1
What was that?

NAME: Person_2
What was what?

NAME: Person_2
We have to go. NOW.

NAME: Person_1
Where are we going?!

NAME: Person_2
We're going to take the MasterPiece
to someone who can help.

NAME: Person_1
The MasterBuilders council?

NAME: Person_2
No. They're gone. All of them.

NAME: Person_1
Then who?

NAME: Person_2
Vitruvius. He was once a great
MasterBuilder, now he's...retired.
But he's our only hope.

NAME: Person_1
Can't you do it on your own? You
were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!

NAME: Person_2
I can't, I'm...still in training.
I'm not a full-fledged
MasterBuilder yet. Technically,
I'm an intern.

NAME: Person_1
Well well well--

NAME: Person_1
You're not going to cross the city
limits, are you?

NAME: Person_2
Don't be a putz, Emmet.

NAME: Person_1
Everyone knows you're not allowed
to go Out of Town. It's dangerous,
uncharted and no one should ever go
that's what everybody says. Can't
we just explain the situation to
President Iamnotarobot?

NAME: Person_2
Iamnotarobot is one of the Black
Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever
notice how metallic he looks?

NAME: Person_1
Come on. He's just very fair
skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot"
in his very name! Besides, he's
way better than Councilman
Strawman. That guy is the pits.

NAME: Person_2
Don't be nave.

NAME: Person_1
What's nave?

NAME: Person_2
That.

NAME: Person_2
Look, just give me the MasterPiece
and I'll take it from here.

NAME: Person_1
My mom gave it to me and I'm not
giving it to anyone unless their
name is My Mom.

NAME: Person_2
Well then I guess you're going to
have to cross that line.

NAME: Person_1
Well then I guess I am.

NAME: Person_2
Well then go ahead and do it.

NAME: Person_1
Well then go ahead and do it I
shall.

NAME: Person_2
Dude!

NAME: Person_1
Okay, okay.

NAME: Person_2
Not everything is what it seems...

NAME: Person_1
Who are those guys?

NAME: Person_2
Annoying short whiners. Plus they
reproduce like crazy. It's a real
problem.

NAME: Person_1
Where are we? Where are all the
buildings? And coffee shops?

NAME: Person_2
Legopolis is only one realm in the
Black Falcon's dominion. He built
walls around all of them so he can
keep them separate. If the walls
came down, he'd have a hard time
controlling the results. The
MasterBuilders built secret
passages through the walls so we
could travel between lands.

NAME: Person_1
Who are they?

NAME: Person_2
The Black Falcon's sentries.
They're looking for us.

NAME: Person_1
So he controls all these worlds?

NAME: Person_2
Shh!

NAME: Side_37
The Black Falcon will see you now.

NAME: Person_5
Doris! Did someone get you a
water?

NAME: Person_3
You'll never get away with this.

NAME: Person_5
"You'll never get away with this!"
What a clich! You don't even know
what it is I'm trying to get away
with. Maybe you should listen
more.

NAME: Person_3
I'm all ears.

NAME: Person_5
Truly? Because listening and
hearing are not the same thing.

NAME: Person_3
I'm listening.

NAME: Person_5
Excellent.
Behold, the Kragle!

NAME: Person_3
The car in the city. That's why
it didn't break...

NAME: Person_5
Very good. But there's a lot more
to my plan than that. Check it:

NAME: Person_5
Here is your typical family. You
there. Move your arm a little
higher. A little higher... NO NO
NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are
all PATHETIC LOSERS!

NAME: Person_5
Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an
inch. You see how hard it is for
me? I have to make all these plans
and rules and enforce them on
people. It's whack-a-mole. I get
one thing perfect, and then
another thing gets messed up. Ay
ay ay I get so tired!

NAME: Person_3
You never did understand the way
of the Maker.

NAME: Person_5
Sure I do. There's one right way
to do everything, and I know it,
and everyone else is wrong and is
trying to screw me up! Until now.

NAME: Person_5
You. Introduce yourselves to me.

NAME: Side_13
I'm sorry?

NAME: Person_5
Like, you say to me "Hello Black
Falcon, I'm Dale, and this is my
wife Mary and our children Mark
and Lisa."

NAME: Side_13
But you just said it.

NAME: Person_5
Well, just-- you say it now.

NAME: Side_13
Hello Black Falcon, I'm Dale, this

NAME: Person_5
My wife Mary.

NAME: Person_5
And our children...

NAME: Side_13
And our kids--

NAME: Person_5
Children.

NAME: Side_13
And our children Mark and Lisa.

NAME: Person_5
All together now.

NAME: Side_13
< SIGH > Hello Black Falcon I'm
Dale, this is my wife Mary and our
children Mark and Lisa.

NAME: Person_5
Well, hello, Dale, Mary, Mark and
Lisa. I'm Black Falcon, and I'm
very FREEZE TO MEET YOU!

NAME: Person_5
Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA!
And it's totally permanent!

NAME: Person_3
You want to do this to the whole
world?

NAME: Person_5
So the whole world will be exactly
how I want.

NAME: Person_3
But-- I'll never see my son again.
No mother will ever see her son.

NAME: Person_5
Unless they're frozen when they
happen to be looking at each
other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so
glad we could finally meet again,
after all these years.

NAME: Person_3
What do you want from me?

NAME: Person_5
Isn't it obvious? I want you to
make me a better Kragle-Thingy!

NAME: Person_3
That's really dumb.

NAME: Person_5
I mean this works okay, but it
doesn't have a wide enough spray.
I need to make like a big cloud of
sticky mist. And it's not scary
enough. And I hate the color.

NAME: Person_3
You'll never get aw-- You'll not
achieve that which you have just
described!

NAME: Person_5
What, do you think your pathetic
son is going to save you or
something? He can't even put two
bricks together.

NAME: Person_5
Did you? I think you protected
him. Because you were afraid to
have him live under the spectre of
being found out. Of being hunted.
You wanted him to fit in. To feel
normal, isn't that right?

NAME: Person_5
Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to
that call, he's going to get his
butt kicked. He'll fit in,
alright. Into a coffin!

NAME: Person_3
Leave him out of this!

NAME: Person_5
I would, but I'm pretty sure he
has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in
your apartment, and it's not on
you. But your son seems to have
interesting taste in handbags.

NAME: Person_5
So, just to tie up all the loose
ends, I'll have to kill him and
take the MasterPiece so the
prophecy will never come true.

NAME: Person_3
No! Don't, please! I'll do what
you want, please don't hurt him.

NAME: Person_5
Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do
what I want regardless. I'll
simply use my very special
electromagnetic machine to extract
your thoughts and steal your ideas
like I've done for all the other
imprisoned MasterBuilders.

NAME: Person_3
No!

NAME: Person_5
Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!

NAME: Person_1
Is it much farther?

NAME: Person_2
Do you ever say something that
isn't a stupid question?

NAME: Person_1
What's that supposed to mean?

NAME: Person_2
I guess not.

NAME: Person_2
That's Dragon.

NAME: Person_1
Who could live here?

NAME: Person_2
A blind man.

NAME: Person_4
Hello! What? Hi!

NAME: Person_1
I see.

NAME: Person_1
Lovely place.

NAME: Person_4
Thank you. I am deprived of my
sight, but my hearing is so acute
that I can still perceive the
physical world using echolocation.

NAME: Person_1
Like an old bat...

NAME: Person_4
Precisely. I see with my ears.
Now, how can I help you, extremely
tall and fat stranger?

NAME: Person_1
My mother has been kidnapped and
it's all my fault.

NAME: Person_4
Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.

NAME: Person_2
His mother is the Chosen One. I
was sent to summon her. The Black
Falcon got to her first. He has
the Kragle.

NAME: Person_4
Oh my. That is grave news indeed.
But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm
sure the active MasterBuilders are
more than adequate.

NAME: Person_2
The other MasterBuilders are gone.

NAME: Person_4
I guess I'm not redundant anymore.

NAME: Person_1
Why is he being so weird?

NAME: Person_4
The Black Falcon was my student.

NAME: TEEN Person_3
Hey Rod. What's that?

NAME: TEEN Person_5
An awesome secret lair, b'doy!
It's the best thing I've ever
built. It's perfect. All I need
now is a cool nickname.

NAME: TEEN Person_5
No! My precious precious work!

NAME: LESS OLD Person_4
Building is rebuilding, Rodrigo.
You must learn to embrace the
practice, not the outcome.

NAME: TEEN Person_5
What a bunch of bunk! That thing
was AWESOME!

NAME: Person_4
They were probably right.

NAME: Person_1
You taught my parents...

NAME: Person_4
Your mother went into hiding to
protect you. Your father never had
a chance...

NAME: Person_2
Vitruvius, you can still help us.

NAME: Person_4
That's flattery, my dear. We both
know you're only here because you
have no other place to go.

NAME: Person_1
We're here because we don't know
what to do and you might. Sir, all
I've ever wanted was to get along
with everyone and be a part of the
world and now I don't know if
there's going to be a world to be
a part of. That is, unless you
help me fix it. And I bet if you
do, they'll forget all about what
they used to think of you.

NAME: Person_4
I wish I could, young man, but he
has the Kragle, and he has the
Chosen One, and if he has the
Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece.
And without that, there is no--

NAME: Person_2
Hope?

NAME: Person_4
The Kragle is the most powerful
relic of the Maker.

NAME: Person_1
Who is this Maker you guys keep
talking about?

NAME: Person_4
The Maker. The being who put us
all together and watches over us.
Only by following the inspiration
of the Maker can one become a true
MasterBuilder.

NAME: Person_1
Okay that sounds super weird.

NAME: Person_4
It is, but then all the best
things are.

NAME: Person_1
And what's the Kragle again?

NAME: Person_4
Every so often, the Maker drops a
piece down to us that is unique,
unlike any other. This crystal
table is but one example. Some of
them, in the wrong hands, can be
weaponized. The Kragle, if
harnessed, could--

NAME: Person_1
--destroy the world?

NAME: Person_4
Yes. The Black Falcon has taken
your mother, the one person who
can stop him, and imprisoned her.

NAME: Person_4
If we can travel across sea and
land, penetrate his heavily-
guarded fortress, unkidnap Master
Doris, and bring the MasterPiece
safely to her, she can use it to
destroy the Kragle, and set the
world right.

NAME: Person_1
Oh is that all we have to do? That
doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I
forgot to mention, I am saying
this with a sarcastic inflection.

NAME: Person_2
That's super constructive, thank
you.

NAME: Person_4
We need to assemble a team of all
remaining MasterBuilders hiding
throughout the lands. We'll scour
the countryside high and low,
overturning rocks, hiding from
sentries, avoiding the major roads
and air..

NAME: Person_2
We don't have that kind of time!

NAME: Person_4
Or we could send out a mass email
to the MasterBuilders list, and
have whichever ones are remaining
meet us at the midpoint.

NAME: Person_1
Better.

NAME: Person_4
And then, we sail for the Land of
Unused Parts!
Anybody got a ship?

NAME: Person_1
How long has your boyfriend had
his own ship?

NAME: Person_2
Why do you care?

NAME: Person_1
I just think it's interesting that
you're attracted to someone with
his own vessel. Fairly superficial
to date a guy with his own yacht.

NAME: Person_2
It's not exactly a yacht.

NAME: Person_6
Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!

NAME: Person_1
Huh. Not what I expected.

NAME: Person_1
Really not what I expected.

NAME: Person_6
Arr! Come give your weary
boyfriend a kiss!

NAME: Person_1
Wow.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. That's-- okay.

NAME: Person_2
Gosh, where are my manners?
Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my
boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is
Emmet. We used to date a million
zillion years ago. It meant
nothing to me. You have heard of
Vitruvius, of course.

NAME: Person_6
You're the teacher that made the
Black Falcon who he is, then?

NAME: Person_4
That was a long time ago.

NAME: Person_6
Farrr be it for a pirate to judge
a man with an unsavory reputation.

NAME: Person_1
That's surprisingly gracious--

NAME: Person_6
Stay away from me lady.

NAME: Person_1
Alright. Sure.

NAME: Person_6
Say that to my face.

NAME: Person_1
Alright. Sure.

NAME: Person_6
I was once the most feared
MasterBuilder in all the lands. I
lost the rest of me body fighting
off a hundred of the Black Falcon's
men. You cross me, and I'll make it
an even fight, if you follow.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you for your clarity.

NAME: Person_2
He has an incredible mind.

NAME: Person_6
Everyone hop aboard. Meet me crew.
This be Orangebeard, Brownbeard
and Nobeard, and me First Mate,
Chewbacca. You can call him
Allbeard.

NAME: Person_6
The route be stuffed to the gills
with Empura shipping activity.
It's heavily patrolled. We'll
have to be keeping an eye open,
and when the time be right, make
ourrrr move.

NAME: Person_1
What's our move?

NAME: Person_6
I'm sorry, did the Captain say you
could finish swabbing the deck?

NAME: Person_4
Lucy. Welcome.

NAME: Person_1
It's Emmet.

NAME: Person_4
Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?

NAME: Person_1
Yes. What are you doing?

NAME: Person_4
Making.

NAME: Person_1
What's it for?

NAME: Person_4
What is anything for? It's what
we were all meant to do. What the
Maker has fated us to do.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, here's what I don't get. If
our lives really are predetermined
by some all-controlling dude, what
is the point of doing anything?

NAME: Person_1
OW! Why did you do that?!

NAME: Person_4
The Maker fated me to.

NAME: Person_1
Or you did it yourself because
you're a crazy person.

NAME: Person_4
Ah. Now, you're learning.

NAME: Person_1
I could just never make something
like that. How did you even get
the idea?

NAME: Person_4
I didn't. I just opened a window
for it to fly through.

NAME: Person_4
Birds are, incidentally, one of
the most creative of all the
animals. They build nests.
Create elaborate courtship
rituals, make gifts for one
another. And of course, their
beautiful songs.

NAME: Person_1
Teach me.

NAME: Person_4
Open your throat and make a
sound.

NAME: Person_1
No. Teach me to do what you do.

NAME: Person_4
How can I teach you something you
already know? It's already inside
you. You've walled it up, but it
still shines through. That
terrific disaster you caused at
the instruction site? That was no
accident.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not sure I follow...

NAME: Person_4
They say every night the Maker
puts a blanket over the world, a
blanket with tiny holes. Some call
them stars, but I call them
MakerPeepers.

NAME: Person_1
MakerPeepers?

NAME: Person_4
MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a
time, before you were born, when
making new things came as
naturally to everyone as
breathing. The world was messy and
wild, and that made it beautiful.
But then, everything became rigid
and prefabricated, so everyone
just stopped thinking of new
things. Making has been outsourced
to Empura. The Black Falcon has
paved over the world that was.

NAME: Person_4
And yet, somehow, light still
shines through the cracks.

NAME: Person_1
Oh no! Wait!
It got out...

NAME: Person_4
Isn't that marvelous? You have an
idea, and then off it goes!

NAME: Side_2
That's them. Man your weapons.
Full steam ahead.

NAME: Side_17
We don't use steam. We row.

NAME: Side_2
Fine. Full row ahead.

NAME: Person_6
They're a-comin'! Dive!

NAME: Person_1
What are they doing?

NAME: Person_4
Collaborating.

NAME: Person_2
Vitruvius, follow my lead.

NAME: Person_6
Mateys! Be me hands and legs!
Start taking the ship apart!

NAME: Person_1
But we'll sink!

NAME: Person_2
That's the idea.

NAME: Person_6
Put the four-piece over there.
No! The skinny one. Come on!

NAME: Person_1
I don't get it-- What do I do?

NAME: Person_2
Build a hatch.

NAME: Person_1
Like for an attic?

NAME: Person_2
Like for a submarine.

NAME: Person_2
That's as far as you got?!

NAME: Person_1
Well...

NAME: Person_6
Heading?

NAME: Side_40
Arrrrrrrr.

NAME: Person_6
Get deeper. If we're too high
their sensorrrs will detect us.

NAME: Side_2
Nothing? But they were right here.

NAME: Side_17
Wait. There's something on the
scanner.

NAME: Person_6
Dive! Dive! Dive!

NAME: Side_17
Nothing. There's nothing.

NAME: Side_2
Let me see that... DAMMIT!

NAME: Side_17
Hey, watch it man, I built that.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Lucy, you gotta see--

NAME: Side_11
Where are my dang keys? Finn, have
you been playing in here?

NAME: Side_14
No.

NAME: Side_11
You sound like you are lying. Are
you lying?

NAME: Side_14
No.

NAME: Side_11
NAME: Side_41
Okay, this is my very special
area, where I play with something
anyone, because it is the most
awesome thing I have ever made.

NAME: Side_14
Uncle Ted, why don't you have a
girlfriend?

NAME: Side_11
Because you need money for
girlfriends. Although they refuse
to admit that. Although they
admit it implicitly when they
leave you for a banker.

NAME: Side_14
Why don't you have a job?

NAME: Side_11
Look, you can do anything you want
with this big bin of parts, okay?
Just promise me you aren't going
to play in my special areas
anymore.

NAME: Side_14
Okay.

NAME: Side_11
Is that a real okay or a fake one?

NAME: Side_14
Real.

NAME: Side_11
Okay. That's my man.

NAME: Person_4
Legotopia. The last free kingdom
in the universe.

NAME: Person_4
Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
Does the Black Falcon know about
this place?

NAME: Person_4
It's been hidden for ages by the
fog and its remote location. Plus
they have elaborate security
measures.

NAME: Side_22
Who goes there?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex-
girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man,
a pirate head, and a loud dog.
We're here to save the world.

NAME: Side_22
Well, I've never heard of you, but
come on in!

NAME: Person_2
That's the security?

NAME: Person_8
Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my
Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!

NAME: Person_1
For Kreativity...

NAME: Person_8
Exaktly!

NAME: Person_1
Why did you build all this stuff?

NAME: Person_8
Well...Why not?

NAME: Person_8
If you can conceive it, we will
achieve it. Build anything
whenever you feel it.

NAME: Person_1
You know we really don't have time--

NAME: Person_8
Invent a game, like Roller
Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting
Tennis tickets...

NAME: Person_8
Just wide!

NAME: Person_6
This is me favorite sport.

NAME: Person_8
We only teach art and music in
school so kids feel unencumbered.
No spelling, reading, science or
math, we just make up all the
numbers!

NAME: Person_8
Make any idea thought or spoken.
Rules were meant to be broken!

NAME: Person_1
No, rules were meant to be
followed.

NAME: Side_42
We have everything and nothing and
something's all we've got. Why,
you ask? What you should ask is...
Why not?!!!!

NAME: Person_1
You guys are really weird.

NAME: Person_8
Cool, man, thank you.

NAME: Person_1
This is crazy. You can't have a
society without rules. I mean,
your castle doesn't look very
structurally sound at all!

NAME: Person_8
Who is this guy?

NAME: Person_2
Emmet. He doesn't get out much.

NAME: Person_4
Emmet, these people are not
MasterBuilders. They do not create
with purpose, they create just to
create. But they can also be very
inspiring, because the only way to
accomplish the impossible is to
break the rules of what is
possible.

NAME: Person_1
I wish that made sense to me.

NAME: Person_4
It will if you let it.
King Karl, I wish we came to you
with better news.

NAME: Person_8
As do I. The others arrived just
before you, which gave us a chance
to rehearse the song. Follow me.

NAME: Person_6
Ar! What a bounty! I be starrrving!

NAME: Person_8
Meet your team.

NAME: Side_5
Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email.
On my Batphone. Which I invented.
Gets emails. On a phone.

NAME: Person_1
Hello.

NAME: Person_2
And where do you come from?

NAME: Person_2
Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?

NAME: Person_8
No. But he wants to help.

NAME: Side_5
I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot
of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets?

NAME: Person_2
No thank you.

NAME: Side_1
I'm also a MasterBuilder.

NAME: Person_1
Cool!

NAME: Side_1
I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where
are you from? I'm from space.
There's not a lot of oxygen up
there. One time I was fixing my
ship in space and there was a
crack in my helmet. They say I
should've died or gotten Space
Madness but I didn't die. I'm
here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen
my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it
doesn't fly for some reason.

NAME: Person_1
Um, maybe if it didn't have two
fronts and no back, and it didn't
have five wings.

NAME: Side_1
I love wings. Wings are great,
right?

NAME: Person_6
He seems a little distracted.

NAME: Side_1
What? Where?

NAME: Person_2
Is this everyone?

NAME: Side_1
Oh, no. There's one more. My co-
pilot Moppy. He's really organized.

NAME: Side_1
Hi Moppy.
Hi everybody. Did you meet my
friend Benny? He's the best.
That's too nice of you, Mopper.
He can really help you with your
quest.
Well, I don't know.
He gets real lonely sometimes.
Moppy!
It's true. He was all alone in
space. He tried to look for his
space friends but couldn't find
them. No one is left but me. Him.

NAME: Person_1
What did you say you do again?

NAME: Side_1
Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First
Class.

NAME: Person_1
Ah.

NAME: Person_4
We are all that remain of the once
proud society of MasterBuilders.
Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's
not a MasterBuilder, he's just the
son of one. And Lucy, who is still
an intern.

NAME: Person_4
Along with a blind man, a pirate
head, a crazy spaceman, and
Batman...

NAME: Person_4
Together, we form a fellowship of
the MasterPiece. A shining beacon
of possibility, and the only thing
that can counteract the power of
the Kragle. If we can get this
into the hands of the Chosen One--

NAME: Side_2
Or didn't you know that as a
former student of MasterBuilder
academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd
on your mass email?

NAME: Person_8
I'm sorry, I had to let them in.

NAME: Person_2
King Karl! You betrayed us! You
betrayed everything you stand for!

NAME: Person_8
Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia
had run up like a bunch of debt.
Something about lots of spending
and no revenue. Empura promised
to fund the whole place.
Honestly, I'm super sorry.

NAME: Person_1
This guy is supposed to be
inspiring? More like conspiring...
with a bunch of mean jerks who
have my mom! You're just as bad as
them, you big mean jerk!

NAME: Person_8
Come on. Guys.

NAME: Person_8
Where are you taking them? Not to
the dungeon, right? You said--

NAME: Side_2
Do I look like a medieval
constable? No, they're going
someplace much worse. Take them
to... the conference room!

NAME: Side_2
Okay we're good to teleconference.

NAME: Side_43
OH THERE IT GOES! Can you
hear me? How about now? How about now? How

NAME: Side_2
Just, point the camera at you.

NAME: THE Person_5
I can't see anything.

NAME: Side_2
No, the other way. There. That's
close enough.

NAME: THE Person_5
Oh I see you! I see your hand.
Wave your hand. Ha ha! This is
amazing! Do you hear a weird echo
on your end? I can hear myself but
like two seconds later. Echo.
Echo. This is my voiceeeeeoooooo
aaaaayyyyyyyeeeeeeeeeee...

NAME: Side_2
Sir.

NAME: THE Person_5
Okay. Well well well, it looks
like I have you all right where I
want you. Good morning Vitruvius.

NAME: Person_4
Black Falcon! Prepare to meet the
Maker!

NAME: Person_2
No no he's just on teleconference.

NAME: Person_4
What?

NAME: Person_2
It's like a phone. A telegram.
He's not actually in the room.

NAME: Person_4
Like a crystal ball?

NAME: Person_2
Sure.

NAME: THE Person_5
Still being schooled by your
students, I see.

NAME: THE Person_5
I thought you might want to know
that my good friend Doris here is
safe and sound, so you don't have
anything to worry about.

NAME: Person_3
Emmet!

NAME: Person_1
Mom! I'm coming! I won't let you
down. Any more than I already
have!

NAME: THE Person_5
You've done enough, haven't you
sonny? After all, your mother is
now a distinguished member of my

NAME: THE Person_5
Every MasterBuilder in the world
is in this tank, having their
ideas extracted. Now, with the
ideas of the Chosen One, I can
finally build the best
Kraglethingy in the world, freeze
everything, and make the universe
exactly how I like it forever.

NAME: Person_1
Mom! No!

NAME: THE Person_5
There's nothing you can do, dude.
I already have the ideas. My
builders are putting the finishing
touches right now. What are you
going to show up here in the next
twenty four hours and stop me?
You just gave me the only hope you
had! You see this?

NAME: Person_5
These are all the lands I control!
They are perfect! And they are
going to be that way forever! Now
that you can't mess any of them
up! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_2
So wait. What was the purpose of
this call then?

NAME: THE Person_5
To gloat. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha PEACE.

NAME: Person_1
You're a MasterBuilder, too?

NAME: Person_8
I dabble. You were right. I'd
rather be poor and free than
comfortable and stuck.

NAME: Person_8
Bring it on.

NAME: Person_8
Prepare for battle!

NAME: Person_8
On my mark.

NAME: Side_2
Charge.

NAME: Person_8
Charge!

NAME: Person_8
Retreat!

NAME: Person_8
You have to go.

NAME: Person_1
We can't leave you here.

NAME: Person_8
It's my place to be here. Go!

NAME: Side_1
Everyone get in my spaceship!

NAME: Person_1
Over there!

NAME: Person_2
We have to go now!

NAME: Person_1
I built that chair! Check it out.
That's my chair. Pretty good.

NAME: Person_2
That's far more impressive than
this entire Rocket-Copter.

NAME: Person_1
Well, it was my idea to get in the
catapult.

NAME: Person_2
A credit hog. Great.

NAME: Side_5
Where'd this thing come from?

NAME: Person_1
No idea.

NAME: Person_6
Bogey on our six!

NAME: Side_1
Hey look at that over there--

NAME: Person_2
Benny! Focus!

NAME: Person_6
There!

NAME: Person_1
My chair!!!!

NAME: Side_5
I say we camp here for the night
in this creepy Old West Ghost
Town.

NAME: Person_2
What's up?

NAME: Person_1
Can't sleep. Kind of still upset
about everything, you know?

NAME: Person_2
Upset about what?

NAME: Person_1
Well, I got in a fight with my mom
that caused her to get kidnapped
and the whole world is about to
get frozen, if you must know,
unless you were asking that
sarcastically, which I now realize
you were.

NAME: Person_2
Sorry.

NAME: Person_2
We'll find her.

NAME: Person_1
I hope so.

NAME: Person_2
I know it. I know you.

NAME: Person_1
I thought you said I didn't have a
creative bone in my body.

NAME: Person_2
You don't.

NAME: Person_1
That's nice, thank you.

NAME: Person_2
I'm just trying to help.

NAME: Person_1
You know what you are, Lucy?

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
A real pain in the elbow.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
You may not have a creative bone
in your body, but you have a lot
of really really earnest bones.
You always did.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you?

NAME: Person_2
I mean, that day when we were
kids, and you drew the face in art
class, you inspired me. I thought
maybe there was more out there in
the world, and maybe you felt the
same. That's why I asked you out.
But then you ended up like
everyone else and broke my heart,
you know? That I was going one way
and you didn't go with me.

NAME: Person_1
Think of how I felt. My mom
trained me to follow the herd. To
lay low. All I ever wanted was to
fit in, to have friends. And the
funny thing is, maybe I was trying
too hard, but, my whole life, I
never did have any real friends.

NAME: Person_2
We're being so dramatic. It was
eighth grade!

NAME: Person_1
That's the most dramatic time in
anyone's life, right? It's what
made The Black Falcon such a world
class dingaling.

NAME: Person_2
It made a lot of us dingalings.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_2
You know, whenever I doubt myself,
I look into this prism I found
long ago...

NAME: Person_1
It's... beautiful.

NAME: Person_2
I know. It's a relic of the Maker.
When I'm feeling low, I look at
it, and it always makes me feel
like there still is beauty in the
world, and we all have a purpose.
You know what I mean?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I do.

NAME: Person_2
Well, good night.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Okay.

NAME: Person_9
Finn? What did you do to the
spaceship? It's in pieces! I
told you not to play with this and
you broke it! It took me years to
build all this!

NAME: Person_9
And what's it doing in the Old
West Town? And is that Batman? It
doesn't belong here!

NAME: Side_8
I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just
wanted to play.

NAME: Person_9
Well, life isn't all play.
Sometimes it's serious and it gets
screwed up and you don't feel like
playing. You just wish for once
everything was in the right place.

NAME: Person_4
I don't suppose this is the
restroom?

NAME: Person_1
No. Definitely not.
Hey, Can I ask you something? I
keep having these strange dreams
about a squishy bumpy giant--

NAME: Person_4
Visions of the Maker. Quite
unusual.

NAME: Person_1
What does it mean? Do I have a
fate?

NAME: Person_4
We all have a fate. But
MasterBuilding is about channeling
the power of the Maker, and taking
that fate into our own hands. I
guess it could mean what you
choose to make it mean.

NAME: Person_1
Why do you always talk in weird
riddles? I just want answers.

NAME: Person_4
Then why don't you try building
something for yourself?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, that's lame.

NAME: Person_4
Not bad. You're learning now.

NAME: Person_1
No I'm not. I'm just copying what
you did.

NAME: Person_4
A dilettante borrows. A true
artist steals.

NAME: Person_1
That makes no sense!

NAME: Person_4
And all this does?

NAME: Person_2
How the heck are we going to do
this?

NAME: Person_1
It's okay. I have a plan.

NAME: Person_2
Really?

NAME: Person_1
This R2 unit had the plans for
Empura Tower stored in its memory
bank.

NAME: Person_2
That's convenient.

NAME: Person_1
Looking over it last night, I
noticed the tower follows the same
construction principles as the
condos I was building back in
Legopolis.

NAME: Person_1
Wait.

NAME: Person_2
What about this?

NAME: Person_2
Darn.

NAME: Person_4
How about this?

NAME: Person_4
What, is it because I'm blind?

NAME: Side_5
Check this out:

NAME: Person_2
Stop it! Everyone!

NAME: Person_4
Creativity in groups is hard.

NAME: Person_2
We don't have time for that.

NAME: Person_1
Or we can just wing it.

NAME: SERVICE Side_9
Well, I don't know, I've lived
alone a long time, and sharing
space with you is a new thing for
me...no it's not like that...
Hey, we didn't order any--

NAME: Person_2
I love you please move in with me.

NAME: Person_1
The Black Falcon's office!

NAME: Side_5
My office is bigger.

NAME: Person_2
Emmet.

NAME: Person_6
Arr, his appointment book be
saying he be scheduled for a
massage at four.

NAME: Side_5
He'll get a flipping massage
alright.

NAME: Side_18
Language! There are kids here.

NAME: Side_5
Who are these nerds?

NAME: Side_23
We, uh, can't move.

NAME: Person_2
They won't budge.

NAME: Side_24
The bad guy is going to freeze
everyone.

NAME: Side_25
Kids? Are you okay?

NAME: Side_18
They're alright, baby.

NAME: Side_23
I miss you, mom.

NAME: Person_1
Me too.
This is really sad. How can you
keep living like this?

NAME: Side_18
Well, yeah, we can't be together.
We can't touch or see each other.
But in here-- and if I could, I'd
be pointing to my head-- I'm not
stuck. In my brain we're sharing
a delicious meal together.

NAME: Side_25
Thank you sweetie.

NAME: Side_24
Pass the mustard.

NAME: Person_2
That's pretty elaborate.

NAME: Side_18
They can freeze you. They can tell
you what to do. But they can't
stop our secret weapon. Ideas.
Now go give `em hell.

NAME: Person_1
Wait. Batman, give me your
Batperiscope.

NAME: Person_1
Now at least you can see each
other.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
You there. Listen to me.

NAME: Side_9
You have grown a beard.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
I be trying it out. What do ye
think?

NAME: Side_9
It's very nice.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
Thank you. Arr.

NAME: Side_9
Is there something in your throat,
sir?

NAME: "THE Person_5"
Yes. It be a new throat something
I'm trying out. Do ye like it?

NAME: Side_9
Very much.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
Say, I beed wondering if you could
do me a favor.

NAME: Side_9
At your service, commander.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
Take off your ninja clothes.

NAME: Side_9
Sir?

NAME: "THE Person_5"
I be the boss, ain't I be?

NAME: Side_9
Yes, sir.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
Now pull each other's heads off
and kick them way down the hallway
where you can't see them anymore.

NAME: Side_9
Yes, sir-- ow!

NAME: "THE Person_5"
Very good. Now count to one
thousand.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
This be awesome.

NAME: Side_45
Black Falcon? You're supposed to
be at your massage.

NAME: "THE Person_5"
I uh...

NAME: Person_1
Mom...

NAME: Person_3
What? Emmet?

NAME: Person_1
It's me, Mom. I've here to save
you, so you can save the world.

NAME: Person_4
Rodrigo Falcone. My old student.
It's time you went back to SCHOOL!

NAME: Person_5
The old dog still has a few
tricks. But I guess your friends
didn't tell you that I was flanked
by like a hundred soldiers. Now!

NAME: Person_5
Get the rest of them!

NAME: Person_2
Why won't anything in this hallway
break off?!

NAME: Side_5
It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!

NAME: Person_6
Lucy.

NAME: Person_2
Yes?

NAME: Person_6
I want you to know, I love you.

NAME: Person_2
Me too...

NAME: Person_6
And even if the world be ending,
and we all get frozen, I'd feel
better about the whole situation
if I could get frozen with you as
my bride.

NAME: Person_2
Are you really doing this?

NAME: Person_6
Lucy. Will you take me hand in
marriage? Metaphorically.

NAME: Person_2
Um...

NAME: Person_6
Lucy!

NAME: Person_1
Mom! Hurry!

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Person_3
No!

NAME: Side_5
We can't win this. We've got to
hide and make a new plan.

NAME: Person_6
Arrr!

NAME: THE Person_5
Aw how cute. Mother and son...
together at last. And what's this?

NAME: THE Person_5
I've been looking for a
paperweight.
Did you really think you were
going to come up here and save the
day? You're a follower, my
friend. You don't have the stuff.
And you. You must be real proud
of this one, huh? He's a credit
to the family. Just like his
talentless father.

NAME: Person_1
Mom, I'm so sorry.

NAME: Person_3
I know sweetie.

NAME: Person_1
Just- tell me everything's going
to be okay.

NAME: Person_3
I wish I could, son.

NAME: Person_1
Mom... Why didn't you -- why
didn't you teach me what you knew?

NAME: Person_3
I wanted you to be safe. I thought
you would be happier. When I saw
you with that funny drawing, it
was so marvelous. And then I
thought of what your life would
be, how everyone would treat you.
I just couldn't let that happen.

NAME: Person_1
I know you're the Chosen One, but--
I just wish you had let me choose
for myself.

NAME: Person_3
I...I don't know what to say.

NAME: THE Person_5
You guys want to see it? Let me
take you up to the construction
site! Things are about to get a
little sticky down here.

NAME: Person_1
They got promoted...

NAME: THE Person_5
Behold: The SuperKragleThingy
Part II.

NAME: THE Person_5
It's my best work.

NAME: Person_1
But you didn't do anything.

NAME: THE Person_5
Are you kidding? You think the
MasterBuilders just up and forced
themselves to think of this? Did
those guys force themselves to
build it? No. I did. Ergo, it's
mine.
Look down there.

NAME: THE Person_5
Magnificent, isn't it? And now it
will be just the way I want.

NAME: THE Person_5
Release the Kragle!

NAME: Side_5
That does not look good.

NAME: Person_6
When do we get to the part about
coming up with a plan?

NAME: Side_1
I've got a plan.

NAME: Person_6
Uh-oh.

NAME: Person_6
What about Lucy and the others?

NAME: Side_1
We'll come back for them. After we
stop that Kragle.

NAME: Side_1
Can we go in the blue one?

NAME: Side_2
There they are!

NAME: Person_6
What does it matter?

NAME: Side_1
I fly better in blue.

NAME: Side_2
No! Re-open the door! Everyone in
ships! Go!

NAME: ROBOSide_9
Dude, you don't have to yell.

NAME: THE Person_5
Left. Right. Straight. Now
stand up super tall and scary!

NAME: Side_47
Every time!--

NAME: Person_5
Bahahahahahahaha!!

NAME: Person_3
It's too horrible to bear.

NAME: Person_4
What is? Describe it to me. I
feel really really left out!

NAME: Person_1
The world is ending.

NAME: Side_5
Go down to the city! What are you
doing?

NAME: Side_1
Calling for help from my space
friends!

NAME: Person_6
What, a bunch of mops? There be no
space friends! Just go!

NAME: Side_1
Alright, you don't have to be mean
about it.

NAME: Side_6
< SIGH > Of course.

NAME: Side_15
What the heck is happening?

NAME: Side_6
I think a big dinobot is freezing
everything with mucusy sneezes.

NAME: Side_15
So we're doomed? What do we do?

NAME: Side_6
I don't know. Complain?

NAME: Side_6
I mean, it's not like we can do
anything.

NAME: Side_15
How annoying.

NAME: Side_6
Wait a minute...

NAME: Side_15
What are you doing?

NAME: Side_6
I don't know exactly. I'm just
going with it.

NAME: Side_15
Larry. My goodness.

NAME: THE Person_5
What?! This is terrible! I can't
see!
No offense.
Who the heck did that?

NAME: Person_2
That guy?!

NAME: THE Person_5
Hey! Guys! Swipe! Swipe! No!
You're doing it wrong! Ugh...
This is a disaster!

NAME: Person_5
Do I smell something burning? It
smells like a tire fire in here.

NAME: Person_3
I... don't know what to do. So
tired...

NAME: Person_2
She's too weak. You have to do it.

NAME: Person_1
Do what? What can I do?

NAME: Person_2
I believe in you, Emmet. I was
mad because you disappointed me
for a while, but since it wasn't
your fault, I'm willing to give
you a mulligan on it.

NAME: Person_1
A what?

NAME: Person_2
A mulligan. It's from golf.

NAME: Person_1
You play golf?

NAME: Person_2
The point is, you've spent your
whole life wanting to fit in and
have friends, by pretending to be
something you're not. But now that
you've let the real you shine
through, you've made some friends
who like you for who you are. And
even if they're just a crazy
spaceman and a pirate head and a
blind man and an intern--

NAME: Person_1
You like me?

NAME: Person_2
I do.

NAME: Person_1
Neckbeard likes me?

NAME: Person_2
...Sure.

NAME: Person_1
But... I'm not the Chosen One.

NAME: Person_2
You wanted to make your own
choices, right? So choose
yourself.

NAME: Person_1
Nuh uh.

NAME: THE Person_5
Wait, what's going on?! What the
hell are you smiling about?!

NAME: Person_1
This.

NAME: Person_3
What is it, Emmet?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know. It just came to me.

NAME: Person_4
You have channeled the Maker and
chosen your fate. You have chosen
to be the Chosen One.

NAME: THE Person_5
You are going to defeat me by
making some kind of art? Ha ha
ha! Oh let me put on my Pink
Floyd album so I can totally zone
out! Ha ha ha this is so lame!

NAME: Person_5
Whoa. That was weird.

NAME: Side_6
What the heck is that?!

NAME: Side_1
Wow, that thing is really big.

NAME: Person_6
Uh, Benny...

NAME: THE Person_5
Get that spaceship out of there! I
don't want to freeze space stuff
in the city--OOF!

NAME: Person_2
What do we do?

NAME: Person_3
Go after him.

NAME: THE Person_5
If you want to get something done,
you have to do it yourself!!!

NAME: Side_6
Quick, everyone! Run behind it!
Get away from the mist!

NAME: Side_26
It's a b--

NAME: Person_1
So...not square.

NAME: Person_1
The Maker. It's all real...

NAME: Person_1 Person_9
It just tried to kill me! It just tried to kill me!

NAME: Person_9
What the heck are you?!

NAME: Person_1
What the heck are you?!

NAME: Person_9
I'm a person.

NAME: Person_1
I'm a person. You on the other
hand are a giant squishy beast.

NAME: Person_9
You're a talking toy. This is
considerably less cute than I have
been led to believe.

NAME: Person_1
So ugly...

NAME: Person_1
What are these?!

NAME: Person_9
Calm down! Where did you come
from?

NAME: Person_1
Did you build that?

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, but it's seriously messed
up.

NAME: Person_1
Are you the Maker?

NAME: Person_9
The what?

NAME: Side_8
What?

NAME: Person_9
Are you seeing this?

NAME: Side_8
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Two Makers?

NAME: Person_9
How did this-- what is-- my sets,

NAME: Side_8
The guys. They needed my help.

NAME: Person_9
Against what?

NAME: Side_8
Against the Kragle.

NAME: Person_9
The what?

NAME: Person_1
The Kragle. The thing that is
freezing everything together.

NAME: Person_9
Oh. Krazy Glue?

NAME: Person_1
Good Lord.

NAME: Person_9
What? I'm using this to glue my
set together. So it won't get
messed up by the kid.

NAME: Person_1
But then-- it can never change.

NAME: Person_9
Exactly. It's the only thing in
my life that's perfect.

NAME: Person_9
I can't find a job that doesn't
make me hate myself. My
girlfriend dumped me for a rich
trustafarian... dingaling, is what
he is, and I'm watching my
sister's kid while she has a fun
time partying in the Hamptons with
her annoying brood of hot
girlfriends who won't have a thing
to do with me, and the only thing
I have in my life that makes any
sense, that I have any control
over is that perfect world right
there.

NAME: Person_1
But... nothing is perfect unless
it can change. You can make
something, you know, and it can be
great, for a while, but then...
then someone maybe adds to it,
makes something new out of it. And
that keeps happening until it
becomes something that a single
person could never envision. Truth
is, creating alone is never as
good as creating with others.

NAME: Person_9
See. No. That's not true-
because with others, they don't
see things the same way, so--

NAME: Person_1
I know. You want to control
everything. I get it. But if you
succeed, in the end, all you'll
ever have is what you've got.

NAME: Person_9
What else could I have?

NAME: Person_1
Who knows? That's the best part.

NAME: Person_9
Use this.

NAME: Person_1
What is it?

NAME: Person_9
What is it? It's the ca--

NAME: Side_8
Cone of Power. It's called the
Cone of Power.

NAME: Person_9
Okay. The Cone of Power.

NAME: Side_8
Put it on the Kragle to stop it.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah. Try that.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you. It was nice to meet
you both, disgusting squishy giant
Maker creature and smaller,
messier giant Maker creature.

NAME: Side_8
Nice to meet you.

NAME: Person_1
I should go save the world now.

NAME: Person_9
Let's play.

NAME: THE Person_5
Detach and mobilize! Stop that
loser!

NAME: Side_1
Hello!

NAME: Person_1
Thanks for dropping in.

NAME: Side_5
I hope we're not imposing.

NAME: Side_5
There's too many of them!

NAME: Person_6
They're coming at us from all
sides!

NAME: Side_1
Guy! Look up! My space friends!
They got my message!

NAME: Side_49
Anything for you, Benny!

NAME: Person_6
Lucy!

NAME: Person_2
Neckbeard! We need to talk...

NAME: Side_6
I could build such a better ship
than that.

NAME: Side_15
Why don't we?

NAME: THE Person_5
Didn't your mom tell you? She
designed this thing with a missile
launcher!

NAME: Person_3
Emmet!

NAME: Person_2
Doris, are you okay back there?

NAME: Person_2
Doris?! Why did she do that?

NAME: Person_4
The connection between a mother
and son is a powerful thing.

NAME: Person_2
But it's certain death.

NAME: Person_4
On the contrary. It's connections
like those that give the best
chance to survive...

NAME: Person_3
Get your hands off my flipping
son.

NAME: Person_1
Mom... Wow. Just... wow.

NAME: Person_3
I'm the Chosen One, remember?

NAME: Person_1
I guess that makes two of us.

NAME: Person_3
this time I was trying to keep you
from getting hurt, so I told you
so glad that I get to see the
beautiful waves you finally get to

NAME: Person_1
NAME: THE Person_5
Aw. That's sweet. I want to take
a picture so I can remember you
like this FOREVER!

NAME: Person_1
Lucy? How did you do that?

NAME: Person_2
I used a few connections.

NAME: Person_3
Emmet, now's your chance!

NAME: THE Person_5
Nuh-uh-uh. One step closer, and
bye-bye mommy. Now go away, you
freak, you weirdo, you loser. You
don't belong here. You don't
belong anywhere.

NAME: Person_1
You're right. I don't belong
here...

NAME: Person_1
I belong here!

NAME: THE Person_5
No!

NAME: Person_1
Rest in pieces.

NAME: Side_26
--oy!

NAME: Side_50
Thank God!

NAME: Person_2
What the heck just happened?

NAME: Person_1
Something totally foofy.

NAME: Person_1
--is it just me, or is it getting
crazier out there?

NAME: Person_6
It's certainly tense. People are
upset, they're struggling. Looking
for work. The garbage strike seems
like it's been going on forever.
These are tough times.
How 'bout you. How's the job? Still
enjoying it?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I   mean, it's different each
day, so   I really like that. I don't
think I   could ever work in an
office.   Behind a desk.

NAME: Person_1
No offense.

NAME: Person_6
Have you been keeping up with your
journal?

NAME: Person_1
Everyday.

NAME: Person_6
Great. Did you bring it with you?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. Did I bring what?

NAME: Person_6
(impatient; she doesn't
have time for this)
Arthur, last time I asked you to
bring your journal with you. For
these appointments. Do you have it?

NAME: Person_1
Yes ma'am.

NAME: Person_6
Can I see it?

NAME: Person_1
I've been using it as a journal,
but also a joke diary. Funny
thoughts or, or observations-- Did
I tell you I'm pursuing a career in
stand-up comedy?

NAME: Person_6
No. You didn't.

NAME: Person_1
I think I did.

NAME: Person_6
Oh yeah. Because of what your
mother said,-- about your purpose.
"To bring laughter and joy to the
world," right?

NAME: Person_1
Right.

NAME: Person_1
I didn't realize you wanted to read
it.

NAME: Person_6
"I just hope my death makes more
sense than my life."

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I mean, that's just--

NAME: Person_6
Does my reading it upset you?

NAME: Person_1
No. I just,-- some of it's
personal. You know?

NAME: Person_6
I understand. I just want to make
sure you're keeping up with it.

NAME: Person_6
What about your mom? How's she
feeling?

NAME: Person_1
She has good days. But mostly bad.
It's been a big help having me
there. She really needs me.

NAME: Person_6
Seems like she's been sick a lot
since you got home.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, it's good I'm there. When I
was in the hospital, after my last
episode-- she was having trouble
getting over there to visit.

NAME: Person_6
All right. So, I'll see you again,
two weeks from today?

NAME: Person_6
Is there something else I can help
you with, Arthur? My next
appointment is waiting.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I was wondering if you could
ask the doctor to increase the
dosage on my medications? Nothing
seems to make a difference.

NAME: Person_6
Do you know which ones you'd like
increased?

NAME: Person_6
Have you been sleeping?

NAME: Person_1
Some.

NAME: Person_6
Arthur, you're on seven different
medications. Surely they must be
doing something.

NAME: Person_1
I just don't wanna feel so bad
anymore.

NAME: Side_11
(turns back to Joker;
already annoyed)
Can you please stop bothering my
kid?

NAME: Person_1
I wasn't bothering her, I was--

NAME: Side_11
Just stop.

NAME: Side_11
You think that's funny?

NAME: Person_2
Wait!!

NAME: Person_2
Thank you.
Of course it's you,-- everyone else
in this building is just so fucking
rude.

NAME: Person_2
How's your mom doing?

NAME: Person_1
It's day to day. I'm doing
everything I can to get her back on
her feet.
Picked up her medicine. Gonna make
her some dinner.

NAME: Person_2
She's lucky she has you--

NAME: Person_2
Jesus. Don't do that, GiGi! How
many times have I told you that?
This building is so awful, isn't
it?

NAME: Person_2
Okay. Well, tell your mom I said
hello.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Sophie--

NAME: Person_1
I'll tell my mom you said hello.

NAME: Person_3
(shattering the moment,
calls out)
Happy?! Did you check the mail
before you came up?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, Ma. Nothing. No letter.

NAME: Person_3
You sure you looked? Sometimes I
don't know where your head is.

NAME: Person_1
Yes I'm sure. And my head's right
here. I'm gonna make you some
dinner, okay?

NAME: Person_3
He must not be getting my letters.

NAME: Person_1
He's a busy man.

NAME: Person_3
Too busy for me? I worked for that
family for 12 years. He always had
a smile for me. Least he could do
is write back.

NAME: Person_1
Ma, eat. You need to eat.

NAME: Person_3
You need to eat. Look how skinny
you are.

NAME: Person_3
All day long it's more bad news.
That's all there is.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe you shouldn't watch so much
television.

NAME: Person_3
He's the only hope for Gotham.
He'll make a great mayor. Everybody
says so.

NAME: Person_1
Everybody who? Who do you talk to?

NAME: Person_3
Well everybody on the news.

NAME: Person_1
Stop it. He's not even gonna run.
Why would Thomas Wayne want to be
mayor? He can do more good as a
businessman.

NAME: Person_3
Because he cares about this city.
And everyone in it-- that's why I
can't believe he hasn't written me
back.

NAME: Person_1
He will. Now eat some dinner.

NAME: Person_1
How you feeling today?

NAME: Person_3
I don't know. It always hits me
worse at night, you notice that?

NAME: Person_1
Maybe it's the moon. Maybe you're a
werewolf?

NAME: Person_3
It's not funny.

NAME: Person_3
Anyway, I wrote a new letter today.
A better one. I want you to hand
deliver it to him.

NAME: Person_1
What? Why?

NAME: Person_3
Cause maybe the mailman is throwing
them away. We should have tipped
him at Christmas time.

NAME: Person_1
Who tips their mailman?

NAME: Person_3
Some people do. Rich people do.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. I can try his office.
Tomorrow.

NAME: Person_3
Thank you.
Come sit. It's almost on.

NAME: Person_1
Hello. I have a personal letter for
Mr. Thomas Wayne.

NAME: Side_7
Okay. You can leave it with me.

NAME: Person_1
It's kind of important. I need to
make sure he gets it himself.

NAME: Side_7
Oh, in that case, I'll buzz you
right in.

NAME: Side_7
I'm kidding. Leave it here.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. Right-- well, my mom used to
work for the Wayne family-- for 12
years. She was their housekeeper.

NAME: Side_7
That's great. But you can leave it
with me or you can leave with the
letter. Those are your options. Now
please step aside.

NAME: Person_1
Mr. Wayne knows her. Can you maybe
at least call back to him? Tell him
that I'm here.

NAME: Side_7
Thomas Wayne is away on business.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Well, can I have your name?
So I know who I left it with.

NAME: Person_1
Wait. He's right there.
(goes up to the glass,
shouts)
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne.

NAME: Side_7
Sir. Please stop. Sir!!

NAME: Person_5
You okay?

NAME: Person_5
I heard about the beat down you
took. Fucking savages.

NAME: Person_1
It was just a bunch of kids. I
should have left it alone.

NAME: Person_5
It's crazy out there. And it's only
getting worse.

NAME: Person_1
My mother says that the people
nowadays lack empathy.

NAME: Person_5
What's empathy?

NAME: Person_1
It means like "feeling for other
people."

NAME: Person_5
Like sympathy?

NAME: Person_1
Kind of. But different.

NAME: Person_5
Take it. I got a few. You gotta
protect yourself out there, buddy.
Too many wackos.

NAME: Person_5
It's a .38 snub-nose. Gets the job
done if you ever need to use it.
Usually pulling it out is enough.

NAME: Person_1
I, I don't have the money for this,
Randall.

NAME: Person_5
Don't sweat it. You can pay me some
other time. You're my boy.

NAME: Person_5
But you didn't get it from me,
okay?

NAME: Side_2
Arthur,-- Hoyt wants to see you in
his office.

NAME: Person_1
What for?

NAME: Side_2
No clue.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Hoyt. Gary said you wanted to
see me?

NAME: Side_3
How's the comedy career? Are you a
famous stand-up yet?

NAME: Person_1
Not quite. Haven't even performed
yet. Just been working my material.
This business is all about fine-
tuning.

NAME: Side_3
Right.

NAME: Side_3
Don't sit. This will be quick.

NAME: Side_3
Look, I like you, Arthur. A lot of
the guys here, they think you're a
freak. But I like you. I don't even
know why I like you. I mean, you
don't say much.
It's probably that stupid laugh. It
gets me every time. Kills me.

NAME: Side_3
But I got another complaint. And
it's starting to piss me off.

NAME: Side_3
Kenny's Music. Sunday. The guy said
you disappeared. Never even
returned his sign.

NAME: Person_1
No. I got jumped. I told you about
that.

NAME: Side_3
For a sign? Bullshit. It makes no
sense, just give him his sign back.
He's going out of business for
god's--

NAME: Side_3
Hey!

NAME: Side_3
What the fuck, Arthur?!

NAME: Person_1
I don't have his sign.

NAME: Person_3
--so what did he say when you gave
him the letter?

NAME: Person_1
They wouldn't let me see him.
But they promised me it would get
to him.

NAME: Person_3
It's good they promised. He only
works with the best. We should hear
something soon.

NAME: Person_1
Look up.

NAME: Person_1
Why are these letters so important
to you, Ma? What do you think he's
gonna do?

NAME: Person_3
He's gonna help us.

NAME: Person_1
Help us how?

NAME: Person_3
Get us out of here, take me away
from this place and these-- these
awful people.

NAME: Person_1
You worked for him over 30 years
ago. What makes you think he would
help you?

NAME: Person_3
Because Thomas Wayne is a good man.
If he knew how I was living, if he
saw this place, it would make him
sick. I can't explain it to you any
better than that.

NAME: Person_1
I don't want you worrying about
money. Everyone's been telling me
they think my stand-up is ready for
the big clubs. It's just a matter
of time before I get a break.

NAME: Person_3
Happy, what makes you think you
could do that?

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean?

NAME: Person_3
I mean, don't you have to be funny
to be a comedian?

NAME: Person_3
HAPPY!? What was that?

NAME: Person_1
What?!

NAME: Person_3
It's so loud.

NAME: Person_1
I know. The Americans are really
giving it to the Japs.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. I'll turn it down.

NAME: Person_1
Why didn't Randall tell me the gun
was loaded? He's my friend. With my
luck, I could have killed someone.
I could have killed myself.

NAME: Person_1
I should have killed myself.

NAME: Person_1
I should kill myself.

NAME: Person_1
Hello. I'd like to open an account.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, what are you doing up here?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, hi. That's weird.
(pausing to see if he's
gonna laugh; he's good)
I didn't know you worked at a bank.

NAME: Person_2
Pretty glamorous, right?

NAME: Person_1
Very glamorous. Look at this place.

NAME: Person_1
I'm a comedian. I do stand-up
comedy.

NAME: Person_2
Really? I had no idea.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. You know, I'm always making
funny observations. Always on the
look out for my next bit-- so it
makes sense.

NAME: Person_2
Right. Anyway, is there something I
could help you with?

NAME: Person_1
I said hi to my mom.

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me?

NAME: Person_1
Last week. You said to say hi to my
mom. I did. Made her day.

NAME: Side_14
Everything okay here?

NAME: Person_2
Everything is fine Mr. Slotnick.

NAME: Person_2
(shakes her head; to her
manager)
No. He's not. He's interested in
opening an account.

NAME: Side_14
Great. You just need to fill out a
form. They are back there-- against
the wall.

NAME: Person_1
(covering; trying to act
cool)
Okay. Thank you, sir. And thank you
as well, Miss.

NAME: Person_1
(shouts out, to no one in
particular)

NAME: Person_1
If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet.

NAME: Person_1
If you're happy and you know it,
stomp your feet.
If you're happy and you know it and
you really want to show it, if
you're happy and you know it stomp
your feet.

NAME: Person_1
Hoyt, let me explain.

NAME: Person_1
It was, it was a prop gun. It's
part of my act now.

NAME: Person_1
Randall told you that?

NAME: Person_1
Hoyt--

NAME: Person_1
Say what?

NAME: Person_1
--I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

NAME: Person_1
I'm a fuck up and I'm fired.

NAME: Person_1 SITS ON THE SUBWAY CONTEMPLATING WHAT JUST WENT DOWN,
face still painted, his bag on the seat next to him, along
with his wig.

NAME: Side_19
No thank you.

NAME: Person_1
(shakes his head, stifling
the laughter)
Please. Don't.

NAME: Person_1
Nothing. I have a condition--

NAME: Person_1
No. It's just my stuff. I don't
have anything.

NAME: Person_1
Hi. Do you like to laugh?

NAME: Person_1
Remember how I told you that I'm a
stand-up comedian?
Hi. How are you?

NAME: Person_1
Hi. Do you like to laugh?

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
(continuing without taking
a breath)
Remember the other day when I told
you about my stand-up comedy. Well,
I'm doing a set next Thursday and
I'm inviting a bunch of my friends
and I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to come and check it out.

NAME: Person_1
Were you crying? Why are you
crying?

NAME: Person_2
I had a bad day.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. I, I didn't--

NAME: Person_2
It's okay. How would you know.

NAME: Person_1
What happened?

NAME: Person_2
I got fired. From the bank.

NAME: Person_1
What for?

NAME: Person_2
Because,-- I don't know. It doesn't
fucking matter. I don't know what
I'm gonna do.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Well, all the info is right
there on the flyer.

NAME: Person_1
You know they say laughter is the
best medicine.

NAME: Person_2
Is that what they say?

NAME: Person_6
We spoke about this last time,
Arthur. You're supposed to bring
your journal with you.

NAME: Person_1
Well I didn't think you were going
to read it.

NAME: Person_6
You said it didn't bother you.

NAME: Person_1
I lied. Everything bothers me.

NAME: Person_6
What about it bothered you?

NAME: Person_1
It's personal. It's my private
thoughts. Plus it contains original
comedy material that I don't feel
comfortable handing over to you.

NAME: Person_6
Arthur, I have some bad news for
you.

NAME: Person_6
They've cut our funding. We're
closing down our offices next week.

NAME: Person_1
So where will we be meeting?

NAME: Person_6
We won't be. The city's cut funding
across the board. Social services
is part of that.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_6
They don't give a shit about people
like you, Arthur. You don't have a
voice and they don't really care
what happens to you or to us for
that matter.

NAME: Person_1
How am I gonna get my medication?

NAME: Person_3
Happy! Come in here. Thomas Wayne
is on TV.

NAME: Person_3
Quick! Come.

NAME: Person_3
They're interviewing him about
those horrible murders on the
subway last week.

NAME: Person_1
Why are they talking to him?

NAME: Person_3
You hear that! I told you. We're
family.

NAME: Side_15
This next comic describes himself
as a lifelong Gotham resident who
from a young age was always told
that "his purpose in life was to
bring joy and laughter into this
cold, dark world." Ummm. Okay.

NAME: Side_15
Please help me welcome Arthur
Fleck!

NAME: Person_1
(trying to stop himself
from laughing)
-- good evening, hello.
(deep breath; trying to
stop laughing)
Good to be here.
I, I hated school as a kid. But my
mother would always say,--
(bad imitation of his mom,
still laughing)
"You should enjoy it. One day
you'll have to work for a living."
"No I won't, Ma. I'm gonna be a
comedian!"

NAME: Person_1
So, did you laugh? Really couldn't
see much from up there.

NAME: Person_2
Of course. Yeah. You couldn't hear
anything?

NAME: Person_1
All I heard was my heart pounding.

NAME: Person_2
It was good. I really needed to get
out of my apartment so, thanks.
What happened to the rest of your
friends?

NAME: Person_1
What friends?

NAME: Person_2
Didn't you say some of your friends
were coming?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I decided not to invite them.
As a performer sometimes you want
to see how a "real" crowd reacts.
People who don't already love me,
or, or have a notion of who I am,
you know?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. I get that.

NAME: Person_2
You believe that shit?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah,-- I don't know how something
like that happens.

NAME: Person_2
Please. I'll bet you five bucks
those rich assholes deserved it.

NAME: Person_1
You think?

NAME: Person_2
Look at their faces. Those smug
smiles. I've seen that look. Fuck
them.

NAME: Person_2
The guy who did it is a hero. Three
less pricks in Gotham City. Woo-
hoo! Only a million more to go.

NAME: Person_1
Hey. You want to get some coffee?

NAME: Person_2
--I'm telling you, it's across the
board. Wall Street, the banks,
politicians. They've been making a
killing for years. Fuck them.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know.

NAME: Person_2
What don't you know?

NAME: Person_1
Not all of them are awful. Take
someone like Thomas Wayne for
example. He's a hero.

NAME: Person_2
Oh c'mon, he's the worst!

NAME: Person_1
Sophie, he's the only one who can
save this city.

NAME: Person_2
You can't be serious!? He's a
complete narcissist. Brags about
his money. Meanwhile, the rest of
us can barely make rent. Or feed
our kids.

NAME: Person_1
What happened?

NAME: Person_2
With what?

NAME: Person_1
With your job. At the bank?

NAME: Person_2
Oh. Yeah, I was, um,--

NAME: Person_1
We don't have to talk about it.

NAME: Person_2
Have you ever been fired before?

NAME: Person_1
Every time.

NAME: Person_2
And have you ever wanted to torch
the place?

NAME: Person_1
Every time.

NAME: Person_2
Right. And this was like the first
good job I had in like, years. Not
waitressing or anything like that.
It was 9-5. I had benefits. You
know what that means when you have
a kid?

NAME: Person_2
But from the very first day, the
manager guy starts smiling at me,
whispering in my ear, touching me,
trying to get me to sleep with him--

NAME: Person_1
Did you do it? Did you go to bed
with him?

NAME: Person_2
Fuck no. The guy's a fucking pig.
So finally I complained to his
boss, and they fired me... And now,
now I don't know what to do with
myself.

NAME: Person_1
Right. Wait, what do you mean?

NAME: Person_2
I finally felt good. Like I had a
future. A purpose. And now I don't
even know how I'm gonna pay my
rent.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. I have this thing--

NAME: Person_2
I know.

NAME: Person_2
How did you get it?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know. I read you can get it
from a brain injury or, or a lesion
in there. My mom said I was born
this way. Born laughing.

NAME: Person_2
Is that why she calls you Happy?

NAME: Person_1
Kind of. That actually started when
I was a kid. The other kids made
fun of me, called me Happy-- but
not in a good way. I got so sick of
it, one day when I was about ten,

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
I took a razor and cut this smile
onto my face.
(she's taken aback as he
points to the scars)
Sort of like "You want happy? Here,
how's this for happy?"

NAME: Person_2
You okay?

NAME: Person_1
I've been thinking about this night
my whole life.

NAME: Person_1
"That's life."

NAME: Person_3
--what, what time is it?

NAME: Person_3
What happened? Did you hurt
yourself again?

NAME: Person_1
What is this? How come you never
told me?

NAME: Person_3
Is, is that my letter? Is that my
letter, Happy?

NAME: Person_1
How could you not tell me, Ma?

NAME: Person_3
You told me you dropped it off.
You have no right opening my mail.
Who do you think you are?

NAME: Person_1
(raising his voice;
excited)

NAME: Person_1
Apparently I'm Thomas Wayne's son!
How could you keep that from me?

NAME: Person_3
Stop yelling at me, you're gonna
kill me, give me a heart attack!

NAME: Person_1
I'm not yelling! I'm just, excited.
How can any of this be real!? How
can Thomas Wayne be my father?

NAME: Person_3
(shouts back from behind
the door)
I'm not talking to you until you
calm down.

NAME: Person_1
(lowers his voice; trying
to sound calm)
Okay. How's this, Mom? Better? Will
you please talk to me?

NAME: Person_1
Please.

NAME: Person_3
He is an extraordinary man, Arthur.
We had a connection. I was so
beautiful then. We were in love.

NAME: Person_3
His wife could see it. She was
jealous from the moment I started
working there. She fired me before
I even knew I was pregnant with
you.

NAME: Person_3
And, I never told him or anybody
because, well, you can imagine what
people would say about Thomas and
me, and, and what they would say
about you.

NAME: Person_1
(eyes still closed, head
leaning against the door)
What would they say, Ma?

NAME: Person_3
That I was a whore, and Thomas
Wayne was a fornicator, and that
you're a little, unwanted bastard.

NAME: Side_2
Hey Art, I heard what happened--
I'm sorry man.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, Hoyt did you wrong, buddy.
Doesn't seem fair.

NAME: Person_1
It was a prop gun. And I didn't
pull it out, it fell out.

NAME: Side_20
So is that part of your new act? If
your singing doesn't do the trick,
you just gonna shoot yourself?

NAME: Person_1
Why don't you ask Randall about it?
It was his idea.

NAME: Side_2
Since when do you use a prop gun?

NAME: Person_5
What? I don't. Stop talking outta
your ass, Art!

NAME: Person_5
I think all his stupid laughing
musta scrambled his brain or
something.

NAME: Person_5
Art! Hold up,--

NAME: Person_5
What the fuck was that about?

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_5
Why would you say that? That, that
it was my idea.

NAME: Person_5
You don't get it, do you, buddy,
that shit that went down on the
subway, that's no joke. They got
clown sketches on the front of
every fucking paper. It's just a
matter of time before the cops come
around.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know anything about it.

NAME: Person_5
(leans in close; lowers
his voice)
Art, you know you're my boy. I'm
not gonna say shit. I just hope you
got rid of that gun. That can't
come back on me, okay?

NAME: Person_1
Randall, I didn't shoot anybody.
That wasn't me. And I don't have
time for this, I got somebody real
important I gotta go see.

NAME: Person_5
You know they're sellin' masks.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_5
They're selling masks of your clown
face,-- based off the description I
guess. It's like a thing now.

NAME: Person_1
What are you talking about?

NAME: Person_5
There's a lot of people in this
city who are happy you did what you
did. If you did it.

NAME: Person_1
Randall. Your nose.

NAME: Person_5
What?

NAME: Side_21
DAY'S TABLOID, a more detailed drawing.

NAME: ANGLE ON Person_1 LOOKING DOWN AT HIS NOTEBOOK, STARING AT A
PHOTOGRAPH OF Side_1 RIPPED OUT FROM A MAGAZINE, taped
to a page. He glances at his distorted reflection in the
window, takes his hand and parts his hair to the side, more
like Thomas Wayne's hair. Maybe there is a resemblance.

NAME: Person_1 IN THE BACK OF A TAXI STARING OUT AT THE COUNTRYSIDE,
at the trees and green grass and blue sky and open spaces
whizzing by. The sun is getting low, bathing everything in a
golden light.

NAME: Side_6
(shouting; slight English
accent)
Bruce! What are you doing? Get away
from that man.

NAME: Side_6
What are you doing? Who are you?

NAME: Person_1
My name's Arthur. I'm here to see
Mr. Wayne--

NAME: Side_6
You shouldn't be talking to his
son. Why did you give him those
flowers?

NAME: Person_1
I, I was just trying to make him
laugh.

NAME: Side_6
Well it's not funny. Do I need to
call the police?

NAME: Person_1
No, please. My mother's name is
Penny Fleck. She used to work here,
years ago. Can you tell Mr. Wayne
that I need to see him?

NAME: Side_6
(color drains from his
face; beat)
You're her son?

NAME: Person_1
Did you know her?

NAME: Person_1
You don't need to cover for them.
I'm sure Mrs. Wayne was very upset
when she found out.

NAME: Side_6
There was nothing to find out
about. Your mother was, was
delusional. She was a sick woman.

NAME: Person_1
No. No, just let me speak to Mr.
Wayne.

NAME: Side_6
Please just go, before you make a
fool of yourself.

NAME: Person_1
Thomas Wayne is my father--

NAME: Person_7
Mr. Fleck, sorry to bother you, I'm
Detective Garrity, this is my
partner Detective Burke.

NAME: Person_7
We had a few questions for you, but
you weren't home. So we spoke to
your mother.

NAME: Person_1
You did this to her?

NAME: Person_7
What? No. We just asked her some
questions and she started getting
hysterical-- hyperventilating,
trouble speaking-- then she
collapsed. Hit her head pretty
hard.

NAME: Person_1
They told me she had a stroke.

NAME: Person_7
Sorry to hear that.

NAME: Person_8
I'm lost. Is something funny?

NAME: Person_1
(laughter choking up in
his throat)
No I,-- I have a, a--

NAME: Person_8
Okay. But we have some questions
for you.

NAME: Person_7
About those subway killings from a
few weeks ago.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know anything about that.

NAME: Person_7
We have an eyewitness who described
a white male, about 6 feet tall, in
clown make up. Or a clown mask.
Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha's, Mr.
Vaughn, and he said you were on a
job the day of the shooting.

NAME: Person_7
He also said you got fired that
day,-- For bringing a gun into the
children's hospital.

NAME: Person_7
You weren't fired?

NAME: Person_1
Not for having a gun. That was prop
gun. Part of my act.

NAME: Person_8
So why were you fired?

NAME: Person_1
They said I wasn't funny.

NAME: Person_1
Now, if you don't mind, I have to
go back and look after my mother.

NAME: Person_8
Hey lemme ask you a question? This
condition of yours,-- Is this real
or is this like some sorta clown
thing?

NAME: Person_1
Clown thing?

NAME: Person_8
I mean, is it part of your act?

NAME: Person_1
What do you think?

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me, I was wondering how I
could check my mother out of here?

NAME: Side_24
What's your mother's name?

NAME: Person_1
Penny Fleck. I'd like to take her
home.

NAME: Side_8
Mr. Fleck, your mother had a
stroke. It's very serious. You
can't "check her out." She's gonna
be here for at least a week.

NAME: Person_1
She's not gonna wanna stay that
long. She doesn't like hospitals.
Or doctors.

NAME: Side_8
I'm sorry to hear that. But she
can't just leave.

NAME: Person_1
I don't like hospitals either.

NAME: Side_8
Listen, I wanted to talk you about
something we noticed in her tox
report. We found heavy traces of
multiple medications in her system.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Thanks.

NAME: Side_8
One of them's perphenazine. It's a
powerful anti-psychotic. If she was
taking that regularly and then
suddenly stopped, the withdrawal
could have contributed to her
stroke. Did you notice any
symptoms?

NAME: Person_1
Symptoms?

NAME: Side_8
Withdrawal symptoms. Nausea...
anxiety... hallucinations.

NAME: Side_8
Do you know how long she's been
taking it?

NAME: Person_1
Can you tell me what those symptoms
are again?

NAME: EXTREME CLOSE ON TV, GRAINY VIDEO OF Person_1'S STAND-UP
PERFORMANCE. Joker on stage smiling behind the microphone,
under the harsh spotlight.

NAME: Side_10
-- I'm sorry to bother you, but can
you settle an argument for us?

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me?

NAME: Side_10
You were the guy on Murray Franklin
last night, right?

NAME: Person_1
No, sorry. Wasn't me.

NAME: Side_10
Except you weren't funny. You
didn't tell any jokes.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know what you're talking
about.

NAME: Side_10
No. It was definitely you, buddy.
You're the guy who couldn't stop
laughing. Murray killed you.

NAME: Person_1
If I were you, I'd walk away from
this table before I strangle all
three of you with that fucking
stethoscope hanging from your neck.

NAME: Side_26
WAYNE HALL, behind steel barricades. Many wearing Joker's
"clown face" mask... A few wave homemade signs, "CLOWN FOR

NAME: Person_1 MAKING HIS WAY THROUGH THE DARK SHADOWS ALONG THE BACK
WALL OF THE AUDITORIUM, looking for Thomas Wayne in the sold-
out black-tie audience--

NAME: Side_1
Can I help you, pal?

NAME: Person_1
What? Yeah. No I, I--

NAME: Side_1
You need to get in here or
something?

NAME: Person_1
Dad. It's me.

NAME: Side_1
Excuse me?

NAME: Person_1
My name is Arthur. I'm Penny's son.
I know you didn't know about me,
and I don't want anything from you.
Well... maybe a hug.

NAME: Side_1
Jesus? You're the guy who came by
my house yesterday.

NAME: Person_1
Yes. But they wouldn't let me in,
wouldn't let me see you. So I came
here. I have so many questions.

NAME: Side_1
Look pal, I'm not your father.
What's wrong with you?

NAME: Person_1
How do you know?

NAME: Side_1
Cause you were adopted. And I never
fucked your mother. What do you
want from me, money?

NAME: Person_1
No. What? I wasn't adopted.

NAME: Side_1
She never told you? Your mother
adopted you before she even started
working for us. She was arrested
when you were four years old and
committed to Arkham State Hospital.
She's batshit crazy.

NAME: Person_1
No. No, I don't believe that.

NAME: Side_1
I don't really give a shit   what you
believe.
But if you ever come to my   house
again, if you ever talk to   my son
again, if I ever even hear   about
you again, I'll--

NAME: Side_1
Are you laughing at me?

NAME: Side_1
You think this is funny?

NAME: Person_1
(tries shaking his head
no; still laughing and
choking)
No, no I have a con--

NAME: Side_1
(interrupting; raising his
voice)
Is this a fucking joke to you?

NAME: Person_1
Sophie?

NAME: Person_9
Sorry for the wait. All our records
that are 10 years or older are
stored in the basement. You're
talking over 30 years ago,-- I had
to do some serious digging.

NAME: Person_9
Like I said, if it's in here, I'm
still gonna need a release from
her.

NAME: Person_1
Can I ask you a question? How does
someone wind up in here? Have all
these people committed crimes?

NAME: Person_9
Some have. Some are just crazy and
pose a danger to themselves or
others. Some just got nowhere else
to go.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I know how that is. Sometimes
I don't know what to do, y'know, I
don't think I can take any more of
this.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, I can't take much more of
this shit either.

NAME: Person_9
Now they talking about more
layoffs, man, we're understaffed as
it is. I don't know what I'm gonna
do.

NAME: Person_1
Last time I ended up taking it out
on some,-- people. Bad shit. I
thought it would bother me but, it
really hasn't.

NAME: Person_9
What's that?

NAME: Person_1
It's just so hard to try and be
happy all the time, y'know, when
everything's going to shit all
around you.

NAME: Person_9
Listen, I'm just an administrative
assistant, like a clerk. I file
paperwork, fill out forms. I don't
really know what to tell you, but
maybe you should see someone-- they
have programs, like city services.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. They cut those. Anyway, I was
just talking to talk.

NAME: Person_9
Here it is,-- Fleck. Penny Fleck.

NAME: Person_1
(saying it out loud for
himself to hear)
So she was a patient here.

NAME: Person_9
Uh-huh. Diagnosed by Dr. Benjamin
Stoner... The patient suffers from
delusional psychosis and
narcissistic personality
disorder... Found guilty of
endangering the welfare of a child--

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_9
You said she's your mother?

NAME: Person_9
I'm sorry, I can't. Like I said, I
can't release this without the
proper forms. I could get in
trouble.
Besides, it's pretty bad.

NAME: Person_1
I can handle bad. I've been on a
pretty bad run myself.

NAME: Person_9
I can't help you. If you want these
records you have to get your mom to
sign a patient disclosure form. I
can have someone mail you one.

NAME: Side_12
We went over this, Penny. You
adopted him. We have all the
paperwork right here.

NAME: Side_12
You also stood by as one of your
boyfriends repeatedly abused your
adopted son. And battered you.

NAME: Person_3
He didn't do anything to me. Or to
my boy. Can I go now, I don't like
hospitals.

NAME: Person_3
That's not true. My apartment
wasn't filthy. I keep a clean
house.

NAME: Side_12
And what do you have to say about
your son?

NAME: Person_3
I'm just glad I got to know him.

NAME: Person_2
What the hell was that? You can't
just walk into my apartment like
that.

NAME: Person_1
No, wait,-- Sophie, we can get
through this, that's why I'm here.

NAME: Person_2
What are you talking about? What do
you think this is?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know. I mean I've never
been with a woman "like that," but,
this feels like a beginning to me.

NAME: Person_2
Arthur, I was just being nice to
you. I felt sorry for you. I have a
boyfriend.

NAME: Person_1
You what? What? What kind of woman
are you? Who does that?

NAME: Person_2
You need to leave. I'm not having
this conversation with you.

NAME: Person_1
Why not?

NAME: Person_2
Go back with your friends, honey.
Mommy's having a grown up talk.

NAME: Person_1
No. Don't listen to her GiGi, you
need to hear this. Your mother's a
bad person. She's a whore, she's
seeing two men at once. You can't
trust her,-- She'll break your
fucking heart.

NAME: Person_1
How come nothing ever comes easy
for me?

NAME: Person_1
Who is this?

NAME: Person_1
Yes.

NAME: Person_1
Murray wants me to come on the
show?

NAME: Person_1
Ma, remember how you used to tell
me that God gave me this laugh for
a reason. That I had a purpose. To
bring laughter and joy into this
fucked up world,--

NAME: Person_1
HA! It wasn't God, it was you or,
or one of your boyfriends,-- how
could you let that happen? What
kind of woman are you? What kind of
mother are you?

NAME: Person_1
What's my real name?

NAME: Person_1
C'mon, Ma, I know I was adopted.
What's my name? Who am I really?

NAME: Person_3
H-h-happ--

NAME: Person_1
(interrupting, snaps at
her)

NAME: Person_1
Happy?! I'm not happy. I haven't
been happy for one minute of my
entire fucking life.

NAME: Person_1
But you know what's funny? You know
what really makes me laugh?

NAME: Person_1
I used to think my life was nothing
but a tragedy, but now, now I
realize it's all just a fucking
comedy.

NAME: Person_1
You wanna hear a joke, Murray?

NAME: Person_1
Knock-knock.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I don't know if I should
cross or uncross 'em. Both feel
completely unnatural.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks for having me on, Murray. I
can't tell you how much this means
to me, it's been a life long dream.
I have a joke for you--

NAME: Person_1
You're right. You're right,
uncrossed is better.

NAME: Person_1
(wiping his eyes;
restrained anger)
You shouldn't be here. It's not
right.

NAME: Person_7
We just came to pay our respects.
Sorry about your mother.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, it's too bad.

NAME: Person_8
Where is everybody?

NAME: Person_1
It's always been just me and her.

NAME: Person_8
We saw you on Murray Franklin.

NAME: Person_1
You saw that?

NAME: Person_7
Yeah. Heard you were on, so we got
a videotape.

NAME: Person_8
I just couldn't tell if you were
actually trying to be funny or not.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, well I guess you didn't get
the joke.

NAME: Person_7
Listen, we need to clear a few
things up, we spoke to the hospital
administrator--

NAME: Person_1
Which hospital?

NAME: Person_8
The Children's Hospital.
The night you were fired. He said
it didn't look like a prop gun, it
was heavy, like a real one. We have
some more questions for you.

NAME: Person_1
I just buried my mother.

NAME: Person_7
We can do it tomorrow. But you need
to come down to the precinct--
first thing in the morning.

NAME: Person_1
(looks down, reading the
card)
Right. Thanks for coming.

NAME: Person_8
Of course.

NAME: Person_1
That was a joke.

NAME: Side_2
Hey Arthur, how's it going? You get
a new gig?

NAME: Person_5
You must be goin' down to that
rally at City Hall. Right? I hear
it's gonna be nuts.

NAME: Person_1
Is that today?

NAME: Person_5
Yeah. What's with the clown-face
then?

NAME: Person_1
My mom died.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah we heard. That's why we're
here. Figured you might wanna go
out, get a drink or something?

NAME: Side_2
We don't wanna bother you. Randall
just thought we should come and pay
our respects.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, we're family. We gotta stick
together.

NAME: Person_1
It's not a good time. I'm in the
middle of something here.

NAME: Side_2
Of course. No problem. Another
time.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah. Another time, then. Oh hey,--
one other thing--

NAME: Person_5
Listen, the cops have been poking
around the shop, they're talking to
all the clowns about those subway
murders and--

NAME: Side_2
They didn't talk to me.

NAME: Person_5
That's because the suspect was a
regular-sized person. If it was a
fucking midget you'd be in jail
right now.
Anyway, Hoyt said they were looking
for me, and, and I just wanna see
what you said. You know, make sure
our stories line up, bein' that
you're my boy and--

NAME: Side_2
What the fuck what the fuck WHAT

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna be on TV tonight. Can you
believe it?

NAME: Person_1
It's okay, Gary. You can go.

NAME: Side_2
Hey, Art?

NAME: CLOSE ON TAKING Person_5'S WALLET OUT OF HIS BLOOD SOAKED
PANTS, pocketing all the cash.

NAME: CLOSE ON BUTT OF A GUN STICKING OUT OF Person_5'S WAISTBAND,
glimpse Joker's hand reaching for it--

NAME: Person_1
Go on. Go. You're free.

NAME: CLOSE ON THE CAT LOOKING BACK AT Person_1 FOR A LONG Person_3ENT,
before scampering off out into the world, leaving him behind
for good.

NAME: Person_7
Hey Arthur, where you going?

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, thought you were coming down
to the station this morning.

NAME: Side_31
NAME: Side_5
--You gotta see this nut for
yourself, Murray. I don't think we
can put him on. With the rioting
out there.

NAME: Person_4
Jesus, Gene, I don't have time for
this. Cindy's been breaking my
balls all day.

NAME: Side_5
She's still mad at you about that
thing?

NAME: Person_4
Three marriages, you'd think I'da
fuckin' learned something.
What do I gotta see? I already know
he's a nut. That's why we're
putting him on, it's a goof.

NAME: Side_5
(just shakes his head, and
smiles)
I'm telling you, you gotta see him,
Murray. I think it's too risky, the
show's too big. It's worth too much
to blow it on this,-- this freak.

NAME: Person_1
(shakes Murray's hand;
effusive)
Murray, I can't believe this is
real, that I'm really here.

NAME: Side_5
It's Mr. Franklin kid, show some
respect.

NAME: Person_4
Oh shut up, Gene.
Murray is fine. I prefer it in
fact. Thanks for coming on the
show.

NAME: Person_1
Are you kidding? Thank you for the
opportunity. I've been watching you
forever. My mother never missed a
show.

NAME: Person_4
So what's with the face? Are you
part of the protests?

NAME: Person_1
No, I don't believe in any of that.
I don't believe in anything. I just
thought it would be good for my
act.

NAME: Side_5
Your act? Didn't you hear that a
kid got killed on the subway and
two cops who were almost beat to
death? You didn't hear about the
dozens of protestors and police
injured in the riots?

NAME: Person_1
No. I hadn't heard.

NAME: Side_5
--the audience is gonna go crazy if
you put him on. It was okay maybe
for a bit, but not a whole segment.

NAME: Person_4
I like it. It's timely. It's edgy.
It's, it's dangerous. The best
comedy is all those things put
together.
We're gonna go with it.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you Murray.

NAME: Person_4
(flashes his bemused
smile; condescending)
Couple rules though,-- No cussing,
no off-color material, we do a
clean show, okay? You'll be on
after Dr. Sally. Someone will come
and get you. Good?

NAME: Person_1
Hey Murray,-- one small thing? When
you bring me out, can you introduce
me as "The Joker"?

NAME: Side_5
What? You don't want to use your
real name?

NAME: Person_1
Honestly, I don't even know what my
real name is.

NAME: Person_1
Besides, that's what you called me
on the show, Murray. A joker.
Remember?

NAME: Person_4
(to Gene; trying not to
crack up)
Did I?

NAME: Side_5
I have no idea.

NAME: Person_4
Well, if you say so, kid. Joker it
is.

NAME: Person_4
You gotta see our next guest for
yourself. Will you stick around?
Maybe you can help, I'm pretty sure
he could use a doctor.

NAME: Side_16
Oh. Does he have sexual problems?

NAME: Person_4
He looks like he's got a lot of
problems.

NAME: Person_4
It's been a crazy few days here in
Gotham, and, I think maybe things
are about to get crazy around here
too. Don't go anywhere folks. We'll
be right back.

NAME: Side_13
Back in 30 seconds.

NAME: Side_9
Okay, cue the clip. We'll come to
it straight out of break.

NAME: Side_13
Five... Four... Three...

NAME: Side_9
Roll clip. Put up the show graphic.

NAME: Person_4
O-kay, you may have seen that clip
of our next guest when we first
played it two weeks ago. Now before
he comes out, I just want to say
that we're all heartbroken here and
sensitive to what's going on in the
city tonight. But, this is how he
wanted to come on the show. So let
me introduce-- The Joker.

NAME: Person_4
So, ahhh, thanks for coming on the
show. But I gotta tell ya, with
what happened at City Hall today,
I'm sure many of our viewers here
in the studio, and at home, might
find this look of yours in poor
taste.

NAME: Person_4
Can you tell us why you're dressed
like this?

NAME: Person_4
(can't help but smile at
Joker's laughing)
Okay. But I'm not sure how any of
this is funny. A lot of those
protesters are going with this
look. City seems to be full of
clowns these days.

NAME: Person_1
(just nods, still
laughing)
Yeah. Isn't it great?

NAME: TECHNICAL Side_9
This guy's got nothing.

NAME: Side_9
(hits the producer's talk
button; into the mic)
Gene, what the hell? You wanna kill
this?

NAME: Person_4
(smiles; trying to save
the interview)
So when we talked earlier, you
mentioned that you aren't
political. That this look isn't a
political statement.

NAME: Person_1
That's right. I'm not political,
Murray. I'm, I'm, I'm just trying
to make people laugh.

NAME: Person_4
How's that goin' for ya? Have you
been working on any new material?
Do you want to tell us a joke?

NAME: Person_4
You brought a joke book?

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Here's one. Knock knock.

NAME: Person_4
Oh god, a knock-knock joke? And you
need to read it?

NAME: Person_1
I want to get it right. Knock
knock.

NAME: Person_4
Who's there?

NAME: Person_1
(looks up from his
notebook)
It's the police, ma'am. Your son
has been hit by a drunk driver.
He's dead.

NAME: Side_9
Okay, ready Camera Two. Take Two.
Ready Three. Three.

NAME: Person_4
(bemused smile;
patronizing)
Right. Sorry. I mean Joker-- you
told me backstage that your
mother's a big fan of the show,
that she never misses it.

NAME: Person_1
That's right, Murray. But she's
dead now.

NAME: Person_4
(goes along with the
"joke")
Hold on. Your mother's dead?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. She is.

NAME: Person_4
Okay. What about your father? Does
he watch the show?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know who my father is,
Murray. Turns out I was adopted and
sexually assaulted by my mother's
boyfriend.

NAME: Side_16
Ahhhh! No, no,-- You can not joke
about that.

NAME: Person_4
(shakes his head;
irritated)
Yeah, that's not funny, that's not
the kind of humor we do on this
show.

NAME: Person_1
(just keeps going, on a
roll)
Sorry. It's been a rough few
months, Murray. I mean, after my
mother died, the police came to
question me at her funeral. Who
does that?

NAME: Person_4
Oh really? Were you a suspect?

NAME: Person_1
Very funny, Murray. No, they came
because I killed those three Wall
Street guys.

NAME: Person_4
Okay. I'm waiting for the
punchline.

NAME: Person_1
There is no punchline. It's not a
joke.

NAME: Side_9
Did he just confess to killing the
Wall Street Three?

NAME: TECHNICAL Side_9
Yeah. I think he did.

NAME: Side_13
(turns to the director,
nods)
He definitely did.

NAME: Side_9
Jesus Christ.
(hits the camera talk
button, into mic)
Camera Three, get in close.

NAME: Person_4
(turns back to Joker; with
gravitas)
You're serious, aren't you? You're
telling us you killed those three
boys on the subway. Why should we
believe you?

NAME: Person_1
I got nothing left to lose, Murray.
Nothing can hurt me anymore. This
is my fate, it was always my fate.
My life is nothing but a comedy.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, I think I understand. You did
it to start a movement, to become a
symbol.

NAME: Person_1
C'mon, Murray, do I look like the
kind of clown who could start a
movement? I killed those guys
because they were awful.
Everybody's awful these days. It's
enough to make anyone crazy.

NAME: Person_4
So that's it, you're crazy. That's
your defense for killing three
young men? Because they were mean
to you?

NAME: Person_1
No. They couldn't carry a tune to
save their lives.

NAME: Person_1
Why is everyone so upset about
these guys? Because Thomas Wayne
went and cried about them on TV?

NAME: Person_4
You have a problem with Thomas
Wayne, too?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I do. Everything comes so
easy for him.

NAME: Person_4
And what's wrong with that?

NAME: Person_1
Have you seen what it's like out
there, Murray? Do you ever actually
leave the studio? Everybody just
yells and screams at each other.
Nobody's civil anymore. Nobody
thinks what it's like to be the
other guy. You think men like
Thomas Wayne, men at ease, ever
think what it's like to be a guy
like me? To be anybody but
themselves.
(shaking his head, voice
rising)
They don't. They think we'll all
just sit there and take it like
good little boys. That we won't
werewolf and go wild. Well, this is
for all of you out there.

NAME: Side_32
That asshole just confessed to
killing those Wall Street guys on
fucking live TV!

NAME: Person_1
You're awful, Murray.

NAME: Person_4
Me? How am I awful?

NAME: Person_1
Playing my video, inviting me on
the show,-- You just wanted to make
fun of me. Well it's easy to laugh
at Frankenstein on a crowded beach,
isn't it? You're just like the rest
of them, Murray. Everything comes
too easy for you.

NAME: Person_4
You don't know the first thing
about me, pal. Look what happened
because of what you did, Arthur,
what it led to. There are riots out
there. Two policemen are in
critical condition, someone was
killed today.

NAME: Person_1
How about another joke, Murray?
What do you get when you cross a
mentally-ill loner with a system
that abandons him and treats him
like trash?

NAME: Person_1
I'll tell you what you get. You get
what you fucking deserve,--

NAME: BACK LIVE IN THE STUDIO, Person_1'S TACKLED BY TWO SECURITY
GUARDS AND SOME STAGEHANDS, still hear screams of terror from
the audience around him.

NAME: STAY ON Person_1'S FACE AS HE HEARS THE POLICE RADIO CRACKLING,
reports of rioters in "Joker" masks setting fires, breaking
windows, looting stores.

NAME: Side_35
STOP. Smoke rising from the wreck. Ferrante & Teicher's piano
only version of "Send in the Clowns" still playing...

NAME: Side_36
You still think we're all fucking
clowns?

NAME: Side_4
What's so funny?

NAME: Person_1
-- just thinking of this joke.

NAME: Side_4
Do you want to tell it to me?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Side_4
Because you don't think I'll get
it?

NAME: Person_1
Because it's personal, it's between
me and him.

NAME: Side_4
Okay. Is the medication working?
How's your sleeping?

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_4
How are you feeling?

NAME: Person_1
Good. Everything's good now.

NAME: Side_4
Have you been writing in your
journal?

NAME: Side_4
Great. I want to make sure you're
keeping up with it.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Side_4
Have you written about your
episode? About what happened?

NAME: Person_1
How I remember it.

NAME: Side_4
Can I see?

NAME: Side_5
I suppose we could just sack him.

NAME: Side_5
Look, I don't hate the man but ...

NAME: Person_Side_26
I know, Gareth. It's the mental strain he inflicts on us all.
How is Professor Bradbury

NAME: Person_Side_26
Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert?

NAME: Side_11
Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we speak,
Milord. An awful thing to say, but when the program's up and
running our, Mr. Bean will become a little less than ....
useful?

NAME: Side_22
Morning, Bean.

NAME: Side_5
Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks
and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell
him.

NAME: Side_11
Seconded.     We could all move to France.

NAME: Side_23
All those in favour.

NAME: Person_Side_26
Come on - settle down everyone.

NAME: Side_12
I'm sorry I'm late.

NAME: Side_12
Steady on, old man. I only ...

NAME: Side_5
Not you, you idiot.

NAME: Side_13
Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.
Circa 1670. Can do?

NAME: Side_13
What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art
stored in that one, curious brain of yours.

NAME: Side_5
Then we are agreed, gentlemen.   He goes.

NAME: Side_12
Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render
Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete.

NAME: Side_11
There's no question.

NAME: Person_Side_26
Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking
the pills.

NAME: Person_Side_26
Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom,
please.

NAME: Person_Side_26
invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second
one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?

NAME: Person_Side_26
Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you
still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge.
Your invaluable thoughts, sir?

NAME: Side_24
Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question.

NAME: Side_13
Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius.

NAME: Side_7
Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom.

NAME: Side_25
What's happening here?

NAME: Person_6
Ahm...

NAME: Person_6
Ah.... Ahm....

NAME: Person_Side_26
You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the

NAME: Person_Side_26
Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news
which will not, I'm afraid...

NAME: Person_Side_26
Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How?
All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long
will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here
will    you, dear boy.

NAME: Person_Side_26
As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South
California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it

NAME: Person_Side_26
Mr. Bean.     Wonderful news. You are going to America.

NAME: MR. Person_6
Ooooh, how lovely.

NAME: Person_Side_26
Ah, Timothy.    You're sacked.

NAME: Person_2
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in
the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.

NAME: Person_4
Great news.

NAME: Side_26
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then

NAME: Side_27
Here we go, sir. You've been moved to l st. class. Apparently
your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're
finally on your way.

NAME: Person_2
So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your
home instead of some expensive hotel.

NAME: Person_4
Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period.

NAME: Person_2
David?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really
like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't
really er ...

NAME: Person_2
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate
attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial

NAME: Person_1
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my
family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course
it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?

NAME: Person_2
Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that?

NAME: Person_1
No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it.

NAME: Person_1
Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with
Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
more.

NAME: Side_14
Hello, David.

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_3
I had to do some last minute stuff.

NAME: Side_14
My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you,
gallery going well?

NAME: Person_1
Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I
think it ....

NAME: Person_3
Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.

NAME: Person_3
Kevin!   You stop that right now!

NAME: Side_14
Great kids.     Good looking too.

NAME: Person_1
You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,
looks-wise.

NAME: Person_1
Ah ... absolutely.

NAME: Person_3
Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get
into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before
the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.

NAME: Person_3
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin

NAME: Person_1
Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's
coming to work at the Gallery, from England...

NAME: Person_1
And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a
while.

NAME: Person_3
There aren't hotels?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for
him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all
that stuff.

NAME: Person_1
I said I'd check with you.

NAME: Person_1
Then I said 'yes'.

NAME: Person_3
Do we know anything about him?

NAME: Person_1
Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ...      at least
2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind
dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the
time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here.

NAME: Person_3
David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_3
It's the last thing we need.

NAME: Person_1
That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a
sensational idea."

NAME: Person_5
Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....

NAME: Person_1
Great, good.

NAME: Person_1
Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back?     Years ago?
No. Course not. Just imagining it.

NAME: Side_28
Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.

NAME: Person_8
Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are
ugly.

NAME: Person_1
What makes you say that?

NAME: Person_8
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan
Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony
Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two
million bucks a year to stay indoors.

NAME: Person_1
Richard Burton was very good-looking.

NAME: Person_8
Welsh.

NAME: Person_1
Sean Connery.

NAME: Person_3
Scottish.

NAME: Person_1
Tom Jones?

NAME: Person_8
Welsh again.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.    No-one's
asking you to go to bed with him.

NAME: Person_3
Bed sounds good though.    Bed sounds great.

NAME: Person_5
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

NAME: Person_1
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

NAME: Person_5
I vote for Bart.

NAME: Person_8
Shut up, Kevin.

NAME: Person_5
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something
about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad?
Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11
mosquitoes, resting.

NAME: Person_8
You know the thing I hate most about children?

NAME: Person_5
Nope.

NAME: Person_8
You.

NAME: Side_8
Police!   Stop or we shoot!

NAME: Side_8
Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers
only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back!

NAME: Side_3
Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of medication at all?

NAME: Side_3
You could certainly use some.

NAME: Person_3
What did they say?

NAME: Person_1
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...

NAME: Person_3
Did you really ask?

NAME: Person_1
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

NAME: Person_3
What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse
me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and
I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
I'll go.

NAME: Person_3
I said, I'11 go.

NAME: Person_8
So. where do your parents live?

NAME: Side_18
My parents are dead.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, so are mine.

NAME: Side_8
Just get him the hell out of here, will ya?

NAME: Side_29
Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
ya know that?

NAME: Person_3
It isn't working any more, David.

NAME: Person_1
I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.
Stupid thing.

NAME: Person_3
No, US.     It's not working any longer -you and me.

NAME: Person_1
Jesus.

NAME: Person_3
I need some time, David. A little time.        It's not just you.
It's partly me.

NAME: Person_8
Thanks a lot, Kevin!

NAME: Person_1
That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London
Airport!

NAME: Side_30
Person_3 is still watching T.V. The volume is getting to Person_1.

NAME: Person_1
Alison, please.

NAME: Person_1
I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's
important.

NAME: Person_3
Go ahead.

NAME: Person_1
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

NAME: Person_3
There were three strawberries.

NAME: Person_1
One.

NAME: Person_3
Liar.

NAME: Person_1
0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.

NAME: Person_1
Ali?    What's wrong?

NAME: Person_3
Your face smells like a foot.

NAME: Person_3
What is it?    Jennifer!

NAME: Person_1
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...

NAME: Person_8
There's a man.    I woke up next to a man ...

NAME: Person_3
NAME: Person_1
It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust
me.

NAME: Person_3
He can't stay here, David.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the
gallery ...

NAME: Person_3
David, I'm serious!

NAME: Person_1
I know you are.   Very serious ... most of the time these days.

NAME: Person_3
Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man
in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? (looks at his
tie) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?

NAME: Person_1
Ah, Mr Bean ...

NAME: Person_6
Excuse me.

NAME: Person_6
Now - can I help?

NAME: Person_7
Two dollars please.

NAME: Person_1
Annie, it's me.

NAME: Person_7
NAME: Person_1
No, Annie, no.    This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with
us.

NAME: Person_7
Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but
for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which
is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.

NAME: Person_7
He doesn't like to say much does he?

NAME: Person_1
Right first time.

NAME: Person_7
I can understand THAT. Neither do I.

NAME: Person_1
You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes
worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep
aesthetic level.

NAME: Side_1Side_26
What do you think?

NAME: Side_20
0h yes - lovely - very nice.

NAME: Side_1Side_26
And what colour would you use for the curtains?

NAME: Side_20
Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a
gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom
would be nice in this yellow ....

NAME: Person_1
Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 182Side_26 to Side_266.
Know it?

NAME: Person_7
Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you
upstairs.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks, Annie.

NAME: Person_1
Better go.    Grierson hates people being late.

NAME: Person_6
Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ...

NAME: Person_1
Why me?

NAME: Person_1
Come on!     Let's go!

NAME: Person_2
must be our professor from across the sea.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, this is Doctor Bean.

NAME: Person_6
Actually I'm not .... er ...

NAME: Person_2
This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.

NAME: THOMAS Person_2
Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....

NAME: Person_2
Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your
eyes on these.

NAME: Person_2
Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check
this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
something?

NAME: Person_1.
They're beautiful, sir.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to
business.

NAME: Person_2
Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery
computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very
exciting stuff ....

NAME: Person_6
Ahm ... NO.

NAME: Person_4
What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'
interactive public guide to the gallery.

NAME: Person_1
It's very good Bernie.

NAME: Person_4
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work
oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the
program to every room in the gallery.

NAME: Person_2
Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?

NAME: Person_2
Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice
President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm,
yes, Doctor?

NAME: Person_6
I'm not actually... um...

NAME: Person_2
... Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps
you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.

NAME: Person_4
Absolutely.     This way, sir.

NAME: Person_2
He's a genius, right?

NAME: Person_1
Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

NAME: Person_2
Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's
job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have
him with us. The whole family's very excited.

NAME: Person_2
Glad to hear it.     Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?

NAME: Person_1
You're not going to ....

NAME: Person_2
Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not,
repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this
morning?

NAME: Person_1
You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir.

NAME: Person_1
Goodnight Annie.

NAME: Person_7
Night.

NAME: Side_6
Gimme the keys!

NAME: Side_6
I said, give me the keys!

NAME: Side_6
But I haven't got a f.....

NAME: Person_6
Ssssh!!!!

NAME: Side_6
I haven't got a gun.

NAME: Side_6
Okay, okay, I'11 do it!

NAME: Side_8
Excuse me.    Mr. er ... Cabbage?

NAME: Side_3
It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.

NAME: Side_3
Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got
the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking

NAME: Side_3
'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.

NAME: Side_3
Mr. Bean.     You lookin' to stay long in California?

NAME: MR. Person_6
Oh, yes.

NAME: Person_1
He was incredible.     This guy is fearless.     He has no fear.

NAME: Person_5
That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is
brainless he has no brain'.

NAME: Person_1
Well, there is that ...

NAME: Person_6
Ahm....

NAME: Person_5
It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and
I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.

NAME: Person_5
Come on, winkle.

NAME: Person_5
It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the
stupid cuckoo.

NAME: Person_6
Click, click, click, click, click ...

NAME: Person_5
How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!!

NAME: Person_5
Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!

NAME: Person_1
Hi,

NAME: Person_3
NAME: Person_1
Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner
that will kill you.

NAME: Person_3
putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?

NAME: Person_1
Sort of half.....

NAME: Person_3
Meaning?

NAME: Person_1
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have
asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

NAME: Person_3
Honestly David, you're so spineless.

NAME: Person_1
Roses.     Wine.

NAME: Person_3
But no real change.

NAME: Person_3
I really do need some time on my own. Away from here.

NAME: Person_1
Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak.
You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.

NAME: Person_3
NAME: Person_1
Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer -
could you turn that damn thing down.

NAME: Person_3
No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ...

NAME: Person_5
I wish I    could use    that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard
feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used
to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you
around in    a couple    of years, maybe".

NAME: Person_8
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.

NAME: Person_1
Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?

NAME: Person_8
It's you and Mom that need to talk.

NAME: Person_1
Sure.    You're right.

NAME: Person_5
You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are
you, Dad?

NAME: Person_5
Are you?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, I am.    I must.

NAME: Person_6
Enter.

NAME: Person_1
Hi, am I disturbing you?

NAME: Person_1
May I?

NAME: Person_1
None of your folks here - Family?

NAME: Person_1
Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've
been here twelve all...

NAME: Person_1
Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do
it) ... to say good night. Okay?

NAME: Person_1
Spineless.

NAME: Person_1
Bean can I ask you something?

NAME: Person_1
Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've
known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?

NAME: Person_1
I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame.
She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the
flesh?

NAME: Person_1
I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but'
let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great
works of art is true, huh?

NAME: Person_1
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody
gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?

NAME: Side_2
Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like
my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with
her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.

NAME: Person_1
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me
David?

NAME: Side_2
Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm
calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're
my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.

NAME: Person_1
You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that
works the night shift.

NAME: Person_1
Stay there.    Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.

NAME: Person_1
Right.   Open now.

NAME: Person_1
I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want
to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave
the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.

NAME: Person_6
What the ... !!!

NAME: Side_21
Second floor.

NAME: Side_33
I guess I'll see you up there, guys.

NAME: Side_21
Third floor.

NAME: Person_4
I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project
today.

NAME: Person_1
Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy,
you know?

NAME: Person_4
Howls he getting on with the family?

NAME: Person_1
Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great.

NAME: Person_4
And howls Alison?

NAME: Person_1
She's ... well, she's good.

NAME: Person_4
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.
Nice guy. Good looking.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, isn't he.

NAME: Person_1
Isn't it?

NAME: Person_4
I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even
though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
way, huh?

NAME: Person_1
Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -
always a subtle joy.

NAME: Person_4
Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.

NAME: Person_4
By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the
balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or
we're all in the
crap house. What     do you think?

'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll
hear soon enough.

NAME: Person_7
True love can be very hard.

NAME: Person_1
gone?

NAME: Person_6
Ahm.....

NAME: Person_1
What?    What?

NAME: Person_1
Oh Jesus. Oh God.     Oh Jesus God.   Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh
Jesus of Nazareth.

NAME: Person_6
oh dear.

NAME: Person_1
What happened?!!!

NAME: Person_6
Ahm.... (setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive
answer).

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_1
Brilliant.   Brilliant. Problem solved!

NAME: Person_2
Ah, David.   Showing Dr. Bean our good lady?

NAME: Person_6
Actually I'm not a...

NAME: Person_1
That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his
father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying
doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes.

NAME: Person_2
Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself...

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Person_2
Er ... pray tell me why?

NAME: Side_2
Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why.

NAME: Side_2
I better continue my rounds, sir..

NAME: Person_1
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very
thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel
the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.

NAME: Person_2
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?

NAME: Person_1
Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she,
Bean?

NAME: Person_6
Oh yes.

NAME: Person_1
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of
paints ....

NAME: Person_2
Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth

NAME: Person_1
... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In
fact I'll go right now.

NAME: Person_2
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've
decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

NAME: Person_2
Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current
Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to
inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think
decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo.

NAME: Person_1
Bean.   Do you drink?

NAME: Person_1
Neither do I.

NAME: Person_1
It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -
lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?

NAME: Person_1
I guess not.

NAME: Person_1
He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?

NAME: Person_1
... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an
artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a
figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the
problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before
I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.

NAME: Person_1
Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.
Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.
Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I
should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I
tell you something, Beanie ...

NAME: Person_1
Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?

NAME: Person_1
So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you
understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been
better if I'd never been born.

NAME: Side_34
Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut.

NAME: Person_1
0 my God. Tell it vas a dream.

NAME: Person_6
Morning.

NAME: Person_1
It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them
Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever
looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.

NAME: Person_1
Ahm....

NAME: Person_2
Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want
anything to go wrong.

NAME: Person_1
Quite right, sir.

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute.

NAME: Person_6
Ssshhhh.

NAME: Person_8
Bye, Dad.

NAME: Person_1
Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen?

NAME: Person_8
Be serious, Dad.    It's Saturday.

NAME: Person_1
Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and
with your mom away ... I really need you.

NAME: Side_18
You.

NAME: Person_8
Don't worry, Dad.    I'll be home. Monday, after school.

NAME: Person_5
Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna
look just like its handsome driver.

NAME: Person_1
Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this
family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!
Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.

NAME: Person_8
And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a
family till you get Mom back.

NAME: Person_8
Come on Sting!

NAME: Person_5
Sting?!   Sounds like something you put on a rash.

NAME: Person_1
Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.

NAME: Person_1
To Person_6 )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!
the car!     Both of you. Jesus!

NAME: Person_7
So, Kevin.    How's it going?

NAME: Person_5
Badly.    You wanna adopt me?

NAME: Person_7
Big day today, huh?

NAME: Person_1
Uh ... yes ...

NAME: Person_4
Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and
concentrating on the future.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we
haven't been doing as badly as all that.

NAME: Person_1
Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after
Bean.

NAME: Person_5
My Dad told me all about you.

NAME: Person_7
Did he now?

NAME: Person_5
He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain
cell count of about two and a half.

NAME: Person_7
Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually.

NAME: Person_5
must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't
do anything.

NAME: Person_2
Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David?

NAME: Person_1
Certainly is.

NAME: Person_4
We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to
every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the
Governor.

NAME: Person_2
Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a
winning team.

NAME: Person_5
This is way cool, Beanie.

NAME: Person_4
Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who
actually gets things done.

NAME: Person_1
You arrange those flowers yourself?

NAME: Side_2
Sure did.

NAME: Person_1
They're pretty.   Learn it in the army?

NAME: Side_2
No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands,
you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

NAME: Person_2
What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of

NAME: Person_4
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.

NAME: Person_2
Right.    Got it.

NAME: Person_7
Good day, Governor Reynolds. I'm Annie ...

NAME: Person_4
Curtsy.

NAME: Person_7
Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1Side_26Side_260s America.      Women don't
curtsy, they run the damn country!

NAME: Person_2
Alex, please!

NAME: Person_7
That's Annie, sir.

NAME: Person_2
This is Elmer, our longest serving...

NAME: Person_4
Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans'
reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him
of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.

NAME: Person_1
David Leary. I'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and
thank you for your patronage ...

NAME: Person_4
Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour.       We have
to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!

NAME: Person_2
Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a
little smartening up to do myself.

NAME: Person_5
I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,

NAME: Side_35
NAME: Side_36
A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" Person_6 tries something 0 else.
The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making
Person_6 jump! It's Person_4. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.

NAME: Person_4
How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?

NAME: Person_4
We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more.
Period. Oh, And put this on.

NAME: Person_4
David?   Lift off!

NAME: Person_2
what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.

NAME: Side_1
Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s
reunion after.

NAME: Person_2
Not at all, Governor.    Very striking.

NAME: Side_1
Interesting suit.

NAME: Person_2
Why thank you sir.

NAME: Side_1
off the peg?

NAME: Person_2
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

NAME: Side_1
Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.

NAME: Person_4
Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.

NAME: Person_7
Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller
than you were half an hour ago.

NAME: Side_1
Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much.

NAME: Person_7
Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does
she 0 have a decent job?

NAME: Side_1
Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine.

NAME: Side_1
Nice set of medals there Elmer.      Which beach they drop you on?
Utah? Omaha?

NAME: Side_2
Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I
didn't know where I was.

NAME: Side_1
Well, congratulations soldier.

NAME: Person_2
Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the
established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?

NAME: Side_1
Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you
got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?

NAME: Person_4
Everything okay, David?

NAME: Person_1
Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had
got to.

NAME: Person_4
He's just parking the Governor's car.

NAME: Person_1
Great - keep him out of trouble.

NAME: Side_1
Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now?      My eyes are making my feet
sore, as my wife would say.

NAME: Person_1
Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way.

NAME: Person_1
Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother
before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with
his new friend.

NAME: Side_1
Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to
me - or should I say ten million dollars!

NAME: Person_2
Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it

NAME: Person_1
Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
England.

NAME: Person_6
Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...

NAME: Side_1
You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten
million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!?

NAME: Person_2
Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks

NAME: Person_1
Nice try, kiddo.

NAME: Person_7
David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife.

NAME: Person_1
Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a
date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.

NAME: Person_7
She's calling from the hospital ...

NAME: Person_7
She's on line three!

NAME: Person_7
Such... great buns.

NAME: Side_1
I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more
intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect
your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even
know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who
sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you
guys.

NAME: Person_2
I am sorry you feel that way.

NAME: Side_1
And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.     That suit stinks and
you obviously dye your hair.

NAME: Person_4
Certainly, sir.

NAME: Side_3
Come on man!     Move it!

NAME: Side_2
Hey, Cop, wanna ride?       Jeese, where do they get you guys?

NAME: Person_4
There is one other tiny problem, sir.

NAME: Person_5
Is Jenny gonna be okay?

NAME: Person_1
She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

NAME: Person_5
But is she gonna be okay?

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_1
Damn! She's a good kid. Sometimes good people get a break once

NAME: Side_2
It's okay!    I'll tail 'em!

NAME: Side_3
You got it.

NAME: Person_1
Just stay away from me!   D'you hear?

NAME: Side_1
Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way
of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass.

NAME: Person_3
They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just
a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while.

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me.

NAME: Side_10 1
I'll be back in a minute.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, great.

NAME: Person_3
At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.

NAME: Person_1
Ah, well ....

NAME: Side_Side_26
Doctor Jacobson?

NAME: Side_10 JACOBSON
Yes?

NAME: Side_Side_26
We need you urgently in C Theatre.

NAME: Side_10 JACOBSON
Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 ....

NAME: Side_Side_26
It is urgent, sir.

NAME: Side_10 JACOBSON
Okay.....

NAME: Side_2
No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now.

NAME: Side_2
Buck?

NAME: Side_Side_26 2
Doctor ... Bean?

NAME: Person_6
NAME: Side_Side_26 2
Just in time, sir.     Allow me.

NAME: Person_3
When the Police told me what had happened I ... it's stupid I know
... but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to
coma victims ...

NAME: Person_5
Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee
grinders?

NAME: Person_3
That right.   So I went home and picked it up.

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_4
Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the
lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's
severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.

NAME: Side_Side_26 2
He's coming round.

NAME: Side_4
Give him a T 70, straight away.

NAME: Side_4
Shall I do the cut, sir?

NAME: Side_4
I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

NAME: Side_Side_26
I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll
never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
systems.

NAME: Side_4
so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all
better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.

NAME: Side_38
Any news on the chief?.

NAME: Side_4
There certainly is.    Dr Bean here just saved his life.

NAME: Person_3
0 my god.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

NAME: Person_3
Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me.

NAME: Side_10 2
Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to
deal with here, sir.

NAME: Person_3
Excuse me, doctor.

NAME: Side_10
Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.

NAME: Person_3
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Say that again, son.

NAME: Side_10
I beg your pardon?

NAME: Person_1
I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll
make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less
healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.

NAME: Side_10
I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

NAME: Person_1
We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the
Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end
of the world.

NAME: Person_1
and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going
to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence
and    attention you    are    going to give her case.

NAME: Side_10
Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will
you?

NAME: Person_3
Smiling         Well, well.

NAME: Person_3
Let's get a coffee.

NAME: Person_1
Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.

NAME: Person_5
Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna
wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire
bats.

NAME: Person_3
Disgusting.

NAME: Person_1
Everything's gonna be fine.

NAME: Person_3
About Charles...

NAME: Person_1
shhh...

NAME: Person_3
It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was
the last time we laughed? Any of us?

NAME: Person_1
I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular
proportions. Olympic standard.

NAME: Person_5
Dad...

NAME: Person_5
These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ...

NAME: Side_40
Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down
the hall that could use ...

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_3
in you, my' man?

NAME: Person_3
Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.

NAME: Person_1
Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

NAME: Person_1
I thought you said....

NAME: Person_1
Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you
hear me? Come on now...

NAME: Person_8
Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom?

NAME: Person_5
I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back
from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do
not lie!

NAME: Person_1
Here, let me do that.

NAME: Person_3
No, I'm fine.

NAME: Person_6
NAME: Person_3
Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready.

NAME: Person_3
There.     Is that how you like them?

NAME: Person_3
He's not too bad.       I can live with him.

NAME: Person_1
I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale
to tell. And not a happy one.

NAME: Person_2
Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday
teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would
have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent
philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself
for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell
her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership
flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
President.

NAME: Person_2
He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and
the 21st century.

NAME: Person_4
Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we
can ...

NAME: Person_2
Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?
Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we
find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a
criminal of great genius.

NAME: Person_2
Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!

NAME: Person_2
The best security in the world is no match for a master
criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank
you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new
Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the
computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were
so rudely interrupted by events.

NAME: Person_2
David, David, David ...

NAME: Person_1
I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?

NAME: Person_2
Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,
relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,
through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I
trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

NAME: Person_2
I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie
will.

NAME: Person_2
Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation
for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
bathroom.

NAME: Person_2
How are you making out there?

NAME: Person_4
All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be
quite a show.

NAME: Person_4
Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother.

NAME: Person_4
Just click on the corner.

NAME: Person_4
Right let me take over now...

NAME: Person_4
You've had long enough on it now.       A joke's a joke.   That's it.
Period!

NAME: Person_4
You can stop right there, Mr! Those are confidential ...

NAME: Person_6
Daaa!   Daaa!

NAME: Person_4
Excuse me, If I may just ...

NAME: Person_2
Shut up, Schimmel. Exactly how long have you been siphoning
gallery money into your own private accounts?

NAME: Person_1
Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all
completely fictional ... back as far as June Side_263 ...

NAME: Person_4
I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

NAME: Person_2
Horse shit.   You're dead, grease-ball.   Period.

NAME: Person_4
But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn
you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably
typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit
There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me
up!

NAME: Person_2
Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that?

NAME: Person_6
NAME: Person_2
I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd

NAME: Side_41
Oh, yeah - I forgot.

NAME: Person_2
I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
you do not.

NAME: Person_1
VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

NAME: Person_2
Of course.

NAME: Person_1
And a car.

NAME: Person_2
Mmmmm...

NAME: Person_1
Maybe two cars.

NAME: Person_2
A car sounds sensible.

NAME: Person_1
And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.
Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
time to make up.

NAME: Person_3
well, it's been... unusual. But thank you.

NAME: Person_8
Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time.

NAME: Person_1
Come on          hurry or we'll be late.

NAME: Person_1
... Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National. Said
good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,
huh?

NAME: Person_5
Good-bye Beanie. It's Bean .... surreal.          And don't forget you're
welcome to come back anytime ...

NAME: Person_5
... in the distant future.

NAME: Person_1
Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?      I know
it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

NAME: Side_42
They've moved, guy.

Is he gone?

NAME: Side_7
Yes, my lord.

NAME: Person_7-OVER
A way out west there was a fella,
fella I want to tell you about, fella
by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At
least, that was the handle his lovin'
parents gave him, but he never had
much use for it himself.  This
Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.
Now, Dude, that's a name no one would
self-apply where I come from.  But
then, there was a lot about the Dude
that didn't make a whole lot of sense
to me.  And a lot about where he
lived, like- wise.  But then again,
maybe that's why I found the place
s'durned innarestin'.

NAME: Person_7-OVER
They call Los Angeles the City of
Angels.  I didn't find it to be that
exactly, but I'll allow as there are
some nice folks there.  'Course, I
can't say I seen London, and I never
been to France, and I ain't never
seen no queen in her damn undies as
the fella says.  But I'll tell you
what, after seeing Los Angeles and
thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever'
bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any
a those other places, and in English
too, so I can die with a smile on my
face without feelin' like the good
Lord gypped me.

NAME: Person_7-OVER
Now this story I'm about to unfold
took place back in the early nineties--
just about the time of our conflict
with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I
only mention it 'cause some- times
there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro,
'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes
there's a man.

NAME: Person_7-OVER
And I'm talkin' about the Dude here--
sometimes there's a man who, wal,
he's the man for his time'n place,
he fits right in there--and that's
the Dude, in Los Angeles.

NAME: Side_33
This aggression will not stand. . .
This will not stand!

NAME: Person_7-OVER
...and even if he's a lazy man, and
the Dude was certainly that--quite
possibly the laziest in Los Angeles
County.

NAME: Person_7-OVER
...which would place him high in the
runnin' for laziest worldwide--but
sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes
there's a man.

NAME: Person_7-OVER
Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.
But--aw hell, I done innerduced him
enough.

NAME: Person_1
It's the LeBaron.

NAME: Person_7
We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny
said you were good for it.

NAME: Person_7
Where's the money, Lebowski!

NAME: Person_7
Where's the money, Lebowski!

NAME: Person_1
It's uh, it's down there somewhere.
Lemme take another look.

NAME: Person_7
Don't fuck with us.  If your wife
owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that
means you owe money to Jackie
Treehorn.

NAME: CHINESE Side_7
Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, man.  Don't do--

NAME: Side_4
You see what happens?  You see what
happens, Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You
got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude,
man.

NAME: Side_4
Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is
Bunny.

NAME: Person_1
Bunny?  Look, moron.

NAME: Person_1
You see a wedding ring?  Does this
place look like I'm fucking married?
All my plants are dead!

NAME: Side_4
The fuck is this?

NAME: Person_1
Obviously you're not a golfer.

NAME: Side_4
Woo?

NAME: Side_9
Yeah?

NAME: Side_4
Wasn't this guy supposed to be a
millionaire?

NAME: Side_9
Uh?

NAME: Side_9
Fuck.

NAME: Side_4
What do you think?

NAME: Side_9
He looks like a fuckin' loser.

NAME: Person_1
Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

NAME: Side_9
Fuckin' waste of time.

NAME: Side_4
Thanks a lot, asshole.

NAME: Side_7
Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.
Mark it, Dude.

NAME: Person_2
This was a valued rug.

NAME: Person_2
This was, uh--

NAME: Person_1
Yeah man, it really tied the room
together--

NAME: Person_2
This was a valued, uh.

NAME: Person_5
What tied the room together, Dude?

NAME: Person_2
Were you listening to the story,
Donny?

NAME: Person_5
What--

NAME: Person_2
Were you listening to the Dude's
story?

NAME: Person_5
I was bowling--

NAME: Person_2
So you have no frame of reference,
Donny.  You're like a child who
wanders in in the middle of a movie
and wants to know--

NAME: Person_1
What's your point, Walter?

NAME: Person_2
There's no fucking reason--here's my
point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

NAME: Person_5
Yeah Walter, what's your point?

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
What's the point of--we all know who
was at fault, so what the fuck are
you talking about?

NAME: Person_2
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you
talking--I'm not--we're talking about
unchecked aggression here--

NAME: Person_5
What the fuck is he talking about?

NAME: Person_1
My rug.

NAME: Person_2
Forget it, Donny.  You're out of
your element.

NAME: Person_1
This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I
can't go give him a bill so what the
fuck are you talking about?

NAME: Person_2
What the fuck are you talking about?!
This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm
talking about drawing a line in the
sand, Dude.  Across this line you do
not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is
not the preferred, uh. . . Asian-
American.  Please.

NAME: Person_1
Walter, this is not a guy who built
the rail- roads, here, this is a guy
who peed on my--

NAME: Person_2
What the fuck are you--

NAME: Person_1
Walter, he peed on my rug--

NAME: Person_5
He peed on the Dude's rug--

NAME: Person_2
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This
Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
So who--

NAME: Person_2
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other
Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.
He's gonna be easier to find anyway
than these two, uh. these two  . . .
And he has the wealth, uh, the
resources obviously, and there is no
reason, no FUCKING reason, why his
wife should go out and owe money and
they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

NAME: Person_1
No, but--

NAME: Person_2
Am I wrong!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, but--

NAME: Person_2
Okay. That, uh.

NAME: Person_1
Fuckin' A.

NAME: Person_5
And this guy peed on it.

NAME: Person_2
Donny!  Please!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

NAME: Person_5
His name is Lebowski?  That's your
name, Dude!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should
compensate me for the fucking rug.
I mean his wife goes out and owes
money and they pee on my rug.

NAME: Person_2
Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on
your fucking Rug.

NAME: Person_8
And this is the study.  You can see
the various commendations, honorary
degrees, et cetera.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, uh, very impressive.

NAME: Person_8
Please, feel free to inspect them.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not really, uh.

NAME: Person_8
Please!  Please!

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_8
That's the key to the city of
Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was
given two years ago in recognition
of his various civic, uh.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_8
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce Business Achiever award,
which is given--not necessarily given
every year!  Given only when there's
a worthy, somebody especially--

NAME: Person_1
Hey, is this him with Nancy?

NAME: Person_8
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the
first lady, yes, taken when--

NAME: Person_1
Lebowski on the right?

NAME: Person_8
Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right,
Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

NAME: Person_1
He's handicapped, huh?

NAME: Person_8
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And
this picture was taken when Mrs.
Reagan was first lady of the nation,
yes, yes? Not of California.

NAME: Person_1
Far out.

NAME: Person_8
And in fact he met privately with
the President, though unfortunately
there wasn't time for a photo
opportunity.

NAME: Person_1
Nancy's pretty good.

NAME: Person_8
Wonderful woman.  We were very--

NAME: Person_1
Are these.

NAME: Person_8
These are Mr. Lebowski's children,
so to speak--

NAME: Person_1
Different mothers, huh?

NAME: Person_8
No, they--

NAME: Person_1
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially
pretty cool--

NAME: Person_8
They're not his, heh-heh, they're
not literally his children; they're
the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
inner-city children of promise but
without the--

NAME: Person_1
I see.

NAME: Person_8
--without  the means  for higher
education, so Mr. Lebowski  has
committed  to sending  all of them
to college.

NAME: Person_1
Jeez.  Think he's got room for one
more?

NAME: Person_8
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went
to college?

NAME: Person_1
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most
of my time occupying various, um,
administration buildings--

NAME: Person_8
Heh-heh--

NAME: Person_1
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into
the ROTC--

NAME: Person_8
Yes, heh--

NAME: Person_1
--and bowling.  I'll tell you the
truth, Brandt, I don't remember most
of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

NAME: Person_4
Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a
Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very
busy so what can I do for you?

NAME: Person_1
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really
tied the room together-

NAME: Person_4
You told Brandt on the phone, he
told me.  So where do I fit in?

NAME: Person_1
Well they were looking for you, these
two guys, they were trying to--

NAME: Person_4
I'll say it again, all right?  You
told Brandt.  He told me.  I know
what happened. Yes?  Yes?

NAME: Person_1
So you know they were trying to piss
on your rug--

NAME: Person_4
Did I urinate on your rug?

NAME: Person_1
You mean, did you personally come
and pee on my--

NAME: Person_4
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla
usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.
Did I urinate on your rug?

NAME: Person_1
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on
the rug--

NAME: Person_4
Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I
just want to understand this, sir--
every time a rug is micturated upon
in this fair city, I have to
compensate the--

NAME: Person_1
Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam
anybody here, I'm just--

NAME: Person_4
You're just looking for a handout
like every other--are you employed,
Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
Look, let me explain something.
I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr.
Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's
what  you  call me.  That, or Duder.
His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,
you know, you're not into the whole
brevity thing--

NAME: Person_4
Are you employed, sir?

NAME: Person_1
Employed?

NAME: Person_4
You don't go out and make a living
dressed like that in the middle of a
weekday.

NAME: Person_1
Is this a--what day is this?

NAME: Person_4
But I do work, so if you don't mind--

NAME: Person_1
No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.
This will not stand, ya know, this
will not stand, man.  I mean, if
your wife owes--

NAME: Person_4
My wife is not the issue here. I
hope that my wife will someday learn
to live on her allowance, which is
ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that
will be her problem, not mine, just
as your rug is your problem, just as
every bum's lot in life is his own
responsibility regardless of whom he
chooses to blame.  I didn't blame
anyone for the loss of my legs, some
chinaman in Korea took them from me
but I went out and achieved anyway.
I can't solve your problems, sir,
only you can.

NAME: Person_1
Ah fuck it.

NAME: Person_4
Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!
Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your
answer to everything!

NAME: Person_4
Your "revolution" is over, Mr.
Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums
lost!

NAME: Person_4
...My advice is, do what your parents
did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will
always lose-- do you hear me,
Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

NAME: Side_35
--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt
is approaching.

NAME: Person_6
How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
Okay.  The old man told me to take
any rug in the house.

NAME: Person_6
Manolo will load it into your car
for you, uh, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
It's the LeBaron.

NAME: Person_6
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see
you again some time, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the
neighborhood, need to use the john.

NAME: YOUNG WOSide_7
Blow on them.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: YOUNG WOSide_7
G'ahead.  Blow.

NAME: Person_1
You want me to blow on your toes?

NAME: YOUNG WOSide_7
Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

NAME: Person_1
You sure he won't mind?

NAME: YOUNG WOSide_7
Dieter doesn't care about anything.
He's a nihilist.

NAME: Person_1
Practicing?

NAME: YOUNG WOSide_7
You're not blowing.

NAME: Person_6
Our guest has to be getting along,
Mrs.  Lebowski.

NAME: Person_1
You're Bunny?

NAME: Side_25
I'll suck your cock for a thousand
dollars.

NAME: Person_6
Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very
free-spirited.  We're all very fond
of her.

NAME: Side_25
Brandt can't watch though.  Or he
has to pay a hundred.

NAME: Person_6
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

NAME: Person_1
I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

NAME: Person_5
Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in
the water!!

NAME: Person_1
Your maples, Carl.

NAME: Person_2
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it
is no dream.

NAME: Person_1
You're fucking twenty minutes late.
What the fuck is that?

NAME: Person_2
Theodore Herzel.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_2
State of Israel.  If you will it,
Dude, it is no--

NAME: Person_1
What the fuck're you talking about?
The carrier.  What's in the fucking
carrier?

NAME: Person_2
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.
Can't leave him home alone or he
eats the furniture.

NAME: Person_1
What the fuck are you--

NAME: Person_2
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.
I'm looking after it while Cynthia
and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

NAME: Person_1
You brought a fucking Pomeranian
bowling?

NAME: Person_2
What do you mean "brought it bowling"?
I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not
buying it a fucking beer.  He's not
gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked
me to take care of her fucking dog
while she and her boyfriend went to
Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck
herself.  Why can't she board it?

NAME: Person_2
First of all, Dude, you don't have
an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show
dog with fucking papers.  You can't
board it.  It gets upset, its hair
falls out.

NAME: Person_1
Hey man--

NAME: Person_2
Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over
the line!

NAME: Person_2
Smokey Huh?

NAME: Person_2
Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.
That's a foul.

NAME: Side_5
Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

NAME: Side_5
Bullshit. Walter!

NAME: Person_2
This is not Nam.  This is bowling.
There are rules.

NAME: Person_1
Come on Walter, it's just--it's
Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a
little, it's just a game.

NAME: Person_2
This is a league game.  This
determines who enters the next round-
robin, am I wrong?

NAME: Side_5
Yeah, but--

NAME: Person_2
Am I wrong!?

NAME: Side_5
Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the
marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an
eight.

NAME: Person_2
Smokey my friend, you're entering a
world of pain.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Walter--

NAME: Person_2
Mark that frame an eight, you're
entering a world of pain.

NAME: Side_5
I'm not--

NAME: Person_2
A world of pain.

NAME: Side_5
Look Dude, I don't hold with this.
This guy is your partner, you should--

NAME: Person_1
Walter, they're calling the cops,
put the piece away.

NAME: Side_5
Walter--

NAME: Side_5
All right!  There it is!  It's fucking
zero!

NAME: Side_5
You happy, you crazy fuck?

NAME: Person_2
This is a league game, Smokey!

NAME: Person_1
Walter, you can't do that.  These
guys're like me, they're pacificists.
Smokey was a conscientious objector.

NAME: Person_2
You know Dude, I myself dabbled with
pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam,
of course--

NAME: Person_1
And you know Smokey has emotional
problems!

NAME: Person_2
You mean--beyond pacifism?

NAME: Person_1
He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

NAME: Person_2
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well,
it's water under the bridge.  And we
do enter the next round-robin, am I
wrong?

NAME: Person_1
No, you're not wrong--

NAME: Person_2
Am I wrong!

NAME: Person_1
You're not wrong, Walter, you're
just an asshole.

NAME: Person_2
Okay then.  We play Quintana and
O'Brien next week.  They'll be
pushovers.

NAME: Person_1
Just, just take it easy, Walter.

NAME: Person_2
That's your answer to everything,
Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism
is not--look at our current situation
with that camelfucker in Iraq--
pacifism is not something to hide
behind.

NAME: Person_1
Well, just take 't easy, man.

NAME: Person_2
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

NAME: Person_2
Calmer than you are.

NAME: Person_1
Just take it easy, man!

NAME: Person_2
Calmer than you are.

NAME: Person_7
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't
wanna be a hard-on about this, and I
know it wasn't your fault, but I
just thought it was fair to tell you
that Gene and I will be submitting
this to the League and asking them
to set aside the round.  Or maybe
forfeit it to us--

NAME: Person_1
Shit!

NAME: Person_7
--so, like I say, just thought, you
know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

NAME: ANOTHER Person_7
Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh,
well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.
Please call us as soon as is
convenient.

NAME: ANOTHER Person_7
Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski
with the Southern Cal Bowling League.
I just got a, an informal report,
uh, that a uh, a member of your team,
uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded
weapon during league play--

NAME: Person_1
Hiya Allan.

NAME: Side_19
Dude, I finally got the venue I
wanted.  I'm Performing my dance
quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane
Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on
Tuesday night, and I'd love it if
you came and gave me notes.

NAME: Person_1
Sure Allan, I'll be there.

NAME: Side_19
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the
tenth.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

NAME: Side_19
Just, uh, just slip the rent under
my door.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, okay.

NAME: Person_7
--serious infraction, and examine
your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

NAME: Person_7
Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please
do call us when you get in and I'll
send the limo.  Let me assure you--I
hope you're not avoiding this call
because of the rug, which, I assure
you, is not a problem.  We need your
help and, uh--well we would very
much like to see you.  Thank you.
It's Brandt.

NAME: Person_6
We've had some terrible news.  Mr.
Lebowski is in seclusion in the West
Wing.

NAME: Person_1
Huh.

NAME: Person_6
Mr. Lebowski.

NAME: Person_4
It's funny.  I can look back on a
life of achievement, on challenges
met, competitors bested, obstacles
overcome.  I've accomplished more
than most men, and without the use
of my legs.  What. . . What makes a
man, Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
Dude.

NAME: Person_4
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know, sir.

NAME: Person_4
Is it. . . is it, being prepared to
do the right thing?  Whatever the
price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

NAME: Person_1
Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

NAME: Person_4
You're joking.  But perhaps you're
right.

NAME: Person_1
Mind if I smoke a jay?

NAME: Person_4
Bunny.

NAME: Person_1
'Scuse me?

NAME: Person_4
Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light
of my life.  Are you surprised at my
tears, sir?

NAME: Person_1
Fuckin' A.

NAME: Person_4
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men
also cry.

NAME: Person_4
I received this fax this morning.

NAME: Person_4
As you can see, it is a ransom note.
Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable
to achieve on a level field of play.
Men who will not sign their names.
Weaklings.  Bums.

NAME: Person_1
Bummer.

NAME: Person_4
Brandt will fill you in on the
details.

NAME: Person_6
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a
generous offer to you to act as
courier once we get instructions for
the money.

NAME: Person_1
Why me, man?

NAME: Person_6
He suspects that the culprits might
be the very people who, uh, soiled
your rug, and you're in a unique
position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm
that suspicion.

NAME: Person_1
So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers,
huh?

NAME: Person_6
Well Dude, we just don't know.

NAME: Person_1
Fucking Quintana--that creep can
roll, man--

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert,
Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_2
The man is a sex offender.  With a
record.  Spent six months in Chino
for exposing himself to an eight-
year-old.

NAME: Person_1
Huh.

NAME: Person_2
When he moved down to Venice he had
to go door-to-door to tell everyone
he's a pederast.

NAME: Person_5
What's a pederast, Walter?

NAME: Person_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.

NAME: Person_2
Anyway.  How much they offer you?

NAME: Person_1
Twenty grand.  And of course I still
keep the rug.

NAME: Person_2
Just for making the hand-off?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so
whenever these guys call--

NAME: Person_2
What if it's during a game?

NAME: Person_1
I told him if it was during league
play--

NAME: Person_5
If what's during league play?

NAME: Person_2
Life does not stop and start at your
convenience, you miserable piece of
shit.

NAME: Person_5
What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
I figure it's easy money, it's all
pretty harmless.  I mean she probably
kidnapped herself.

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_5
What do you mean, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean
look at it.  Young trophy wife.
Marries a guy for money but figures
he isn't giving her enough.  She
owes money all over town--

NAME: Person_2
That...fucking...bitch!

NAME: Person_1
It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin
said, look for the person who will
benefit.  And you will, uh, you know,
you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying
to say--

NAME: Person_5
I am the Walrus.

NAME: Person_2
That fucking bitch!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_5
I am the Walrus.

NAME: Person_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!
Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

NAME: Person_5
What the fuck is he talking about?

NAME: Person_2
That's fucking exactly what happened,
Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

NAME: Person_5
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed
off?

NAME: Person_2
Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking
thing-- I did not watch my buddies
die face down in the muck so that
this fucking strumpet--

NAME: Person_1
I don't see any connection to Vietnam,
Walter.

NAME: Person_2
Well, there isn't a literal
connection, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Walter, face it, there isn't any
connection.  It's your roll.

NAME: Person_2
Have it your way.  The point is--

NAME: Person_1
It's your roll--

NAME: Person_2
The fucking point is--

NAME: Person_1
It's your roll.

NAME: Person_7
Are you ready to be fucked, man?

NAME: Side_12
I see you rolled your way into the
semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and
me, we're gonna fuck you up.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah well, that's just, ya know,
like, your opinion, man.

NAME: Side_12
Let me tell you something, bendeco.
You pull any your crazy shit with
us, you flash a piece out on the
lanes, I'll take it away from you
and stick it up your ass and pull
the fucking trigger til it goes
"click".

NAME: Person_1
Jesus.

NAME: Side_12
You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with
the Jesus.

NAME: Person_2
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Oh man.

NAME: Person_6
They called about eighty minutes
ago.  They want you to take the money
and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll
call you on the portable phone with
instructions in about forty minutes.
One person only or I'd go with you.
They were very clear on that: one
person only.  What happened to your
jaw?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, nothin', you know.

NAME: Person_6
Here's the money, and the phone.
Please, Dude, follow whatever
instructions they give.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_6
Her life is in your hands.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, man, don't say that..

NAME: Person_6
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:
Her life is in your hands.

NAME: Person_1
Shit.

NAME: Person_6
Her life is in your hands, Dude.
And report back to us as soon as
it's done.

NAME: Person_2
Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

NAME: Person_1
The what?

NAME: Person_2
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have
they called yet?

NAME: Person_1
What the hell is this?

NAME: Person_2
My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.
The whites.

NAME: Person_1
Agh--

NAME: Person_1
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason
you brought your dirty undies--

NAME: Person_2
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.
The ringer can't look empty.

NAME: Person_1
Walter--what the fuck are you
thinking?

NAME: Person_2
Well you're right, Dude, I got to
thinking.  I got to thinking why
should we settle for a measly fucking
twenty grand--

NAME: Person_1
We?  What the fuck we?  You said you
just wanted to come along--

NAME: Person_2
My point, Dude, is why should we
settle for twenty grand when we can
keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

NAME: Person_1
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a
fucking game, Walter--

NAME: Person_2
It is a fucking game.  You said so
yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

NAME: Person_1 '
Yeah, but--

NAME: Person_1
Dude here.

NAME: Person_7
Who is this?

NAME: Person_1
Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want
us to go?

NAME: Person_7
...Us?

NAME: Person_7
Shut the fuck up.
Hello?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah?

NAME: Person_7
Okay, listen--

NAME: Person_2
Dude, are you fucking this up?

NAME: Person_7
Who is that?

NAME: Person_1
The driver man, I told you--

NAME: Person_1
Oh shit.  Walter.

NAME: Person_2
What the fuck is going on there?

NAME: Person_1
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it
up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was
in our hands!

NAME: Person_2
Easy, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
We're screwed now!  We don't get
shit and they're gonna kill her!
We're fucked, Walter!

NAME: Person_2
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.
You're being very unDude.  They'll
call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

NAME: Person_2
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here,
Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These
guys are fucking amateurs--

NAME: Person_1
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say
peep when I'm doing business here.

NAME: Person_2
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

NAME: Person_2
But they're amateurs.

NAME: Person_1
Dude here.

NAME: Person_7
Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there
is no funny stuff.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_7
So no funny stuff.  Okay?

NAME: Person_1
Hey, just tell me where the fuck you
want us to go.

NAME: Person_1
That was the sign.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back,
nobody's in a position to complain.
And we keep the baksheesh.

NAME: Person_1
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't
told me how we get her back.  Where
is she?

NAME: Person_2
That's the simple part, Dude.  When
we make the handoff, I grab the guy
and beat  it out of him.

NAME: Person_2
...Huh?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.
That's fucking ingenious, if I
understand it correctly.  That's a
Swiss fucking watch.

NAME: Person_2
Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of
this is its simplicity. If the plan
gets too complex something always
goes wrong.  If there's one thing I
learned in Nam--

NAME: Person_1
Dude.

NAME: Person_7
You are approaching a vooden britch.
When you cross it you srow ze bag
from ze left vindow of ze moving
kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch
you.

NAME: Person_2
What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
off?

NAME: Person_1
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!
At a wooden bridge we throw the money
out  of the car!

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
We throw the money out of the moving
car!

NAME: Person_2
We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks
up our plan.

NAME: Person_1
Well call them up and explain it to
'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking
simple, I'm sure they'd fucking
understand it!  That's the beauty of
it Walter!

NAME: Person_2
Wooden bridge, huh?

NAME: Person_1
I'm throwing the money, Walter!
We're not fucking around!

NAME: Person_2
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the
ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

NAME: Person_1
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but
sooner or later you're gonna have to
face the fact that you're a goddamn
moron.

NAME: Person_2
Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's
the bridge--

NAME: Person_1
Walter!

NAME: Person_2
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

NAME: Person_1
What the fuck?

NAME: Person_2
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch
I roll out!  I double back, grab one
of 'em and beat it out of him!  The
uzi!

NAME: Person_1
Uzi?

NAME: Person_2
You didn't think I was rolling out
of here naked!

NAME: Person_1
Walter, please--

NAME: Person_2
Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's
take that hill!

NAME: Person_1
WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

NAME: Person_2
Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

NAME: Person_2
Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used
to say.

NAME: Person_1
What the fuck is that supposed to
mean?  What the fuck're we gonna
tell Lebowski?

NAME: Person_2
Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't
see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?  The problem is--what do you
mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
they're gonna kill that poor woman--

NAME: Person_2
What the fuck're you talking about?
That poor woman--that poor slut--
kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said
so yourself--

NAME: Person_1
No, Walter!  I said I thought she
kidnapped herself!  You're the one
who's so fucking certain--

NAME: Person_2
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

NAME: Person_5
They posted the next round of the
tournament--

NAME: Person_2
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

NAME: Person_5
This Saturday.  Quintana and--

NAME: Person_2
Saturday!  Well they'll have to
reschedule.

NAME: Person_1
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

NAME: Person_2
I told that fuck down at the league
office-- who's in charge of
scheduling?

NAME: Person_1
Walter--

NAME: Person_5
Burkhalter.

NAME: Person_2
I told that kraut a fucking thousand
times I don't roll on shabbas.

NAME: Person_5
It's already posted.

NAME: Person_1
Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about
that poor woman?  What do we tell--

NAME: Person_2
C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get
sick of her little game and, you
know, wander back--

NAME: Person_5
How come you don't roll on Saturday,
Walter?

NAME: Person_2
I'm shomer shabbas.

NAME: Person_5
What's that, Walter?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, and in the meantime what do I
tell Lebowski?

NAME: Person_2
Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of
rest.  Means I don't work, I don't
drive a car, I don't fucking ride in
a car, I don't handle money, I don't
turn on the oven, and I sure as shit
don't fucking roll!

NAME: Person_5
Sheesh.

NAME: Person_1
Walter, how--

NAME: Person_2
Shomer shabbas.

NAME: Person_1
That's it.  I'm out of here.

NAME: Person_2
For Christ's sake, Dude.

NAME: Person_5
Oh yeah, how'd it go?

NAME: Person_2
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little
dinged up--

NAME: Person_1
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking
hand- off!  They didn't get, the
fucking money and they're gonna--
they're gonna--

NAME: Person_2
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

NAME: Person_2
Kill that poor woman.

NAME: Person_5
Walter, if you can't ride in a car,
how d'you get around on Shammas--

NAME: Person_2
Really, Dude, you surprise me.
They're not gonna kill shit.  They're
not gonna do shit.  What can they
do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile,
look at the bottom line.  Who's
sitting on a million fucking dollars?
Am I wrong?

NAME: Person_1
Walter--

NAME: Person_2
Who's got a fucking million fucking
dollars parked in the trunk of our
car out here?

NAME: Person_1
"Our" car, Walter?

NAME: Person_2
And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty
undies.  My fucking whites--Say,
where is  the car?

NAME: Person_5
Who has your undies, Walter?

NAME: Person_2
Where's your car, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to
know the answer to everything else!

NAME: Person_2
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped
spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

NAME: Person_1
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking
know it's been stolen!

NAME: Person_2
Well, certainly that's a possibility,
Dude--

NAME: Person_1
Aw, fuck it.

NAME: Person_5
Where you going, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
I'm going home, Donny.

NAME: Person_5
Your phone's ringing, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you, Donny.

NAME: Person_1
1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

NAME: Side_10
Color?

NAME: Person_1
Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust,
coloration.

NAME: Side_10
And was there anything of value in
the car?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple
of Creedence tapes.  And there was
a, uh. . . my briefcase.

NAME: Side_10
In the briefcase?

NAME: Person_1
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my
papers.  Business papers.

NAME: Side_10
And what do you do, sir?

NAME: Person_1
I'm unemployed.

NAME: Side_20
...Most people, we're working nights,
they offer us coffee.

NAME: Person_1
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But
it's nice when they offer.

NAME: Person_1
...Also, my rug was stolen.

NAME: Side_10
Your rug was in the car.

NAME: Person_1
No.  Here.

NAME: Side_10
Separate incidents?

NAME: Side_20
Snap out of it, son.

NAME: Person_1
You find them much?  Stolen cars?

NAME: Side_10
Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much
hope for the tape deck though.  Or
the Creedence tapes.

NAME: Person_1
And the, uh, the briefcase?

NAME: FEMALE Person_7 ON MACHINE
Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.
Call when you get home and I'll send
a car for you.  My name is Maude
Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took
the rug.

NAME: Side_20
Well, I guess we can close the file
on that one.

NAME: Person_7
I'll be with you in a minute, Mr.
Lebowski.

NAME: Person_1
Is that what that's a picture of?

NAME: Person_3
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe.
My art has been commended as being
strongly vaginal.  Which bothers
some men.  The word itself makes
some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah?

NAME: Person_3
Yes, they don't like hearing it and
find it difficult to say.  Whereas
without batting an eye a man will
refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or
his "Johnson".

NAME: Person_1
"Johnson"?

NAME: Person_3
Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_3
Yes, I know about it.  And I know
that you acted as courier.  And let
me tell you something:  the whole
thing stinks to high heaven.

NAME: Person_1
Right, but let me explain something
about that rug--

NAME: Person_3
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me?

NAME: Person_3
Sex.  The physical act of love.
Coitus.  Do you like it?

NAME: Person_1
I was talking about my rug.

NAME: Person_3
You're not interested in sex?

NAME: Person_1
You mean coitus?

NAME: Person_3
I like it too.  It's a male myth
about feminists that we hate sex.
It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.
But unfortunately there are some
people--it is called satyriasis in
men, nymphomania in women--who engage
in it compulsively and without joy.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, no.

NAME: Person_3
Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate
souls cannot love in the true sense
of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance
Bunny is one of these.

NAME: Person_1
Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your
stepmother is a nympho, but I don't
see what it has to do with--do you
have any kalhua?

NAME: Person_3
Take a look at this, sir.

NAME: Side_3
Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere
iss problem mit deine kable.

NAME: Person_1
Shit, I know that guy.  He's a
nihilist.

NAME: Person_3
And you recognize her, of course.

NAME: Side_3
Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

NAME: Person_3
The story is ludicrous.

NAME: Side_3
Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to
verk in zese clozes--

NAME: Person_3
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes
from here.

NAME: Person_1
He fixes the cable?

NAME: Person_3
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little
matter to me that this woman chose
to pursue a career

NAME: Person_1
Shit yeah, the achievers.

NAME: Person_3
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,
yes, and proud we are of all of them.
I asked my father about his withdrawal
of a million dollars from the
Foundation account and he told me
about this "abduction", but I tell
you it is preposterous.  This
compulsive

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, but my-

NAME: Person_3
I'm getting to your rug. My  father
and I don't get along; he doesn't
approve of my lifestyle and, needless
to say, I don't approve of his.
Still, I hardly wish to make my
father's embezzlement a police matter,
so I'm proposing that you try to
recover the money from the people
you delivered it to.

NAME: Person_1
Well--sure, I could do that--

NAME: Person_3
If you successfully do so, I will
compensate you to the tune of 1% of
the recovered sum.

NAME: Person_1
A hundred.

NAME: Person_3
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or
whatever you call them.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, but what about--

NAME: Person_3
--your rug, yes, well with that money
you can buy any number of rugs that
don't have sentimental value for me.
And I am sorry about that crack on
the jaw.

NAME: Person_1
Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

NAME: Person_3
Here's the name and number of a doctor
who will look at it for you.  You
will receive no bill.  He's a good
man, and thorough.

NAME: Person_1
That's really thoughtful but I--

NAME: Person_3
Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a
good man, and thorough.

NAME: Side_15
--So he says, "My son can't hold a
job, my daughter's married to a
fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on
my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.
But you know me.  I can't complain."

NAME: Person_1
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.
Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya
Tony.

NAME: Side_27
Aw, forget about it.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be
worrying about that shit.  Life goes
on!

NAME: Side_27
Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your
friend in the Volkswagon?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
When did he-

NAME: Side_38
Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No
arguments.

NAME: Person_1
Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

NAME: Person_4
Start talking and talk fast you lousy
bum!

NAME: Person_6
We've been frantically trying to
reach you, Dude.

NAME: Person_4
Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

NAME: Person_1
Well we--I don't--

NAME: Person_4
They did not receive the money, you
nitwit!  They  did not receive the
goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR

NAME: Person_6
This is our concern, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
No, man, nothing is fucked here--

NAME: Person_1
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?
Those guys are--we dropped off the
damn money--

NAME: Person_1
I--the royal we, you know, the
editorial--I dropped off the money,
exactly as per--Look, I've got certain
information, certain things have
come to light, and uh, has it ever
occurred to you, man, that given the
nature of all this new shit, that,
uh, instead of running around blaming
me, that this whole thing might just
be, not, you know, not just such a
simple, but uh--you know?

NAME: Person_4
What in God's holy name are you
blathering about?

NAME: Person_1
I'll tell you what I'm blathering
about!  I got information--new shit
has come to light and--shit, man!
She kidnapped herself!

NAME: Person_1
Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy
wife, I mean, in the parlance of our
times, owes money all over town,
including to known pornographers--
and that's cool, that's cool-- but
I'm saying, she needs money, and of
course they're gonna say they didn't
get it 'cause she wants more, man,
she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
hasn't that ever occurred to you...?
Sir?

NAME: Person_4
No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not
occurred to me.

NAME: Person_6
That had not occurred to us, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Well, okay, you're not privy to all
the new shit, so uh, you know, but
that's what you pay me for.  Speaking
of which, would it be possible for
me to get my twenty grand in cash?
I gotta check this with my accountant
of course, but my concern is that,
you know, it could bump me into a
higher tax--

NAME: Person_4
Brandt, give him the envelope.

NAME: Person_1
Well, okay, if you've already made
out the check.  Brandt is handing
him a letter-sized envelope which is
distended by something inside.

NAME: Person_6
We received it this morning.

NAME: Person_4
Since you have failed to achieve,
even in the modest task that was
your charge, since you have stolen
my money, and since you have
unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

NAME: Person_4
I have no choice but to tell these
bums that they should do whatever is
necessary to recover their money
from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And
with Brandt as my witness, tell you
this:  Any further harm visited upon
Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon
your head.

NAME: Person_4
...By God sir.  I will not abide
another toe.

NAME: Person_2
That wasn't her toe.

NAME: Person_1
Whose toe was it, Walter?

NAME: Person_2
How the fuck should I know?  I do
know that nothing about it indicates--

NAME: Person_1
The nail polish, Walter.

NAME: Person_2
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible
to get some nail polish, apply it to
someone else's toe--

NAME: Person_1
Someone else's--where the fuck are
they gonna--

NAME: Person_2
You want a toe?  I can get you a
toe, believe me.  There are ways,
Dude.  You don't wanna know about
it, believe me.

NAME: Person_1
But Walter--

NAME: Person_2
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this
afternoon--with nail  polish. These
fucking amateurs.   They send us a
toe, we're  supposed to  shit our-
selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My
point is--

NAME: Person_1
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and
then they're gonna kill me--

NAME: Person_2
Well that's just, that's the stress
talking, Dude.  So far we have what
looks to me like a series of
victimless crimes--

NAME: Person_1
What about the toe?

NAME: Side_21
Could you please keep your voices
down--this is a family restaurant.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, please dear!  I've got news for
you: the Supreme Court has roundly
rejected prior restraint!

NAME: Person_1
Walter, this isn't a First Amendment
thing.

NAME: Side_21
Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

NAME: Person_2
Lady, I got buddies who died face-
down in the muck so you and I could
enjoy this family restaurant!

NAME: Person_1
All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry
ma'am.

NAME: Person_2
Don't run away from this, Dude!
Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

NAME: Person_2
Our basic freedoms!

NAME: Person_2
I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

NAME: Person_2
Finishing my coffee.

NAME: Person_7 THROUGH MACHINE
Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer
Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

Auto Circus there on Victory.

NAME: POLICESide_7
You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.
Lebowski. Must've been a joyride
situation; they abandoned the car
once they hit the retaining wall.

NAME: POLICESide_7
These were on the road next to the
car.  You'll have to get in on the
other side.

NAME: Person_1
My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

NAME: POLICESide_7
Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.
You're lucky they left the tape deck
though.

NAME: Person_1
My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's
that smell?

NAME: POLICESide_7
Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept
in the car.  Or perhaps just used it
as a toilet, and moved on.

NAME: Person_1
When will you find these guys?  I
mean, do you have any promising leads?

NAME: POLICESide_7
Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with
the boys down at the Crime Lab.
They've assigned four more detectives
to the case, got us working in shifts.

NAME: Person_5
And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

NAME: Person_2
Oh for Christ--will you shut the
fuck up, Donny.

NAME: Person_1
I figure my only hope is that the
big Lebowski kills me before the
Germans can cut my dick off.

NAME: Person_2
Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No
one is going to cut your dick off.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks Walter.

NAME: Person_2
Not if I have anything to say about
it.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me
a very secure feeling.

NAME: Person_2
Dude--

NAME: Person_1
That makes me feel all warm inside.

NAME: Person_2
Now Dude--

NAME: Person_1
This whole fucking thing--I  could
be sitting here with just pee-stains
on my rug.

NAME: Person_2
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.
Fucking Nazis.

NAME: Person_5
They were Nazis, Dude?

NAME: Person_2
Come on, Donny, they were threatening
castration!

NAME: Person_5
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_2
Are you gonna split hairs?

NAME: Person_5
No--

NAME: Person_2
Am I wrong?

NAME: Person_5
Well--

NAME: Person_1
They're nihilists.

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
They kept saying they believe in
nothing.

NAME: Person_2
Nihilists!  Jesus.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_2
And let's also not forget--let's not
forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife,
an amphibious rodent, for uh,
domestic, you know, within the city--
that isn't legal either.

NAME: Person_1
What're you, a fucking park ranger
now?

NAME: Person_2
No, I'm--

NAME: Person_1
Who gives a shit about the fucking
marmot!

NAME: Person_2
--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

NAME: Person_1
Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need
your sympathy, man, I need my fucking
Johnson!

NAME: Person_5
What do you need that for, Dude?

NAME: Person_2
You gotta buck up, man, you can't go
into the tournament with this negative
attitude--

NAME: Person_1
Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you,
Walter!

NAME: Person_2
Fuck the tournament?!

NAME: Person_2
Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want

Ahh, not so good, man.

NAME: Person_9

fella than m'self once said, sometimes
you eat the bar and sometimes the
bar, wal, he eats you.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern
thing?

NAME: Person_9
Far from it.

NAME: Person_1
Mm.

NAME: Person_9
Much obliged.

NAME: Person_9
I like your style, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Well I like your style too, man.
Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.
D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

NAME: Person_1

NAME: Person_9
Okay, have it your way.

NAME: Person_9
Take it easy, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.  Thanks man.

NAME: Person_7
Dude!  Dude!

NAME: Person_3
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the
doctor.

NAME: Person_1
No it's fine, really, uh--

NAME: Person_3
Do you have any news regarding my
father's money?

NAME: Person_1
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta
respecfully, 69 you know, tender my
resignation on that matter, 'cause
it looks like your mother really was
kidnapped after all.

NAME: Person_3
She most certainly was not!

NAME: Person_1
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen
occasionally?  You might learn
something.  Now I got--

NAME: Person_3
And please don't call her my mother.

NAME: Person_1
Now I got--

NAME: Person_3
She is most definitely the perpetrator
and not the victim.

NAME: Person_1
I'm telling you, I got definitive
evidence--

NAME: Person_3
From who?

NAME: Person_1
The main guy, Dieter--

NAME: Person_3
Dieter Hauff?

NAME: Person_1
Well--yeah, I guess--

NAME: Person_3
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

NAME: Person_1
Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean,
you know him?

NAME: Person_3
Dieter has been on the fringes of--
well, of everything in L.A., for
about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.
Under 'Autobahn.'

NAME: Person_3
That was his group--they released
one album in the mid-seventies.

NAME: Person_1
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

NAME: Person_3
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their
music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

NAME: Person_1
Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

NAME: Person_3
Is he pretending to be the abductor?

NAME: Person_1
Well...yeah--

NAME: Person_3
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really
kidnap someone that you're acquainted
with.  You can't get away with it if
the hostage knows who you are.

NAME: Person_1
Well yeah...I know that.

NAME: Person_3
So Dieter has the money?

NAME: Person_1
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a
complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.
Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to
keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands
in old Duder's--

NAME: Person_3
Do you still have that doctor's
number?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have
the bruise any more, I--

NAME: Person_3
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be
responsible for any delayed after-
effects.

NAME: Person_1
Delayed after-eff--

NAME: Person_3
I want you to see him immediately.

NAME: Person_3
I'll see if he's available.  He's a
good man, and thorough.

NAME: Person_7
Could you slide your shorts down
please, Mr.  Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

NAME: Person_7
I understand sir.  Could you slide
your shorts down please?

NAME: Person_1
Fuck Me.

NAME: Person_1
Fuckola, man.

NAME: Person_2
He lives in North Hollywood on
Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

NAME: Person_1
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

NAME: Person_2
Near the In-and-Out Burger--

NAME: Person_5
Those are good burgers, Walter.

NAME: Person_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid
is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his
father is--are you ready for this?--
Arthur Digby Sellers.

NAME: Person_1
Who the fuck is that?

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

NAME: Person_2
Who the f--have you ever heard of a
little show called Branded, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_2
All but one man died?  There at Bitter
Creek?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show
Walter, so what?

NAME: Person_2
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote
156 episodes, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_2
The bulk of the series.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_2
Not exactly a lightweight.

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Person_2
And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

NAME: Person_1
Uh.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out
there after the, uh, the.

NAME: Person_2
What have you.  We'll, uh--

NAME: Person_5
We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

NAME: Person_2
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh,
brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.
We'll get that fucking money, if he
hasn't spent it already.  Million
fucking clams. And yes, we'll be
near the, uh--some burgers, some
beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking
troubles are over, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Fuck me, man!  That kid's already
spent all the money!

NAME: Person_2
Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's
still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand,
depending on the options.  Wait in
the car, Donny.

NAME: WOSide_7
Jace?

NAME: Person_2
Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter
Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this
is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

NAME: WOSide_7
Jace.

NAME: Person_2
May we uh, we wanted to talk about
little Larry.  May we come in?

NAME: WOSide_7
Jace.

NAME: Side_17
Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

NAME: Person_2
That's him, Dude.

NAME: Side_42
And a good day to you, sir.

NAME: Side_17
See down, please.

NAME: Person_2
Thank you, ma'am.

NAME: Person_2
Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

NAME: Side_17
No, no.  He has healt' problems.

NAME: Person_2
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_2
I just want to say, sir, that we're
both enormous--on a personal level,
Branded, especially the early
episodes, has been a source of, uh,
inspir---

NAME: Side_17
See down, Sweetie.  These are the
policeman--

NAME: Person_2
No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the
impression that we're police exactly.
We're hoping that it will not be
necessary to call the police.

NAME: Person_2
But that is up to little Larry here.
Isn't it, Larry?

NAME: Person_2
Is this your homework, Larry?

NAME: Person_2
Is this your homework, Larry?

NAME: Person_1
Look, man, did you--

NAME: Person_2
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your
homework, Larry?

NAME: Person_1
Just ask him if he--ask him about
the car, man!

NAME: Person_2
Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your
homework, Larry?

NAME: Person_1
Is the car out front yours?

NAME: Person_2
Is this your homework, Larry?

NAME: Person_1
We know it's his fucking homework,
Walter!  Where's the fucking money,
you little brat?

NAME: Person_2
Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard
of Vietnam?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

NAME: Person_2
You're going to enter a world of
pain, son.  We know that this is
your homework.  We know you stole a
car--

NAME: Person_1
And the fucking money!

NAME: Person_2
And the fucking money.  And we know
that this is your homework, Larry.

NAME: Person_2
You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

NAME: Person_2
Ah, this is pointless.

NAME: Person_2
All right, Plan B.  You might want
to watch out the front window there,
Larry.

NAME: Person_2
This is what happens when you FUCK a
STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

NAME: Person_2
Fucking language problem, Dude.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe he'll understand this.

NAME: Person_2
Hunh?

NAME: Person_1
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

NAME: Person_1
I accept your apology. . . No I, I
just want to handle it myself from
now on. . . No.  That has nothing to
do with it. . . .Yes, it made it
home, I'm calling from home.  No,
Walter, it didn't look like Larry
was about to crack.

NAME: Person_1
Well that's your perception. . .
Well you're right, Walter, and the
unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND
LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah,
I'll be at practice.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Side_9
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
Treehorn wants to see you.

NAME: Side_4
And we know which Lebowski you are,
Lebowski.

NAME: Side_9
Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk
to the deadbeat Lebowski.

NAME: Side_4
You're not dealing with morons here.

NAME: Side_7
Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm
Jackie Treehorn.

NAME: Person_1
This is quite a pad you got here,
man.  Completely unspoiled.

NAME: Side_1
What's your drink, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
White Russian, thanks.  How's the
smut business, Jackie?

NAME: Side_1
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in
publishing, entertainment, political
advocacy, and--

NAME: Person_1
Which one was Logjammin'?

NAME: Side_1
Regrettably, it's true, standards
have fallen in adult entertainment.
It's video, Dude.  Now that we're
competing with the amateurs, we can't
afford to invest that little extra
in story, production value, feeling.

NAME: Side_1
People forget that the brain is the
biggest erogenous zone--

NAME: Person_1
On you, maybe.

NAME: Side_1
Of course, you do get the good with
the bad.  The new technology permits
us to do exciting things with
interactive erotic software.  Wave
of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off
manually.

NAME: Side_1
Of course you do.  I can see you're
anxious for me to get to the point.
Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

NAME: Person_1
I thought you might know, man.

NAME: Side_1
Me?  How would I know?  The only
reason she ran off was to get away
from her rather sizable debt to me.

NAME: Person_1
But she hasn't run off, she's been--

NAME: Side_1
I've heard the kidnapping story, so
save it.  I know you're mixed up in
all this, Dude, and I don't care
what you're trying to take off her
husband.  That's your business.  All
I'm saying is, I want mine.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, well, right man, there are
many facets to this, uh, you know,
many interested parties.  If I can
find your money, man-- what's in it
for the Dude?

NAME: Side_1
Of course, there's that to discuss.
Refill?

NAME: Person_1
Does the Pope shit in the woods?

NAME: Side_1
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

NAME: Person_1
Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way
you do business.  Your money is being
held by a kid named Larry Sellers.
He lives in North Hollywood, on
Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.
A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure
your goons'll be able to get it off
him, mean he's only fifteen and he's
flunking social studies.  So if you'll
just write me a check for my ten per
cent. . . of half a million. . .
fifty grand.

NAME: Person_1
I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you
mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

NAME: Side_1
A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your
idea of a joke?

NAME: Person_1
No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's
got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just
wanted a car.  All the Dude ever
wanted. . . was his rug back. . .
not greedy. . . it really.

NAME: Person_9'S Person_7
Darkness warshed over the Dude--
darker'n a black steer's tookus on a
moonless prairie night.  There was
no bottom.

NAME: Person_1
He was innocent.  Not a charge was
true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

NAME: Side_11
This is your only I.D.?

NAME: Person_1
I know my rights.

NAME: Side_11
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

NAME: Person_1
I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I
want Bill Kunstler.

NAME: Side_11
What are you, some kind of sad-assed
refugee from the fucking sixties?

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Side_11
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to
eject you from his garden party,
that you were drunk and abusive.

NAME: Person_1
That guy treats women like objects,
man.

NAME: Side_11
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in
this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw
shit.  We got a nice quiet beach
community here, and I aim to keep it
nice and quiet.  So let me make
something plain.  I don't like you
sucking around bothering our citizens,
Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
off name, I don't like your jerk-off
face, I don't like your jerk- off
behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
off --do I make myself clear?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

NAME: Person_1
--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

NAME: Side_11
Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

NAME: Side_11
Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep
your ugly fucking goldbricking ass
out of my beach community!

NAME: Person_1
Jesus, man, can you change the
station?

NAME: Side_15
Fuck you man!  You don't like my
fucking music, get your own fucking
cab!

NAME: Person_1
I've had a--

NAME: Side_15
I pull over and kick your ass out,
man!

NAME: Person_1
--had a rough night, and I hate the
fucking Eagles, man--

NAME: Side_15
That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

NAME: Person_1
Jesus.

NAME: Person_3
Jeffrey.

NAME: Person_1
Maude?

NAME: Person_3
Love me.

NAME: Person_1
That's my robe.

NAME: Person_3
Tell me a little about yourself,
Jeffrey.

NAME: Person_1
Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

NAME: Person_1
I was, uh, one of the authors of the
Port Huron Statement.--The original
Port Huron Statement.

NAME: Person_3
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_1
Not the compromised second draft.
And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the
Seattle Seven?

NAME: Person_3
Mmnun.

NAME: Person_1
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music
business briefly.

NAME: Person_3
Oh?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed
of Sound Tour.

NAME: Person_3
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_1
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you
know, little of this, little of that.
My career's, uh, slowed down a bit
lately.

NAME: Person_3
What do you do for fun?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.
Drive around.  The occasional acid
flashback.

NAME: Person_3
What happened to your house?

NAME: Person_1
Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.
Wanted to save the finder's fee.

NAME: Person_3
Finder's fee?

NAME: Person_1
He thought I had your father's money,
so he got me out of the way while he
looked for it.

NAME: Person_3
It's not my father's money, it's the
Foundation's.  Why did he think you
had it?  And who does?

NAME: Person_1
Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.
Real fucking brat.

NAME: Person_3
Jeffrey--

NAME: Person_1
It's a complicated case, Maude.
Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately
I've been adhering to a pretty strict,
uh, drug regimen to keep my mind,
you know, limber.  I'm real fucking
close to your father's money, real
fucking close.  It's just--

NAME: Person_3
I keep telling you, it's the
Foundation's money.  Father doesn't
have any.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

NAME: Person_3
No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

NAME: Person_1
But your father--he runs stuff, he--

NAME: Person_3
We did let Father run one of the
companies, briefly, but he didn't do
very well at it.

NAME: Person_1
But he's--

NAME: Person_3
He helps administer the charities
now, and I give him a reasonable
allowance.  He has no money of his
own.  I know how he likes to present
himself; Father's weakness is vanity.
Hence the slut.

NAME: Person_1
Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is
that yoga?

NAME: Person_3
It increases the chances of
conception.

NAME: Person_1
Increases?

NAME: Person_3
Well yes, what did you think this
was all about?  Fun and games?

NAME: Person_1
Well...no, of course not--

NAME: Person_3
I want a child.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

NAME: Person_3
Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.
In fact I don't want the father to
be someone I have to see socially,
or who'll have any interest in rearing
the child himself.

NAME: Person_1
Huh...

NAME: Person_1
So...that doctor.

NAME: Person_3
Exactly.  What happened to your face?
Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

NAME: Person_1
No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.
A real reactionary. . . So your
father. . . Oh man, I get it!

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, my thinking about the case,
man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.
Your father--

NAME: PHONE Person_7
This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in;
leave a message after the beep.

NAME: Person_3'S Person_7
What're you talking about?

NAME: Person_1
Walter, if you're there, pick up the
fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter,
this is an emergency.  I'm not--

NAME: Person_2
Dude?

NAME: Person_1
Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I
need you to come pick me up--

NAME: Person_2
I can't drive, Dude, it's erev
shabbas.

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_2
Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm
not even supposed to pick up the
phone, unless it's an emergency.

NAME: Person_1
It is a fucking emergency.

NAME: Person_2
I understand.  That's why I picked
up the phone.

NAME: Person_1
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind,
just call Donny then, and ask him to--

NAME: Person_2
Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

NAME: Person_3'S Person_7
Jeffrey?

NAME: Person_1
Get out of that fucking car, man!

NAME: Person_1
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on,
man!

NAME: Side_7
Relax, man!  No physical harm
intended!

NAME: Person_1
Who the fuck are you?  Why've you
been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

NAME: Side_7
Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

NAME: Person_1
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

NAME: Side_7
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking
about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a
private snoop!  Like you, man!

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Side_6
A dick, man!  And let me tell you
something: I dig your work. Playing
one side against the other--in bed
with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay
away from my fucking lady friend,
man.

NAME: Side_6
Hey hey, I'm not messing with your
special lady--

NAME: Person_1
She's not my special lady, she's my
fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping
her conceive, man!

NAME: Side_6
Hey, man, I'm not--

NAME: Person_1
Who're you working for?  Lebowski?
Jackie Treehorn?

NAME: Side_6
The Gundersons.

NAME: Person_1
The?  Who the fff--

NAME: Side_6
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering
daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.
Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.
Her parents want her back.

NAME: Side_6
See?

NAME: Person_1
Jesus fucking Christ.

NAME: Side_6
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

NAME: Person_1
Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on
the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

NAME: Side_6
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, it sucks.

NAME: Side_6
Well maybe you and me could pool our
resources--trade information--
professional courtesy--compeers, you
know--

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.
And stay away from my special la--
from my fucking lady friend.

NAME: Side_21
You folks ready?

NAME: Side_3
I haff lingenberry pancakes.

NAME: Side_18
Lingenberry pancakes.

NAME: Side_30
Sree picks in blanket.

NAME: Side_3
Lingenberry pancakes.

NAME: Person_1
I mean we totally fucked it up, man.
We fucked up his pay-off.  And got
the kidnappers all pissed off, and
the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot,
but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

NAME: Person_2
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic,
uh.

NAME: Person_1
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
up, then why does he still leave me
in charge of getting back his wife?
Because he fucking doesn't want her
back, man!  He's had enough!  He no
longer digs her!  It's all a show!
But then, why didn't he give a shit
about his million bucks?  I mean, he
knew we didn't hand off his briefcase,
but he never asked for it back.

NAME: Person_2
What's your point, Dude?

NAME: Person_1
His million bucks was never in it,
man!  There was no money in that
briefcase!  He was hoping they'd
kill her!  You throw out a ringer
for a ringer!

NAME: Person_2
Yeah?

NAME: Person_1
Shit yeah!

NAME: Person_2
Okay, but how does all this add up
to an emergency?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_2
I'm saying, I see what you're getting
at, Dude, he kept the money, but my
point is, here we are, it's shabbas,
the sabbath, which I'm allowed to
break only if it's a matter of life
and death--

NAME: Person_1
Walter, come off it.  You're not
even fucking Jewish, you're--

NAME: Person_2
What the fuck are you talking about?

NAME: Person_1
You're fucking Polish Catholic--

NAME: Person_2
What the fuck are you talking about?
I converted when I married Cynthia!
Come on, Dude!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, and you were--

NAME: Person_2
You know this!

NAME: Person_1
And you were divorced five fucking
years ago.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah?  What do you think happens
when you get divorced?  You turn in
your library card?  Get a new driver's
license?  Stop being Jewish?

NAME: Person_1
This driveway.

NAME: Person_2
I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

NAME: Person_1
It's just part of your whole sick
Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her
fucking dog.  Going to her fucking
synagogue.  You're living in the
fucking past.

NAME: Person_2
NAME: Side_45
Three thousand years of beautiful
tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell
happened?

NAME: Person_2
Jesus Christ.

NAME: Person_6
He can't see you, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Where'd she been?

NAME: Person_6
Visiting friends of hers in Palm
Springs.  Just picked up and left,
never bothered to tell us.

NAME: Person_1
But I guess she told Dieter.

NAME: Person_2
Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped
her.

NAME: Person_6
Who's this gentleman, Dude?

NAME: Person_2
Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

NAME: Person_6
You shouldn't go in there, Dude!
He's very angry!

NAME: Person_4
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

NAME: Person_1
Where's the money, Lebowski?

NAME: Person_4
Who the hell is he?

NAME: Person_2
I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy
who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY

NAME: Person_1
We know the briefcase was empty,
man.  We know you kept the million
bucks yourself.

NAME: Person_4
Well, you have your story, I have
mine.  I say I entrusted the money
to you, and you stole it.

NAME: Person_1
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped
and you could use it as a pretext to
make some money disappear.  All you
needed was a sap to pin it on, and
you'd just met me.  You thought,
hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone
the square community won't give a
shit about.

Jeffrey Lebowski.

NAME: Person_2
Walter Sobchak.

NAME: Person_1
The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

NAME: Side_2
Excuse me?

NAME: Person_1
Nothing.

NAME: Side_2
Yes.  I understand you're taking
away the remains.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Side_2
We have the urn.

NAME: Side_2
And I assume this is credit card?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_2
What's this?

NAME: Side_2
That is for the urn.

NAME: Person_2
Don't need it.  We're scattering the
ashes.

NAME: Side_2
Yes, so we were informed.  However,
we must of course transmit the remains
to you in a receptacle.

NAME: Person_2
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

NAME: Side_2
Yes sir.  It is our most modestly
priced receptacle.

NAME: Person_1
Well can we--

NAME: Person_2
A hundred and eighty dollars?!

NAME: Side_2
They range up to three thousand.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, but we're--

NAME: Person_1
Can we just rent it from you?

NAME: Side_2
Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental
house.

NAME: Person_2
We're scattering the fucking ashes!

NAME: Person_1
Walter--

NAME: Side_2
Sir, please lower your voice--

NAME: Person_1
Hey man, don't you have something
else you could put it in?

NAME: Side_2
That is our most modestly priced
receptacle.

NAME: Person_2
I'll say a few words.

NAME: Person_2
Donny was a good bowler, and a good
man.  He was. . . He was one of us.
He was a man who loved the outdoors,
and bowling, and as a surfer explored
the beaches of southern California
from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he
was an avid bowler.  And a good
friend.  He died--he died as so many
of his generation, before his time.
In your wisdom you took him, Lord.
As you took so many bright flowering
young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc
and Hill 364.  These young men gave
their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny
who. . . who loved bowling.

NAME: Person_2
And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos,
in accordance with what we think
your dying wishes might well have
been, we commit your mortal remains
to the bosom of.

NAME: Person_2
the Pacific Ocean, which you loved
so well.

NAME: Person_2
Goodnight, sweet prince.

NAME: Person_2
Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

NAME: Person_2
Goddamn wind.

NAME: Person_1
Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking
asshole!

NAME: Person_2
Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

NAME: Person_1
You make everything a fucking
travesty!

NAME: Person_2
Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

NAME: Person_1
What about that shit about Vietnam!

NAME: Person_2
Dude, I'm sorry--

NAME: Person_1
What the fuck does Vietnam have to
do with anything!  What the fuck
were you talking about?!

NAME: Person_2
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

NAME: Person_1
You're a fuck, Walter!

NAME: Person_2
Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

NAME: Person_1
Two oat sodas, Gary.

NAME: Side_23
Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks, man.

NAME: Side_23
Sorry to hear about Donny.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you
eat the bear, and, uh.

NAME: Person_9
Howdy do, Dude.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered
if I'd see you again.

NAME: Person_9
Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things

NAME: Person_1
Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters,
ups and downs.

NAME: Person_9
Sure, I gotcha.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I
gotta get back.

NAME: Person_9
Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know
that you will.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude
abides.

NAME: Person_9
The Dude abides.

NAME: Person_9
I don't know about you, but I take
comfort in that.  It's good knowin'
he's out there, the Dude, takin' her
easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I
sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp,
that about does her, wraps her all
up.  Things seem to've worked out
pretty good for the Dude'n Walter,
and it was a purt good story, dontcha
think?   Made me laugh to beat the
band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I
didn't like seein' Donny go. But
then, happen to know that there's a
little Lebowski on the way.  I guess
that's the way the whole durned human
comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self,
down through the generations, westward
the wagons, across the sands a time
until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin'
again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed
yourselves.

NAME: Person_9
Catch ya further on down the trail.

NAME: Person_9
...Say friend, ya got any more a
that good sarsaparilla?...

Wow.

NAME: Side_6
Mmm.

NAME: Person_1
Wow.

NAME: Side_6
Mmm-hmm.

NAME: Person_1
Wow.

NAME: Side_6
Yes, Marlin. No, I see it. It's beautiful.

NAME: Side_6
My man delivered.

NAME: Person_1
And it wasn't so easy.

NAME: Side_6
Because a lot of other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

NAME: Person_1
You better believe they did--every single one of them.

NAME: Side_6
Mm-hmm. You did good. And the neighborhood is awesome.

NAME: Person_1
So, you do like it, don't you?

NAME: Side_6
No, no. I do, I do. I really do like it. But Marlin, I know that the drop off is desirable
with the great schools and the amazing view and all, but do we really need so much space?

NAME: Person_1
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best. Look, look,
look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and they'll see a whale! See, right by
their bedroom window.

NAME: Side_6
Shhh, you're gonna wake the kids.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, right. Right.

NAME: Side_6
Aww, look. They're dreaming. We still have to name them.

NAME: Person_1
You wanna name all of 'em, right now? All right, we'll name this half Marlin Jr. and then
this half Coral Jr. Okay, we're done.

NAME: Side_6
I like Nemo.

NAME: Person_1
Nemo? Well, we'll name one Nemo but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

NAME: Side_6
Just think that in a couple of days, we're gonna be parents!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. What if they don't like me?

NAME: Side_6
Marlin.

NAME: Person_1
No, really.

NAME: Side_6
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are, one of them is bound to like you.

NAME: Side_6
What?

NAME: Person_1
You remember how we met?

NAME: Side_6
Well, I try not to.

NAME: Person_1
Well, I remember. 'Excuse me, miss, can you check and see if there's a hook in my lip?'

NAME: Side_6
Marlin!

NAME: Side_6
Get away!

NAME: Person_1
Here he is. Cutie's here! Where did everybody go?

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Person_1
Coral! Coral?

NAME: Person_1
Coral? Oh!

NAME: Person_1
Ohh. There, there, there. It's okay, daddy's here. Daddy's got you. I promise, I will
never let anything happen to you...Nemo.

NAME: Person_3
First day of school! First day of school! Wake up, wake up! C'mon, first day of school!

NAME: Person_1
I don't wanna go to school. Five more minutes.

NAME: Person_3
Not you, dad. Me!

NAME: Person_1
Okay...huh?

NAME: Person_3
Get up, get up! It's time for school! It's time for school! It's time for school!
It's time for school! Oh boy! Oh boy!

NAME: Person_1
All right, I'm up.

NAME: Person_3
Oh boy--whoa!

NAME: Person_1
Nemo!

NAME: Person_3
First day of school!

NAME: Person_3
No.

NAME: Person_1
Sometimes you can't tell 'cause fluid is rushing to the area. Now, any rushing fluids?

NAME: Person_3
No.

NAME: Person_1
Are you woozy?

NAME: Person_3
No.

NAME: Person_1
How many stripes do I have?

NAME: Person_3
I'm fine.

NAME: Person_1
Answer the stripe question!

NAME: Person_3
Three.

NAME: Person_1
No! See, something's wrong with you. I have one, two, three--that's all I have? Oh,
you're okay. How's the lucky fin?

NAME: Person_3
Lucky.

NAME: Person_1
Let's see.

NAME: Person_1
Are you sure you wanna go to school this year? 'Cause there's no problem if you don't.
You can wait 5 or 6 years.

NAME: Person_3
Come on, dad. It's time for school.

NAME: Person_1
Ah-ah-ah! Forgot to brush.

NAME: Person_3
Ohh...

NAME: Person_1
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

NAME: Person_3
Yes.

NAME: Person_1
Brush.

NAME: Person_3
Okay, I'm done.

NAME: Person_1
You missed a spot.

NAME: Person_3
Where?

NAME: Person_1
There. Ha ha! Right there. And here and here and here!

NAME: Person_1
All right, we're excited. First day of school, here we go. We're ready to learn to get
some knowledge. Now, what's the one thing we have to remember about the ocean?

NAME: Person_3
It's not safe.

NAME: Person_1
That's my boy. So, first we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.
And then we go out, and back in. And then one more time--out and back in. And sometimes,
if you wanna do it four times--

NAME: Person_3
Dad..

NAME: Person_1
All right. Come on, boy.

NAME: Person_3
Dad, maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark!

NAME: Person_3
Have you ever met a shark?

NAME: Person_1
No, and I don't plan to.

NAME: Person_3
How old are sea turtles?

NAME: Person_1
Sea turtles? I don't know.

NAME: Person_3
Sandy Plankton from next door, he said that sea turtles, said that they live to be about
a hundred years old!

NAME: Person_1
Well, you know what, if I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him. After I'm done talking
to the shark, okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, hold on, wait to cross. Hold my fin,
hold my fin.

NAME: Person_3
Dad, you're not gonna freak out like you did at the petting zoo, are you?

NAME: Person_1
Hey, that snail was about to charge. Hmm, I wonder where we're supposed to go.

NAME: Side_24 Side_32
Bye, mom!

NAME: Side_24 MOM
I'll pick you up after school.

NAME: Side_36 KID
Come on, you guys. Stop it! Give it back!

NAME: Person_1
Come on, we'll try over there.

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me, is this where we meet his teacher?

NAME: Side_13
Well, look who's out of the anemone.

NAME: Person_1
Yes. Shocking, I know.

NAME: Side_13
Marty, right?

NAME: Person_1
Marlin.

NAME: Side_13
Bob.

NAME: Side_25
Ted.

NAME: Side_26
Bill. Hey, you're a clownfish. You're funny, right? Hey, tell us a joke.

NAME: Side_13/Side_25
Yeah, yeah. Come on, give us a funny one.

NAME: Person_1
Well, actually, that's a common misconception. Clownfish are no funnier than any
other fish.

NAME: Side_26
Aw, come on, clownie.

NAME: Side_25
Yeah, do something funny.

NAME: Side_13
Yeah!

NAME: Person_1
All right, I   know one joke. Um, there's a mollusk, see? And he walks up to a sea, well he
doesn't walk   up, he swims up. Well, actually the mollusk isn't moving. He's in one place
and then the   sea cucumber, well they--I mixed up. There was a mollusk and a sea cucumber.
None of them   were walking, so forget that I--

NAME: Side_13
Sheldon! Get out of Mr. Johansenn's yard, now!

NAME: Side_32
Whoa!

NAME: Side_44
All right, you kids! Ooh! Uuh, where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where, where'd you go?

NAME: Person_3
Dad, dad...can I go play too? Can I?

NAME: Person_1
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

NAME: Person_1
That's where I would play

NAME: Side_16
What's wrong with his fin?

NAME: Side_14
He looks funny!

NAME: Side_19
Ow! Hey, what'd I do? What'd I do?

NAME: Side_13
Be nice. It's his first time at school.

NAME: Person_1
He was born with it, kids. We call it his lucky fin.

NAME: Person_3
Dad.

NAME: Side_16
See this tentacle? It's actually shorter than all my other tentacles but you can't really
tell.Especially when I twirl them like this.

NAME: Side_14
I'm obnoxious.

NAME: Side_32
Mr. Ray!

NAME: Side_19
Come on, Nemo.

NAME: Person_1
Whoa, you better stay with me.

NAME: Side_4
Huh, I wonder where my class has gone?

NAME: Person_3
Dad, you can go now.

NAME: Side_4
Well, hello. Who is this?

NAME: Person_3
I'm Nemo.

NAME: Side_4
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

NAME: Person_3
Okay.

NAME: Side_4
You live in what kind of home?

NAME: Person_3
An anemo-none. A nemenem-menome-nememen-nenemone--

NAME: Side_4
Okay, okay, don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard, explorers!

NAME: Person_1
Just so you know, he's got a little fin. I find if he's having trouble swimming, let him
take a break. Ten, fifteen minutes.

NAME: Person_3
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

NAME: Side_4
Don't worry. We're gonna stay together as a group. Okay, class, optical orbits up front.
And remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves...that means you, Jimmy.

NAME: Side_45
Aw, man!

NAME: Person_1
Bye, Nemo!

NAME: Person_3
Bye, dad!

NAME: Person_1
Bye, son! Be safe.

NAME: Side_13
Hey, you're doing pretty well for a first timer.

NAME: Person_1
Well, you can't hold onto them forever, can you?

NAME: Side_26
Yeah, I had a tough time when my oldest went out at the drop off.

NAME: Person_1
They just gotta grow up--the drop off?! They're going to the drop off?! Wh-what are you,
insane?! Why don't we fry 'em up now and serve them with chips!?

NAME: Side_13
Hey, Marty. Calm down.

NAME: Person_1
Don't tell me to be calm, pony boy!

NAME: Side_13
'Pony boy'?

NAME: Side_26
You know for a clownfish, he really isn't that funny.

NAME: Side_25
Pity.

NAME: Person_3
Whoa.

NAME: Side_14
Come on, let's go.

NAME: Person_3
Hey guys, wait up! Whoa.

NAME: Side_14
Cool.

NAME: Side_14
Saved your life!

NAME: Side_16
Aw, you guys made me ink.

NAME: Person_3
What's that?

NAME: Side_14
I know what that is. Oh, oh! Sandy Plankton saw one. He called, he said it was called a...a
butt.

NAME: Person_3
Whoa.

NAME: Side_16
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

NAME: Side_19
Oh yeah? Let's see you get closer.

NAME: Side_16
Okay. Beat that.

NAME: Side_14
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

NAME: Person_3
Uh, my dad says it's not safe.

NAME: Person_1
Nemo, no!

NAME: Person_3
Dad?

NAME: Person_1
You were about to swim into open water!

NAME: Person_3
No, I wasn't go out--but dad!

NAME: Person_1
It was a good thing I was here. If I hadn't showed up, I don't know--

NAME: Side_16
Sir, he wasn't gonna go.

NAME: Side_14
Yeah, he was too afraid.

NAME: Person_3
No, I wasn't.

NAME: Person_1
This does not concern you, kids. And you're lucky I don't tell your parents you were out
there.
You know you can't swim well.

NAME: Person_3
I can swim fine, dad, okay?

NAME: Person_1
No, it's not okay. You shouldn't be anywhere near here. Okay, I was right. You'll start school
in a year or two.

NAME: Person_3
No, dad! Just because you're scared of the ocean--

NAME: Person_1
Clearly, you're not ready. And you're not coming back until you are. You think you can do
these
things but you just can't, Nemo!

NAME: Person_3
I hate you.

NAME: Side_4
There's--nothing to see. Gather, uh, over there. Excuse me, is there anything I can do? I am a
scientist, sir. Is there any problem?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt things. He isn't a good swimmer and it's a little
too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

NAME: Side_4
Well, I can assure you, he's quite safe with me.

NAME: Side_24 KID
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea!

NAME: Person_1
Nemo! What do you think you're doing? You're gonna get stuck out there and I'll have to get
you before another fish does! Get back here! I said get back here, now! Stop! You take one
move, mister. Don't youdare! If you put one fin on that boat..are you listening to me?
Don't touch the bo--Nemo!

NAME: Person_1
You paddle your little tail back here, Nemo. That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.
Do you hear me? Big...big--

NAME: Person_3
Aaaah! Daddy! Help me!

NAME: Person_1
I'm coming, Nemo!

NAME: Side_32
Aaaah!

NAME: Side_4
Get under me, kids!

NAME: Person_3
Ah! Oh no! Dad! Daddy!

NAME: Person_1
Oh! Nemo! Unh! Nemo! Nemo, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No! No! Aah! Nemo! Nemo!

NAME: Side_47
Whoa! Hold on.

NAME: Person_1
Oh no. No, no. It's gone, it's gone. No, no, it can't be gone. No, no! Nemo! Nemo! Nemo! No!
Nemo! Nemo! No! No, please, no! No, no!

NAME: Person_1
Has anybody seen a boat!? Please! A white boat! They took my son! My son! Help me, please!

NAME: Person_2
Look out!

Waaaah!

Ooh, ooh...

Ohh. Oh, oh. Sorry! I didn't see you. Sir, are you okay?

NAME: Person_1
He's gone, he's gone..

NAME: Person_2
There, there. It's all right.

NAME: Person_1
He's gone.

NAME: Person_2
It'll be okay.

NAME: Person_1
No, no. They took him away. I have to find the boat.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, I've seen a boat.

NAME: Person_1
You have?

NAME: Person_2
It passed by not too long ago.

NAME: Person_1
A white one?

NAME: Person_2
Hi. I'm Dory.

NAME: Person_1
Where!? Which way!?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, oh, oh! It-it went, um, this way! And it went this way! Follow me!

NAME: Person_2
No problem.

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Wait!

NAME: Person_2
Will you quit it?

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
I'm trying to swim here. What, ocean ain't big enough for you?

NAME: Person_1
Huh?

NAME: Person_2
You got a problem, buddy? Huh? Huh? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? Do 'ya? You want a piece of me? Yeah,
oooh, I'm scared now. Whaat!?

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute..

NAME: Person_2
Stop following me, okay!?

NAME: Person_1
What? You're showing me which way the boat went!

NAME: Person_2
A boat? Hey, I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago. It went this way, it went this
way. Follow me!

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute, wait a minute! What is going on? You already told me which way the boat
was going!

NAME: Person_2
I did? Oh dear...

NAME: Person_1
If this is some kind of practical joke, it's not funny! And I know funny..I'm a clownfish!

NAME: Person_2
No, it's not. I know it's not. I'm so sorry. See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

NAME: Person_1
Short-term memory loss..I don't believe this!

NAME: Person_2
No, it's true. I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family..or at least I think
it does. Hmmm..where are they? Can I help you?

NAME: Person_8
Hello.

NAME: Person_2
Well, hi!

NAME: Person_8
Name's Bruce. It's all right, I understand. Why trust a shark, right? So, what's a couple of
bites like you doing out so late, eh?

NAME: Person_1
Nothing. We're not doing anything. We're not even out.

NAME: Person_8
Great! Then how'd you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm havin'?

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, yeah, that's right--a party! What do you say?

NAME: Person_2
Ooh, I love parties! Parties are fun!

NAME: Person_1
Parties are fun, and it's tempting but--

NAME: Person_8
Oh, come on, I insist.

NAME: Person_1
O-okay..that's all that matters.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, look--balloons! It is a party!

NAME: Person_8
Ha ha ha! Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy. You wouldn't want
one of them to pop.

NAME: Person_8
Anchor! Chum!

NAME: Side_8
There you are, Bruce, finally!

NAME: Person_8
We got company.

NAME: Side_8
It's about time, mate.

NAME: Side_5
We've already gone through all the snacks and I'm still starvin'!

NAME: Side_8
We almost had a feeding frenzy.

NAME: Side_5
Come on, let's get this over with.

NAME: Person_8
Right, then. The meeting has officially come to order. Let us all say the pledge..

NAME: Person_8/Side_8/Side_5
'I am a nice shark, not a mindless eating machine. If I am to change this image, I must
first change myself. Fish are friends, not food'.

NAME: Side_8
Except stinkin' dolphins.

NAME: Side_5
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're sooo cute! 'Hey, look at me. I'm a flippin' little dolphin!
Let me flip for 'ya! Ain't I a somethin'!'

NAME: Person_8
Right, then. Today's meeting is step 5, 'BRING A Side_24 FRIEND'. Now do you all have your
friends?

NAME: Side_8
Got mine.

NAME: Person_2
Hey there!

NAME: Person_8
How 'bout you, Chum?

NAME: Side_5
Oh, um, I seem to have misplaced my uh, friend.

NAME: Person_8
That's all right, Chum. I had a feeling this would be a difficult step, you can help yourself
to one of my friends.

NAME: Side_5
Oh, thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum, eh?

NAME: Person_8
I'll start the testimonies. Hello, my name is Bruce.

NAME: Side_8/Side_5
Hello, Bruce.

NAME: Person_8
It has been three weeks since my last fish, on my honor, or may I be chopped up and
made into soup.

NAME: Side_5
You're an inspiration to all of us.

NAME: Side_8
Amen.

NAME: Person_8
Right, then. Who's next?

NAME: Person_2
Ooh! Pick me! Pick me!

NAME: Person_8
Yes, the little Sheila down the front.

NAME: Person_2
Woo-hoo!

NAME: Person_8
Come on up here.

NAME: Person_2
Hi. I'm Dory.

NAME: Person_8/Side_8/Side_5
Hello, Dory.

NAME: Person_2
And, uh, well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

NAME: Side_5
Hey, that's incredible.

NAME: Person_8
Good on 'ya, mate!

NAME: Person_2
Whew! I'm glad I got that off my chest.

NAME: Person_8
All right, anyone else? Hello, how 'bout you, mate? What's your problem?

NAME: Person_1
Me? I don't have a problem.

NAME: Person_8
Oh. Okay..

NAME: Person_8/Side_8/Side_5
Denial.

NAME: Person_8
Just start with your name.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Uh, hello. My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish--

NAME: Side_5
A clownfish? Really?!

NAME: Person_8
Go on, tell us a joke!

NAME: Side_5
Ooh! I love jokes!

NAME: Person_1
Actually I do know one that's pretty good. There was this mollusk and he walks up to a sea
cucumber. Normally, they don't talk, sea cucumbers, but in a joke, everyone talks. So the
sea mollusk says to the cucumber...

NAME: Person_3
Daddy!

NAME: Person_1
Nemo!

NAME: Side_5
Nemo! Ha ha ha! Nemo! I don't get it.

NAME: Person_8
For a clownfish, he's not that funny.

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no, no. He's my son. He was taken by these divers.

NAME: Person_2
Oh my, you poor fish.

NAME: Side_5
Humans. Think they own everything.

NAME: Side_8
Probably American.

NAME: Person_8
Now there is a father looking for his little boy.

NAME: Person_1
Ugh! What do these markings mean?

NAME: Side_5
Aw, come here.

NAME: Side_8
Group hug.

NAME: Side_5
We're all mates here, mate.

NAME: Person_1
I can't read human.

NAME: Person_2
Well then we gotta find a fish who can read this. Hey, look. Sharks!

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no, Dory!

NAME: Person_2
Guys, guys!

NAME: Person_1
No, Dory!

NAME: Person_2
That's mine! Give it to me! Gimme! Oww!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

NAME: Person_2
Ow, ow, ow.

NAME: Person_1
I'm so sorry.

NAME: Person_2
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

NAME: Person_1
Ohh...

NAME: Person_2
Ow, ow, ow.

NAME: Person_8
Dory, are you oka--oohh. Oohh, that's good.

NAME: Side_8/Side_5
Intervention!

NAME: Person_8
Just a bite!

NAME: Side_8
Hold it together, mate!

NAME: Side_5
Remember, Bruce, fish are friends, not food!

NAME: Person_1
Dory, look out!

NAME: Person_8
I'm havin' fish tonight!

NAME: Side_5
Remember the steps, mate!

NAME: Person_8
Just one bite!

NAME: Person_8
G'day!

NAME: Person_1/Person_2
Aaaaaaaah!

NAME: Person_8
Arrrr!

NAME: Person_1
There's no way out! There's got to be a way to escape!

NAME: Person_2
Who is it?

NAME: Person_1
Dory, help me find a way out!

NAME: Person_2
Sorry, you'll have to come back later. We're trying to escape.

NAME: Person_1
There's gotta be a way out!

NAME: Person_2
Look, here's something! 'ESSS-CA-PE'! I wonder what that means. It's funny, it's spelled
just like the word 'escape'.

NAME: Person_1
Let's go!

NAME: Person_8
Here's Brucey!

NAME: Person_2
I can read? That's right, I can read!

NAME: Person_1
Well, then here. Read this now!

NAME: Side_8
He really doesn't mean it, y'know! He never even knew his father!

NAME: Side_5
Don't fall off the wagon!

NAME: Person_1
Oh no, it's blocked!

NAME: Side_8
No, Bruce. Focus!

NAME: Side_5
Sorry about--this, mate!

NAME: Side_8
He's really--a nice guy!

NAME: Person_1
I need to get that mask!

NAME: Person_2
You want that mask? Okay.

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no, no, no, no!

NAME: Person_1
Quick grab the mask!

NAME: Side_8
Oh no. Bruce?

NAME: Person_2
Aw, is the party over?

NAME: Side_17
Nice.

NAME: Person_3
Dad? Daddy?

NAME: Side_1
Barbara?

NAME: Side_21
Uh-huh?

NAME: Side_1
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please? And I'm going to need a few cotton rolls.

NAME: Side_21
Okay.

NAME: Side_1
Hello, little fella!

NAME: Person_3
Aah!

NAME: Side_1
Heh heh heh! Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life out on the reef and
I saved him. So, has that novocaine kicked in yet?

NAME: Side_27
I think so. We're ready to roll.

NAME: Person_6
He likes bubbles.

NAME: Person_3
Aah! Ohh! No! Uhh!

NAME: Side_11
Bonjour.

NAME: Person_3
Aah!

NAME: Person_5
Heh heh! Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

NAME: Side_3
Oh, he's scared to death.

NAME: Person_3
I wanna go home. Do you know where my dad is?

NAME: Person_6
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

NAME: Person_3
Pet store?

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, you know, like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart.

NAME: Person_7
Pet Palace.

NAME: Side_10
Fish-O-Rama.

NAME: Side_3
Mail order.

NAME: Person_6
Ebay.

NAME: Person_7
So which one is it?

NAME: Person_3
I'm from the ocean.

NAME: Person_7
Ah, the ocean. The ocean! Aaah! He hasn't been decontaminated yet! Jacques!

NAME: Side_11
Oui.

NAME: Person_7
Clean him!

NAME: Side_11
Oui.

NAME: Person_7
Ocean!

NAME: Side_11
Ooh, la mer. Bon. Voila. He is clean.

NAME: Side_10
Wow. The big blue. What's it like?

NAME: Person_3
Big...and blue?

NAME: Side_10
I knew it.

NAME: Side_3
Kid, if there's anything you need, just ask your auntie Deb, that's me. Or if I'm not
around, you can always talk to my sister Flo. Hi,how are you? Don't listen to anything
my sister says, she's nuts! Ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_5
Can't hear you, Peach.

NAME: Person_6
I said we got a live one.

NAME: Person_7
Yes!

NAME: Person_5
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

NAME: Side_3
What do we got?

NAME: Person_6
Root canal, and by the looks of those x-rays it's not gonna be pretty.

NAME: Side_27
Owwwwwwwww!

NAME: Person_5
Rubber dam and clamp installed?

NAME: Person_6
Yep.

NAME: Person_7
What did he use to open?

NAME: Person_6
Gator-Glidden drill. He seems to be favoring that one lately.

NAME: Side_3
I can't see, Flo.

NAME: Side_27
You're getting a little too--aaaaah!!!

NAME: Person_6
Now he's doing the Schilder technique.

NAME: Person_5
Oooh, he's using a Hedstrom file.

NAME: Person_7
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

NAME: Person_5
It's got a teardrop cross-section. Clearly a Hedstrom.

NAME: Person_7
No, no. K-Flex.

NAME: Person_5
Hedstrom!

NAME: Person_7
K-Flex!

NAME: Side_3
I'll go deflate him.

NAME: Side_1
All right, go ahead and rinse.

NAME: Person_7
Ugh! The human mouth is a disgusting place.

NAME: Person_6
Hey, Nigel.

NAME: Person_9
What did I miss? Am I late?

NAME: Person_6
Root canal and it's a doozy.

NAME: Person_9
Root canal, eh? What did he use to open?

NAME: Person_6
Gator-Glidden drill.

NAME: Person_9
He seems to be favoring that one. Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus...
hello.

NAME: Person_9
Who's this?

NAME: Side_3
New guy. Ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_7
The dentist took him off the reef.

NAME: Side_1
Hey! No, no,   no, no! They're not your fish. They're my fish. Come on, go! Go on, shoo! Oh,
the picture   broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece. She's going to be eight next week.
Hey, little   fella. Say hello to your new mummy. She'll be here Friday to pick you up. You're
her present.   Shh, shh, shh! It's our little secret. Well, Mr. Tucker, while that sets up
I'm going to   see a man about a wallaby.

NAME: Person_5
Oh, Darla.

NAME: Person_3
What? What's wrong with her?

NAME: Person_7
She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

NAME: Side_10
Poor Chuckles.

NAME: Side_3
He was her present last year.

NAME: Person_5
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

NAME: Person_6
She's a fish killer.

NAME: Person_3
I can't go with that girl! I have to get back to my dad! Aaah! Daddy! Help me!

NAME: Person_7
Oh, he's stuck!

NAME: Person_3
Can you help me?

NAME: Person_4
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

NAME: Person_6
Gill..

NAME: Person_4
I just wanna see him do it, okay? Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

NAME: Person_3
I can't. I have a bad fin.

NAME: Person_4
Never stopped me.

NAME: Person_4
Just think about what you need to do.

NAME: Person_5
Come on.

NAME: Person_4
Perfect.

NAME: Side_10
Yay!

NAME: Person_7
You did it!

NAME: Side_3
Good squirming! Ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_6
Wow. From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah.

NAME: Person_6
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

NAME: Person_4
I'm thinking, tonight, we give the kid a proper reception.

NAME: Person_5
So kid, you got a name or what?

NAME: Person_3
Nemo. I'm Nemo.

NAME: Person_2
Are you gonna eat that? Careful with that hammer...

NAME: Person_1
Huh? No, no! What does it say? Dory!

NAME: Person_2
Sea monkey has my money...

NAME: Person_1
Wake up! Get up! Come on! Come on!

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I'm a natural blue...

NAME: Person_2
Look out! Sharks eat fish! Aaaaaah!

NAME: Person_2
Wow. Dusty.

NAME: Person_1
It's gone. I've lost the mask.

NAME: Person_2
Did you drop it?

NAME: Person_1
You dropped it! That was my only chance of finding my son, now it's gone.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills. When life gets you down, you know what you gotta do?

NAME: Person_1
I don't wanna know what you gotta do when life gets you down.

NAME: Person_1
Dory, no singing.

NAME: Person_1
See, I'm going to get stuck now with that song now it's in my head!

NAME: Person_2
Sorry.

NAME: Person_1
Dory, do you see anything?

NAME: Person_2
Aaah! Something's got me!

NAME: Person_1
That was me. I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_1
Who could it be? It's me!

NAME: Person_2
Are..are you my conscience?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, yeah. I'm your conscience. We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

NAME: Person_2
Hmm, can't complain.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah? Good. Now, Dory. I want you to tell me..do you see anything?

NAME: Person_2
I see..I see a light.

NAME: Person_1
A light.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. Over there. Hey, conscience. Am I dead?

NAME: Person_1
No, I see it too. What is it?

NAME: Person_2
It's so pretty.

NAME: Person_1
I'm feeling...happy. Which is a big deal for me.

NAME: Person_2
I want to touch it. Oh!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna be your best friend...good feeling's gone.

NAME: Person_1
I can't see! I don't know where I'm going!

NAME: Person_2
Haah!

NAME: Person_1
The mask!

NAME: Person_2
What mask?

NAME: Person_2
Okay, I can't see a thing.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, gee!

NAME: Person_2
Hey, look! A mask!

NAME: Person_1
Read it!

NAME: Person_2
I'm sorry, but if you could just bring it a little closer, I kind of need the light.
That's great, keep it right there.

NAME: Person_1
Just read it!

NAME: Person_2
Okay, okay. Mr. Bossy. Uh, 'P'. Okay, 'P'. 'Shh-eer...Sher--P. Sher--P. Shirley? P.--'. Oh!
The first line's 'P. Sherman'!

NAME: Person_1
P. Sherman doesn't make any sense!

NAME: Person_2
Okay, second line. '42'.

NAME: Person_1
Don't eat me! Don't eat me! Aaaah!

NAME: Person_2
Light, please. 'Walla--Walla--Walla-beee'...

NAME: Person_1
Waah! Waaah! Waaaah!

NAME: Person_2
The second line's '42 Wallaby Way'!

NAME: Person_1
That's great! Speed read! Take a guess! No pressure! No problem! There's a lot of pressure!
Pressure! Take a guess now with pressure!

NAME: Person_2
'Sydney'. It's 'Sydney'!

NAME: Person_1
Duck!

NAME: Person_2
Aaah!

NAME: Person_1
I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I died, I'm dead.

NAME: Person_1
Dory.

NAME: Person_1
Dory! What did the mask say?

NAME: Person_1
Whoa, whoa, wait! Where is that?

NAME: Person_2
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered!

NAME: Person_1/Person_2
Aaah!

NAME: Person_2
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

NAME: Side_11
Psst. Nemo.

NAME: Person_3
Mmmm...

NAME: Side_11
Nemo.

NAME: Person_3
Huh?

NAME: Side_11
Suivez-moi. Follow me.

NAME: Person_4
State your name.

NAME: Person_3
Nemo.

NAME: Person_4
Brother Bloat, proceed.

NAME: Person_5
Nemo! Newcomer of orange and white, you have been called forth to the summit of Mount
Wannahockaloogie to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

NAME: Person_3
Huh?

NAME: Person_6
We want you in our club, kid.

NAME: Person_3
Really?

NAME: Side_10
Bubbles! Bubbles! Let me--oww!

NAME: Person_6
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy!

NAME: Person_4
From this moment on, you will now be known as Sharkbait.

NAME: Person_5/Side_10/Person_7
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

NAME: Person_4
Welcome, brother Sharkbait!

NAME: Person_5/Side_10/Person_7
Sharkbait! Ooh ha ha!

NAME: Person_4
Enough with the Sharkbait.

NAME: Person_7
Sharkbait! Ooh..ba-ba-doo.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, Sharkbait's one of us now, agreed?

NAME: Person_5/Side_10/Person_7
Agreed!

NAME: Person_4
We can't send him off to his death. Darla's coming in 5 days, so what are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're gonna do: we're gonna get him outta here. We're gonna help
him escape.

NAME: Person_3
Escape? Really?

NAME: Person_4
We're all gonna escape!

NAME: Person_7
Gill, please, not another one of your escape plans.

NAME: Side_3
Sorry, but they, they just, they never work.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah. Why should this be any different?

NAME: Person_4
'Cause we've got him.

NAME: Person_3
Me?

NAME: Person_4
You see that filter?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah?

NAME: Person_4
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing. What we need you to do is take
a pebble inside and jam the gears. You do that and this tank's gonna get filthier and
filthier by the minute. Pretty soon, the dentist'll have to clean the tank himself. And
when he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in the individual baggies, then we roll
ourselves down the counter, out of the window, off the awning, into the bushes, across the
street and into the harbor! It's foolproof! Who's with me?

NAME: Person_5
Aye!

NAME: Side_11
Aye!

NAME: Side_3
Aye!

NAME: Side_10
Aye!

NAME: Person_7
I think your nuts.

NAME: Person_7
No offense, kid, but, um..you're not the best swimmer.

NAME: Person_4
He's fine, he can do this. So Sharkbait, what do you think?

NAME: Person_3
Let's do it.

NAME: Person_2
I'm going to P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going? I'm going to P.
Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. If you're askin' where I'm goin'. I'll tell you that's
where I'm going. It's P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear
you. P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way...

NAME: Person_2
P. Sherman 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Why do I have to tell you over and over again? I'll tell
you again. I don't get tired of it--

NAME: Person_1
Okay, all right.

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
Here's the thing.

NAME: Person_1
Y'know, I just, I-I think it's best if I just, if I just, carry on from here by..by myself.

NAME: Person_2
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Y'know, alone.

NAME: Person_2
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_1
Without, without..well, I mean, not without you. I mean, it's just that I don't want you...
with me.

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
I don't wanna hurt your feelings..

NAME: Person_2
You want me to leave?

NAME: Person_1
Well, I mean not..yes, yeah. It's just that you know I-I just can't afford anymore delays
and you're one of those fish that cause delays. And sometimes it's a good thing. There's
a whole group of fish. They're..'delay fish'.

NAME: Person_1
No, of course I like you. It's because I like you I don't wanna be with you. It's a
complicated emotion. Oh, don't cry. I like you.

NAME: Side_7
Hey, you! Lady, is this guy botherin' you?

NAME: Person_2
Um, I don't remember. Were you?

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no, no, no. We're just, we're..hey, do you guys know how I can get to--

NAME: Side_7
Look, pal. We're talkin' to the lady, not you. Hey-hey, you like impressions?

NAME: Person_2
Mm-mmm-mmmm.

NAME: Side_7
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen. So, what are we? Take a guess.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, oh, I've seen one of those.

NAME: Side_7
I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

NAME: Person_2
Wait, wait, um..

NAME: Person_1
It's a swordfish.

NAME: Side_7
Hey, clown boy! Let the lady guess. Where's the butter?

NAME: Person_2
Oh-oh-oh! It's on the tip of my tongue.

NAME: Side_7
Saw that.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Side_7
Lots of legs, lives in the ocean.

NAME: Person_2
Clam!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, they're good.

NAME: Person_1
Will somebody please give me directions?

NAME: Person_2
Ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_1
I'm serious.

NAME: Side_7
Blah-blah-blah! Me-me-blah! Blah-blah-blah-blah-me-me-me!

NAME: Person_1
Thank you.

NAME: Person_2
Oh dear. Hey, hey come back! Hey, what's the matter?

NAME: Person_1
What's the matter? While they're doing their silly little impressions, I am miles from
home, with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

NAME: Person_2
Boy, bet that's frustrating.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Meanwhile my son is out there.

NAME: Person_2
You're son Chico?

NAME: Person_1
Nemo.

NAME: Person_2
Right. Got it.

NAME: Person_1
But it doesn't matter, 'cause no fish in this entire ocean is gonna help me.

NAME: Person_2
Well, I'm helping you. Wait right here. Hey, guys.

NAME: Side_7
What, is he bothering you again?

NAME: Person_2
No, no, he's a good guy. Go easy on him, he's lost his son, Fabio. Any of you heard of
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

NAME: Side_7
Sydney? Oh sure. Why, Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

NAME: MOONSide_24 Side_25
Sure do.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, hey! They know Sydney!

NAME: Person_2
You wouldn't know how to get there, would you?

NAME: Side_7
What you wanna do is follow the EAC, that's the East Australian Current. Big current,
can't miss it, it's in..that direction. And then you gotta follow that for about, I
don't know, what do you guys think? About three leagues? And that little baby's gonna
put you right past Sydney.

NAME: Person_1
Great! That's great! Dory, you did it!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, please. I'm just your little helper. Helping along, that's me.

NAME: Person_1
Well, listen fellas, thank you.

NAME: Side_7
Don't mention it. And, uh, loosen up. Okay, buddy?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, you guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

NAME: Side_7
Oh, hey ma'am, one more thing.

NAME: Person_2
Yes.

NAME: Side_7
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

NAME: Person_2
Trench, through it, not over it. I'll remember. Hey, hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, wait up, partner.
Hold on. Wait! Wait-wait! I got, I gotta tell you something..whoa. Nice trench. Hello!
Okay, let's go.

NAME: Person_1
Bad trench, bad trench. Come on, we're gonna swim over this thing.

NAME: Person_2
Whoa, whoa, partner. Little red flag goin' up. Somethin's telling me we should swim through
it, not over it.

NAME: Person_1
Are you even looking at this thing? It's got death written all over it.

NAME: Person_2
I'm sorry, but I really, really, really think we should swim through.

NAME: Person_1
And I'm really, really done talking about this. Over we go.

NAME: Person_2
Come on, trust me on this.

NAME: Person_1
Trust you?

NAME: Person_2
Yes, trust. It's what friends do.

NAME: Person_2
Okay.

Boy, sure is clear up here.

NAME: Person_1
Exactly. And look at that, there's the current. We should be there in no time.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, little guy.

NAME: Person_1
You wanted to go through the trench.

NAME: Person_1
Dory! That's a jellyfish!

NAME: Person_2
Bad Squishy! Bad Squishy!

NAME: Person_1
Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Get away! Come here, let me see.

NAME: Person_2
Don't touch it! Don't touch it!

NAME: Person_1
I'm not gonna touch it. I just wanna look.

NAME: Person_2
Heeey, how come it didn't sting you?

NAME: Person_1
It did. It's just that..

NAME: Person_2
Ow! Ow, oww!

NAME: Person_1
..hold still. I live in this anemone and I'm, I'm, I'm used to these kind of stings.
Come here.

NAME: Person_2
Ow, ow! Oww!

NAME: Person_1
It doesn't look bad, you're gonna be fine. But now we know, don't we?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1/Person_2
Aaaah!

NAME: Person_1
Don't move! This is bad, Dory.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, watch this! Boing! Boing!

NAME: Person_1
Dory! Don't bounce on the tops! They will..not sting you. The tops don't sting you,
that's it!

NAME: Person_2
Ooh! Two in a row, beat that.

NAME: Person_1
Dory! All right, listen to me. I have an idea, a game.

NAME: Person_2
A game?

NAME: Person_1
A game.

NAME: Person_2
A game?

NAME: Person_1
Yes.

NAME: Person_2
Aah! I love games! Pick me!

NAME: Person_1
All right, here's the game. Um, whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish, wins.

NAME: Person_2
Okay!

NAME: Person_1
Rules, rules, rules!

NAME: Person_2
Okay!

NAME: Person_1
You can't touch the tentacles, only the tops.

NAME: Person_2
Something about tentacles, got it. On your mark, get set, go!

NAME: Person_1
W-wait! Wait! Not something about them, it's all about them! Wait!

NAME: Person_2
Weeee!

NAME: Person_1
Dory!

NAME: Person_2
Gotta go faster if you wanna win!

NAME: Person_2
Boing! Boing! Boing-boing-boing-boing!

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute--whoa! Dory!

NAME: Person_2
Weeee!

NAME: Person_1
So, we're cheating death now. That's what we're doin'. We're havin' fun at the same time.
I can do this, just be careful.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, careful I don't make you cry when I win!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, I don't think so!

NAME: Person_2
Ha ha ha ha! Whooo! Give it up, old man. You can't fight evolution, I was built for speed.

NAME: Person_1
The question is, Dory, are you hungry?

NAME: Person_2
Huh? Hungry?

NAME: Person_2
Ugh...am I disqualified?

NAME: Person_1
No, you're doing fine! You're, you're actually winning! But you gotta stay awake. Uh, where
does P. Sherman live?

NAME: Person_2
P..Sherman..Wallaby Way...Sydney...

NAME: Person_1
That's it! Oww! Ow! Stay awake! Stay awake! Ow! Stay awake! Stay--awake!

NAME: Person_4
You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah.

NAME: Person_4
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's lookin' for you.

NAME: Person_3
He's not looking for me. He's scared of the ocean.

NAME: Person_4
Peach, any movement?

NAME: Person_6
He's had at least four cups of coffee, it's gotta be soon.

NAME: Person_4
Keep on him.

NAME: Person_4
My first escape, landed on dental tools. I was aimin' for the toilet.

NAME: Person_3
Toilet?

NAME: Person_4
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

NAME: Person_3
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

NAME: Person_4
Aah, I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to 'ya.

NAME: Side_10
Bubbles! Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles---

NAME: Person_6
Potty break! Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest! We have 4.2 minutes.

NAME: Person_4
That's your cue, Sharkbait.

NAME: Person_5
You can do it, kid.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, you gotta be quick. Once you get in, you swim down to the bottom of the chamber
and I'll talk you through the rest.

NAME: Person_3
Okay.

NAME: Person_4
Go on, it'll be a piece of kelp.

NAME: Person_4
Nicely done! Can you hear me?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah.

NAME: Person_4
Here comes the pebble. Now, do you see a small opening?

NAME: Person_3
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, inside it you'll see a rotating fan. Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the
fan to stop it turning.

NAME: Person_3
Aaah!

NAME: Person_4
Careful, Sharkbait.

NAME: Person_3
I can't do it!

NAME: Person_6
Gill, this isn't a good idea.

NAME: Person_4
He'll be fine. Try again.

NAME: Person_3
Okay.

NAME: Person_4
That's it, Sharkbait. Nice and steady.

NAME: Person_3
I got it! I got it!

NAME: Person_5
He did it!

NAME: Person_7
Whew!

NAME: Person_4
That's great, kid! Now, swim up the tube and out.

NAME: Person_3
Oh no! Gill! Gill!

NAME: Person_4
Sharkbait!

NAME: Person_5
Oh my gosh!

NAME: Person_4
Get 'im outta there! Get 'im outta there!

NAME: Side_10
Help him!

NAME: Person_7
What do we do!? What do we do!?

NAME: Person_6
Oh no!

NAME: Person_4
Stay calm, kid! Just don't panic!

NAME: Person_3
Help me!

NAME: Person_4
Sharkbait! Grab hold of this!

NAME: Person_3
No! No!

NAME: Person_4
Feed me more!

NAME: Person_7
That's it!

NAME: Person_4
Come on, Sharkbait! Grab it!

NAME: Person_3
I got it!

NAME: Person_4
Pull!

NAME: Person_6

NAME: Person_4
No. We're done.

You so totally rock, Squirt! So give me some fin..noggin..

NAME: Side_2/Side_12

NAME: Side_2
Oh, intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

NAME: Side_12
Jellies? Sweet.

NAME: Side_2
Totally.

NAME: Person_1
Well, apparently, I must've done something you all like. Heh, uh, dudes.

NAME: Side_12
You rock, dude.

NAME: Person_1
Ow.

NAME: Side_2
Curl away, my son. Aw, it's awesome, Jellyman. Little dudes are just eggs, leave 'em
on the beach to hatch, then coo-coo-ca-choo, they find their way back to the big 'ol blue.

NAME: Person_1
All by themselves?

NAME: Side_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
But-but-but dude, how do you know when they're ready?

NAME: Side_2
Well, you never really know. But when they'll know, you'll know, you know? Ha.

NAME: Person_2
Hey! Look, everybody!

NAME: Side_12
I know that dude. It's the Jellyman.

NAME: Person_2
Well, go on, jump on him.

NAME: Side_28
Turtle pile!

NAME: Person_1
W-w-wai-wait--

NAME: Side_52
Are you funny?

NAME: Side_53
Where's your shell?

NAME: Person_1
Hold on, I need to breath--

NAME: Side_54
Are you running away?

NAME: Side_55
Did you really cross the jellyfish forest?

NAME: Side_56
Did they sting you?

NAME: Person_1
One at a time!

NAME: Side_57
Mr. Fish, did you die?

NAME: Person_2
Sorry. I was a little vague on the details.

NAME: Side_12
So where are you going?

NAME: Person_1
Well, you see my son was taken. My son was taken away from me.

NAME: Person_2
No way.

NAME: Side_12
What happened?

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no, kids. I don't wanna talk about it.

NAME: Side_28
Awww! Please?

NAME: Side_12
Pleeeease?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, boy. This is gonna be good, I can tell.

NAME: Person_1
And my son,   Nemo, see he was mad at me. And maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been
so tough on   him, I don't know. Anyway, he swam out in the open water to this boat and when
he was out   there, these divers appeared and I tried to stop them but the boat was too fast.
So we swam   out in the ocean to follow them...

NAME: Side_58
They couldn't stop them. And then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean and they bump into..

NAME: SMSide_18 Side_24
..three ferocious sharks! He scares away the sharks by blowin' them up!

NAME: BIG Side_24
Golly, that's amazing!

NAME: SMSide_18 Side_24
And then dives thousands of..

NAME: Side_60
..feet straight down into the dark. It's like wicked dark down there, you can see a thing.
How's it goin', Bob? And the only thing that they can see down there..

NAME: SWORDSide_24
..is the light from this big horrible creature with razor sharp teeth. Nice parry, old man.
And then he has to blast his way...

NAME: Side_62
So, these two little fish have been..searching the ocean for days. On the East Australian
Current.

NAME: Side_63
Which means that he may be on his way here right now. That should put them in Sydney..

NAME: Side_64
..Harbor in a matter of days. I mean, it sounds like this guy's gonna stop at..

NAME: Side_65
..nothing until he finds his son. I sure hope he makes it.

NAME: Side_66
That's one dedicated father if you ask me.

NAME: Side_15
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NAME: Person_9
Oh, would you just shut up! You're rats with wings!

NAME: Side_17
..bloke's been lookin' for his boy Nemo.

NAME: Person_9
Nemo?

NAME: Side_17
He was taken off the reef by divers and this..

NAME: Person_9
There, take it! You happy!

NAME: Side_15
Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

NAME: Person_9
Hey, hey, hey! Say that again! You said something about Nemo. What was it?

NAME: Side_15
Mine! Mine! Mine!

NAME: Side_36
Whooooooaaa..watcha!

NAME: Side_29
Mine!

NAME: Side_17
Last I heard, he's headin' towards the harbor.

NAME: Person_9
Ho ho! Brilliant!

NAME: Side_3
Is he doing okay?

NAME: Person_7
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D-A-R..

NAME: Person_3
It's okay, I know who you're talking about.

NAME: Person_3
Gill? Gill?

NAME: Person_4
Hey, Sharkbait.

NAME: Person_3
I'm sorry I couldn't stop the--

NAME: Person_4
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that
ocean. I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there. Nothing should be worth that.
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

NAME: Person_9
All right! Hey, hey, hey, hey--!

NAME: Side_1
What the!?

NAME: Side_27
AAAAAAAAAH!!! Oooooh...

NAME: Side_1
Well, uh, that's one way to pull a tooth. He he he he he! Huh, darn kids. Well, good
thing I pulled the right one, eh, prime minister? He he he he!

NAME: Person_9
Hey, hey. Psst!

NAME: Person_6
Oh, Nigel. You just missed an extraction.

NAME: Person_9
Ooh! Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet--oh, what I'm talkin' about!? Nemo!
Where's Nemo? I gotta speak with him.

NAME: Person_3
What? What is it?

NAME: Person_9
Your dad's been fighting the entire ocean looking for you.

NAME: Person_3
My father? Really?

NAME: Person_4
Really?

NAME: Person_9
Oh yeah. He's travelled hundreds of miles. He's been battling sharks and jellyfish and
all sorts of--

NAME: Person_3
Sharks? That can't be him.

NAME: Person_9
Are you sure? What was his name? Some sort of sportfish or something: tuna, uh, trout..

NAME: Person_3
Marlin?

NAME: Person_9
That's it! Marlin! The little clownfish from the reef.

NAME: Person_3
It's my dad! He took on a shark!

NAME: Person_9
I heard he took on three.

NAME: Side_3/Person_5/Person_7
Three!?

NAME: Person_4
Three sharks!?

NAME: Person_5
That's gotta be forty eight hundred teeth!

NAME: Person_9
You see, kid, after you were taken by diver Dan over there, your dad followed the boat
you were on like a maniac.

NAME: Person_3
Really?

NAME: Person_9
He's swimming and   he's swimming and he's giving it all he's got and then three gigantic
sharks capture him   and he blows them up! And then dives thousands of feet and gets chased
by a monster with   huge teeth! He ties this demon to a rock and what does he get for a
reward? He gets to   battle an entire jellyfish forest! And now he's riding with a bunch
of sea turtles on   the East Australian Current and the word is he's headed this way right
now, to Sydney!

NAME: Person_5
Wow! Ha ha ha!

NAME: Side_3
Oh, what a good daddy!

NAME: Person_4
He was lookin' for you after all, Sharkbait.

NAME: Person_7
He's swimming to the filter!

NAME: Person_5
Not again!

NAME: Person_4
Sharkbait!

NAME: Side_3
No!

NAME: Person_7
You've got your whole life ahead of you!

NAME: Person_5
Oh no!

NAME: Person_4
We'll help you, kid!

NAME: Person_5
Gotta get him out!

NAME: Side_3
Gimme that thing!

NAME: Side_3
Get him outta there!

NAME: Person_7
Come on, kid! Grab the end!

NAME: Side_3
Sharkbait!

NAME: Person_5
Sharkbait! Are you okay!?

NAME: Person_7
No!

NAME: Person_4
Can you hear me, Sharkbait!? Nemo! Can you hear me!?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, I can hear you.

NAME: Person_4
Sharkbait, you did it!

NAME: Person_7
Sharkbait, you're--covered with germs! Aaaaaaah!!!

NAME: Person_4
That took guts, kid.

NAME: Side_11
Oui!

NAME: Person_4
No cleaning.

NAME: Side_11
I shall resist.

NAME: Person_4
Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts. We're gonna make this tank
so filthy, the dentist'll have to clean it.

NAME: Person_4
Good work.

NAME: Person_3
Ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Side_2
All right, we're here, dudes! Get ready! Your exit's comin' up, man!

NAME: Person_1
Where!? I don't see it!

NAME: Person_2
Right there! I see it! I see it!

NAME: Person_1
You mean the swirling vortex of terror!?

NAME: Side_2
That's it, dude!

NAME: Person_1
Of course it is.

NAME: Side_2
Okay, first: find your exit buddy!

NAME: Side_2
Do you have your exit buddy?

NAME: Person_2
Yes!

NAME: Side_2
Okay, Squirt here will now give you a rundown of proper exiting technique!

NAME: Side_12
Good afternoon, we're gonna have a great jump today! Okay, crank a hard cutback as you hit
the wall! There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out! Remember: rip it, roll it and
punch it!

NAME: Person_1
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it! You know, you're really cute! But I don't
know what you're saying! Say the first thing again!

NAME: Side_2
Okay, Jellyman! Go, go, go, go, go, go!

NAME: Person_1/Person_2
Aaaaaaaaaah!!! Weeeeeeeeeeee!!! Whoooooooooooaaaaa!!! Aaaaaaaaaaah!!! Woohoooo!!!
Whoooooaaa!!!

NAME: Person_2
Whoooo!

NAME: Person_2
Hey, look! Turtles!

NAME: Side_2
Ha ha! Most excellent! Now, turn your fishy tails 'round and swim straight on through
to Sydney! No worries, man!

NAME: Person_1
No worries! Thank you, dude Crush!

NAME: Side_28
Bye! Bye, Jellyman!

NAME: Side_2
You tell your little dude I said 'hi', okay?

NAME: Side_12
See you later, dudes!

NAME: Person_2
Bye, everyone!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, Nemo would've loved this. Hey, ooh! Hey, Crush! Crush, I forgot! How old are you?

NAME: Side_2
Hundred and fifty, dude! And still young! Rock on!

NAME: Person_1
Hundred and fifty! Hundred and fifty, I gotta remember that.

NAME: Person_2
Whoa. We goin' in there?

NAME: Person_1
Yup.

NAME: Person_2
P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

NAME: Person_1
Yup. We're gonna just swim straight.

NAME: Person_1
Dory?

NAME: Person_1
Boy, this is taking a while.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, how about we play a game?

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_2
Uh, okay. I'm thinking of something, uh, orange. And it's small..

NAME: Person_1
It's me.

NAME: Person_2
Right. Okay..

NAME: Person_2
..orange, and uh, small..

NAME: Person_1
It's me.

NAME: Person_2
All righty, Mr. Smarty Pants.

NAME: Person_2
..orange and small, and white stripes..

NAME: Person_1
Me. And the next one's just a guess: me.

NAME: Person_2
Okay, that's just scary.

NAME: Person_1
W-w-wait, I have definitely seen this floating speck before. That means we've passed it
before and that means we're going in circles and that means we're not going straight!

NAME: Person_2
Hey. Hey!

NAME: Person_1
We gotta get to the surface, come on! Let's figure it out up there. Let's go! Follow me!
Wha--?

NAME: Person_2
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Relax. Take a deep breath. Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, fine. Who do you wanna ask, the speck? There's nobody here!

NAME: Person_1
Dory! Dory! Dory! Okay, now it's my turn. I'm thinking of something dark and mysterious.
It's a fish we don't know. And if we ask it directions, it could ingest us and spit out
our bones!

NAME: Person_2
What is it with men and asking for directions?

NAME: Person_1
Look, I don't wanna play the gender card right now. You wanna play a card? Let's play the
'Let's Not Die' card.

NAME: Person_2
You wanna get outta here, don't you?

NAME: Person_1
Of course, I do.

NAME: Person_2
Well then, how are we gonna do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best? Hmmm?
Hmmmm!? Come on, trust me on this.

NAME: Person_1
All right.

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me! Woohoo! Little fella? Hello. Don't be rude, say 'hi'.

NAME: Person_1
Ha..hello.

NAME: Person_2
His son Bingo..

NAME: Person_1
Nemo.

NAME: Person_2
..Nemo, was taken to, uh..

NAME: Person_1
Sydney.

NAME: Person_1
Dory, I'm a little fella. I don't think that's a little fella.

NAME: Person_2
Oh. Oh, oh, big fella. Big fe--whale. Okay. Maybe he only speaks whale.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, Dory..what're you doing?

NAME: Person_1
What're you doing?

NAME: Person_1
Are you sure you speak whale?

NAME: Person_1
Dory! Heaven knows what you're saying! See, he's swimming away.

NAME: Person_1
He's not coming back. You offended him.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe a different dialect. MOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! MOOOOOAAAAAAAAAA..!

NAME: Person_1
Dory. Dory, this is not whale. You're speaking like..upset stomach.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe I should try humpback.

NAME: Person_1
No, don't try humpback.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, you actually sound sick.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe louder, huh? RAAAH!!! RAAAAH!!!

NAME: Person_1
Don't do that!

NAME: Person_2
Too much orca. Didn't it sound a little orca-ish?

NAME: Person_1
It doesn't sound orca! It sounds like nothing I've ever heard!

NAME: Person_1
It's just as well, he might be hungry.

NAME: Person_2
Don't worry. Whales don't eat clownfish, they eat krill.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, look. Krill.

NAME: Person_1
Move, Dory! Move!

NAME: Person_2
Aah-aaah! Aaaaaaaaaah!

NAME: Person_4
Look at that. Would you look at that? Filthy. Absolutely filthy. And it's all thanks to
you, kid. You made it possible. Jacques, I said no cleaning!

NAME: Side_11
I am ashamed.

NAME: Person_6
Hey, look. Scum angel.

NAME: Person_7
Aah! Aaaah! Ooh-ooh! Aaaaah!

NAME: Side_3
Flo! Flo! Has anybody seen Flo? Flo!

NAME: Person_6
Nine o' clock and cue dentist.

NAME: Side_1
Hello, Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

NAME: Person_6
Okay. Okay, here we go. Here we go, okay.

NAME: Side_1
Little Davey Reynolds.

NAME: Person_6
Okay. Walks to the counter, drops the keys..

NAME: Person_7
Bloat, that's disgusting!

NAME: Person_7
Eww! Don't you people realize we are swimming in our own--

NAME: Person_6
Shhh! Here he comes.

NAME: Side_1
Crikey, what a state. Oh. Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

NAME: Side_21
Uh, ten 'o clock, luv.

NAME: Side_1
Leave it open, would you? I gotta clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

NAME: Person_4
He he! Did you hear that, Sharkbait?

NAME: Person_3
Yay! He's gonna clean the tank! He's gonna clean the tank! We're gonna be clean!

NAME: Person_4
Are you ready to see your dad, kid?

NAME: Person_3
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_4
Of course you are. Y'know, I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbor
waitin' for you right now.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Ooof!

NAME: Person_2
Ha~~haaa~~haaaaaaah! Whooo!

NAME: Person_1
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

NAME: Person_2
Here comes a big one--whooooooo! Come on, you gotta try this!

NAME: Person_1
Would you just stop it!?

NAME: Person_2
Why? What's wrong?

NAME: Person_1
We're in a whale! Don't you get it!?

NAME: Person_2
A whale?

NAME: Person_1
A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here!

NAME: Person_2
Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale.

NAME: Person_2
Woo-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-hoo! Hey. You okay?

NAME: Person_2
There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay.

NAME: Person_1
No. No, it won't.

NAME: Person_2
Sure it will, you'll see.

NAME: Person_1
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

NAME: Person_2
Huh. That's a funny thing to promise.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him.
Not much fun for little Harpo.

NAME: Person_2
Hmm..

NAME: Person_1
What's going on?

NAME: Person_2
I don't know. I'll ask him. MMMWWHAAAAAAAAA! HUUUWHAAAAAAAAA..

NAME: Person_1
Dory. Dory.

NAME: Person_1
Dory.

NAME: Person_2
I think he says we've stopped.

NAME: Person_2
Really? You sure about that?

NAME: Person_1
Look, it's already half-empty!

NAME: Person_2
Hmm..I'd say it's half full.

NAME: Person_1
Stop that! It's half-empty!

NAME: Person_2
Okay, that one was a little tougher. He either said we should go to the back of the throat
or he wants a root beer float.

NAME: Person_1
Of course he wants us to go there! That's eating us! How do I taste, Moby!? Huh!?
Do I taste good!? You tell him I'm not interested in being lunch!

NAME: Person_2
Okay. HEEEEEEEEE--

NAME: Person_1
Stop talking to him--waaaah!

NAME: Person_2
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!!

NAME: Person_1
What is going on!?

NAME: Person_2
I'll check! WHAAAAAAA--!

NAME: Person_1
No! No more whale! You can't speak whale!

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I can!

NAME: Person_1
No, you can't! You think you could do these things but you can't, Nemo!

NAME: Person_2
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Dory!

NAME: Person_2
He says it's time to let go! Everything's gonna be all right!

NAME: Person_2
I don't!

NAME: Person_1
Ha ha ha! We're alive!

NAME: Person_2
Look! Sy-d-ney..Sydney! Uh, Sydney! Sydney again!

NAME: Person_1
You were right, Dory! We made it! We're gonna find my son!

NAME: Person_2
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. All we gotta do is find the boat that took him.

NAME: Person_2
Right!

NAME: Person_1
Come on, Dory. We can do this!

NAME: Side_3
But how?

NAME: Person_4
Boss must've installed it last night while we were sleepin'.

NAME: Person_3
What're we gonna do?

NAME: Person_4
What's it say, Peach?

NAME: Person_4
I can't hear you, Peach.

NAME: Person_6
'The AquaScum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning maintenance free salt water purifier
that is guaranteed to even extend the life of your aquarium fish'.

NAME: Person_6
'The AquaScum is programmed to scan your tank environment every 5 minutes'?

NAME: Person_7
Scan? What does that mean?

NAME: Person_7
Aaah!

NAME: Side_68
Temperature: 82 degrees. PH balance: normal.

NAME: Side_18
Oooooh.

NAME: Person_6
Nice.

NAME: Person_7
Ooh..ah..curse you, AquaScum!

NAME: Person_5
That's it for the escape plan. It's ruined!

NAME: Person_3
Then what're we gonna do about--

NAME: Person_4
Stay down, kid!

NAME: Person_5
False alarm.

NAME: Person_7
My nerves can't take much more of this.

NAME: Person_5
What're we gonna do when that little brat gets here?

NAME: Person_4
I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'.

NAME: Person_3
Aaah! Oh! Gill!

NAME: Person_3
Help me! Help me!

NAME: Person_4
Hold on! I'm comin'!

NAME: Person_3
Help me!

NAME: Person_4
Swim down! Come on, kid! Swim down! Come on!

NAME: Person_5
Everybody jump in!

NAME: Side_3
Swim down!

NAME: Person_4

NAME: Person_3

NAME: Person_5
Sharkbait!

NAME: Side_1
Whoops. That would've been a nasty fall.

NAME: Person_3
Gill! Don't let me go belly up!

NAME: Person_4
Just calm down, Nemo.

NAME: Person_3
Don't let me go belly up!

NAME: Person_4
You won't go belly up, I promise. You're gonna be okay.

NAME: Person_2
All right, do any of these boats look familiar to you?

NAME: Person_1
No, but the boat has to be here somewhere! Come on, Dory, we're gonna find it.

NAME: Person_1
Dory, wake up, wake up. Come on.

NAME: Person_1
That's not a duck. It's a--pelican! Whooooaaaaah!

NAME: Person_2
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

NAME: Person_1
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast!

NAME: Side_17
Hey, hey, Nigel. Heh, would you look at that?

NAME: Person_9
I got something to tell 'ya!

NAME: Side_29
Mine.

NAME: Person_9
Okay, don't make any sudden moves. Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

NAME: Person_1
Hop in your mouth, huh? And how does that make me live?

NAME: Side_29
Mine.

NAME: Person_9
Because I can take you to your son.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, right.

NAME: Person_9
No. I know your son. He's orange, he's got a gimpy fin on one side..

That's Nemo!

Darla, you're uncle will see you now.

NAME: Side_1
All right, let's see those pearly whites.

NAME: Side_9
RAAAH! I'm a piranha. They're in the Amazon.

NAME: Side_1
And a piranha's a fish, just like your present.

NAME: Side_1
Oh no. Poor little guy.

He's dead!

NAME: Person_4
Sharkbait!

NAME: Side_9
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

NAME: Side_1
He he he! Must've left your present in the car, sweetie. Ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Side_9
Awwwww.

NAME: Side_1
I'll go and get it.

NAME: Person_6
He's not dead!

NAME: Person_5
What's happening? Why is he playing dead?

NAME: Person_4
He's gonna get flushed down the toilet! He's gonna get outta here!

NAME: Side_3
Yay!

NAME: Person_5
He's gonna get flushed!

NAME: Person_7
What a smart little guy!

NAME: Person_4
Oh no, not the trash can!

Hey! Hey! I found his dad!

Where's Nemo!? Where is he!?

Fishy? Fishy! Wake up! Wake up!

Fish in my hair! Aaaaaaaah!

Sharkbait. Tell your dad..I said..hi. Go get 'em.

NAME: Person_5
He did it! Ha ha!

NAME: Side_3
Yay!

NAME: Side_10
I'm so happy!

NAME: Person_7
Is he gonna be okay, Gill?

NAME: Person_4
Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

NAME: Side_9
Fishy!

NAME: Person_3
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah! Daddy!

NAME: Person_9
I'm, I'm so sorry. Truly, I am.

NAME: Person_2
Hey..

NAME: Person_1
Dory. If it wasn't for you, I never even would have made it here. So, thank you.

NAME: Person_2
Hey! Hey, wait a minute. W-w-wait! Where are you going?

NAME: Person_1
It's over, Dory. We were too late. Nemo's gone and I'm going home now.

NAME: Person_2
No..no, you can't! Stop! Please don't go away. Please? No  one's ever stuck with me for
so long before. And if you leave, if you leave...I just,  I remember things better with you.
I do. Look, P. Sherman, 42..40..2..agh! I remember it, I  do. It's there, I know it is
because when I look at you, I can feel it. And I, I look  at you and...I'm home. Please.
I don't want them to go away. I don't wanna forget.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, Dory, but I do.

NAME: Side_30
Manna from heavens!

Sweet nectar of life!

I don't know where I am! I don't know what's going on, I think I lost somebody but I,
I can't remember.

It's okay, it's okay. I'm looking for someone too. Hey, we can look together.

Hey! Have you seen an orange fish swim by? It looks just like him!

NAME: Person_3
But bigger!

NAME: Side_23
Yeah, I saw 'im, bluey! But I'm not tellin' you where he went. And there's no way you're
gonna make me!

NAME: Side_29
Mine.

NAME: Side_36
Huh!? Aaaah! All right! I'll talk! I'll talk! He went to the fishing grounds! Aaaaah!

NAME: Side_15
Mine!Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!

Hey! Look out!

Dad!

NAME: Person_1
Nemo!

NAME: Person_3
Dad!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, thank goodness! It's all right, son. It's gonna be okay.

Dad! I know what to do!

NAME: Person_1
Nemo! No!

NAME: Person_3
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together!

NAME: Person_1
Get out of there, now!

NAME: Person_3
I know this will work!

NAME: Person_1
No, I am not gonna lose you again!

NAME: Person_3
Dad, there's no time! It's the only way we can save Dory! I can do this!

NAME: Person_1
You're right. I know you can.

NAME: Person_3
Lucky fin!

Now go! Hurry!

Nemo? Nemo? It's okay. Daddy's here, daddy's got you.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, thank goodness.

NAME: Person_3
Dad...I don't hate you.

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no. I'm so sorry, Nemo.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, guess what?

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_1
Sea turtles? I met one! And he was a hundred and fifty years old.

NAME: Person_3
Hundred and fifty?

NAME: Person_1
Yep.

NAME: Person_3
'Cause Sandy Plankton said they only live to be a hundred.

NAME: Person_1
Sandy Plankton? Do you think I would cross the entire ocean and not know as much as
Sandy Plankton!?

NAME: Person_3
Ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_1
He was a hundred and fifty! Not one hundred! Who is this Sandy Plankton who knows everything?

NAME: Person_1
Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go! Go!

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna win!

NAME: Person_3
No, you're not! I did it! Woohoo! Ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_1
Oh! My own son beats me!

NAME: Side_4
Climb aboard, explorers!

NAME: Person_1
So just then, the sea cucumber looks over to the mollusk and says : 'with fronds like these,
who needs anemones?'!

NAME: Side_13/Side_25/Side_26
Haaa-ha ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Side_4
Well, hello, Nemo! Who's this?

NAME: Person_3
Exchange student.

NAME: Side_12
I'm from the EAC, dude!

NAME: Side_4
Sweet.

NAME: Person_3/Side_12
Totally.

NAME: Side_13
But seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did?

NAME: Person_8
Uh, pardon me.

NAME: Person_8
Hello.

NAME: Side_25
Ohh!

NAME: Person_8
Don't be alarmed.

NAME: Side_8
Oh, we just wanna make sure that our newest member got home safe.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks, guys.

NAME: Person_8
Well, we'll see you next week.

NAME: Side_5
Keep up with the program, Dory.

NAME: Side_8
Remember: fish are friends..

NAME: Person_2
..not food! Bye!

NAME: Side_4
Hold on! Here we go! Next up, knowledge!

NAME: Person_1
Bye, son! Have fun!

NAME: Person_3
Bye, dad! Oh! Oh, Mr. Ray! Wait. I forgot something.

NAME: Person_3
Love you, dad.

NAME: Person_1
I love you too, son.

NAME: Person_3
Uh, dad, you can let go now.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry! Now go have an adventure!

NAME: Side_12
Goodbye! See you later, dudes!

NAME: Person_2
Bye, Elmo!

NAME: Person_1
Nemo.

NAME: Person_3
See you after school, Dory! Bye, dad!

NAME: Person_1
Bye, son.

NAME: Side_1
Barbara?

NAME: Side_21
Uh-huh?

NAME: Side_1
I don't understand it. Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks! Had to clean
the tank myself, take all the fish out, put 'em in bags and---where'd the fish go?

NAME: Person_4
Come on, Peach!

NAME: Side_3
Hurry!

NAME: Person_4
You can do it!

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, that's it! You can do it!

NAME: Person_7
Just a little further!

NAME: Person_6
That's the shortest red light I've ever seen!

NAME: Person_5
Come on, Peach!

NAME: Person_6
Oooh--aaaaah!

NAME: Side_18
Yay! We did it! Ha ha ha ha ha!

NAME: Person_5
Now what?

NAME: Side_17
This is Agent Leland Turbo. I have
a flash transmission for Agent Finn
McMissile.

NAME: Side_17
Finn. My cover's been compromised.
Everything's gone pear-shaped.

NAME: Side_17
You won't believe what I've found
out here.

NAME: Side_17
This is bigger than anything we've
ever seen. And no one even knows it
exists. Finn, I need backup. But
don't call the cavalry - it could
blow the operation. And be careful.
It's not safe out here!

NAME: Side_17
Transmitting my grids now. Good
luck!

NAME: Side_12
Alright buddy, we're here. Right
where you paid me to bring you.
Question is, why?

NAME: Person_3
I'm looking for a car.

NAME: Side_12
A car? Hey pal, you can't get any
further away from land than out
here.

NAME: Person_3
Exactly where I want to be.

NAME: Side_12
Well I got news for you, buddy.
There's nobody out here but us.

NAME: Side_21
What are you doing out here?

NAME: Side_12
What does it look like, genius? I'm
crabbing!

NAME: Side_21
Well turn around and go back where
you came from.

NAME: Side_12
Yeah? And who's gonna make me?

NAME: Side_12
Alright, alright! Don't get your
prop in a twist.
What a jerk. Sorry, buddy. Looks
like it's the end of the line.
Buddy?

NAME: Person_6
Too many cars here. Out of my way!

NAME: Person_3
Professor Zundapp?

NAME: NOSY PPerson_8
You wanted to see this before we
load it?

NAME: Person_6
Ah, yes. Very carefully...

NAME: NOSY PPerson_8
Oh. A TV camera. What does it
actually do?

NAME: Person_6
This camera is extremely dangerous.

NAME: Person_6
This is valuable equipment. Make
sure it is properly secured for the
voyage.

NAME: NOSY PPerson_8
You got it.

NAME: Person_7
This is one of those British spies
we told you about.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah. This one we caught sticking
his bumper where it didn't belong.

NAME: Person_6
Agent Leland Turbo.

NAME: Person_6
It's Finn McMissile! He's seen the
camera! Kill him!!

NAME: Person_8
He's getting away!

NAME: Side_21
Not for long.

NAME: Person_6
Wunderbar. With Finn McMissile
gone, who can stop us now?

NAME: Person_1
Mater. Tow Mater, that's who... is
here to help you!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Otis!

NAME: Side_7
Hey, Mater. Gosh, I'm so sorry. I
thought I could make it this time,
but...
(he tries to start his
engine, stalls)
Smooth like pudding, huh? Ah, who
am I kidding? I'll always be a
lemon.

NAME: Person_1
Well dadgum, you're leaking oil
again. Must be your gaskets. Hey,
look on the bright side: This is
your tenth tow this month, so that
means it's on the house.

NAME: Side_7
You're the only one that's nice to
lemons like me, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
Don't sweat it. These things happen
to everybody, Otis.

NAME: Side_7
But you never leak oil.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't
tell nobody, but I think my rust is
starting to show through.

NAME: Side_7
Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet?

NAME: Person_1
Not yet.

NAME: Side_7
He must be crazy-excited about
winning his fourth Piston Cup.
Four! Wow!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him.
But I sure wish he'd hurry up and
get back `cause we got a whole
summer's worth of best friend fun
to make up for. Just me and --

NAME: Person_1
--- McQueen!

NAME: Side_7
Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You
don't need to go so fast!

NAME: Side_2
Oh, Lightning. Welcome home.

NAME: Side_18
Good to have you back, honey.

NAME: Side_11
Congratulations, man.

NAME: Side_10
Welcome home, soldier.

NAME: Side_27
The place wasn't the same without
you, son.

NAME: Side_33
What? Did he go somewhere?

NAME: Person_2
It's good to be home, everybody.

NAME: Person_2
Mater!

NAME: Person_1
McQueen!

NAME: Side_7
Woaahhhhh!

NAME: Side_22
Hey. How far'd you make it this
time, Otis?

NAME: Side_7
Halfway to the county line.

NAME: Side_22
Not bad, man.

NAME: Side_7
I know, I can't believe it either!

NAME: Person_1
McQueen, welcome back!

NAME: Person_2
Mater, it's so good to see you.

NAME: Person_1
You too, buddy.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe
the things I got planned for us.

NAME: Side_34
These best friend greetings get
longer every year.

NAME: Person_2
Well, actually I've got something
to show you first.

NAME: Person_1
Wow. I can't believe they renamed
the Piston Cup after our very own
Doc Hudson.

NAME: Person_2
I know Doc said these things were
just old cups, but to have someone
else win it just didn't feel right,
you know?

NAME: Person_1
Well, Doc would've been real proud
of you. That's for sure.

NAME: Person_2
Alright, pal. I've been waiting all
summer for this. What've you got
planned?

NAME: Person_1
You sure you can handle it?

NAME: Person_2
Come on, you know who you're
talking to? This is Lightning
McQueen. I can handle anything.

NAME: Person_2
Uh.... Mater?!

NAME: Person_1
Just remember, your brakes ain't
gonna work on these!

NAME: Person_2
Come on, come on! Faster, faster!

NAME: Person_1
This is gonna be good!

NAME: Person_1
Uh-oh. This ain't gonna be good.

NAME: Person_1
Boy, this was the best day ever!
And my favorite souvenir?

NAME: Person_1
This new dent!

NAME: Person_2
Boy, Mater. Today was, uh...

NAME: Person_1
Shoot, that was nothing. Wait til
you see what I got planned for
tonight.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, Mater. Whoa. I was kind of
thinking of just a quiet dinner.

NAME: Person_1
That's exactly what I was thinking.

NAME: Person_2
No, I... I meant with Sally, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
Even better! You, me and Miss Sally
going out for supper.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, I meant it would be just me
and Sally.

NAME: Person_1
Oh.

NAME: Person_2
It's just for tonight. We'll do
whatever you want tomorrow.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks for understanding.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, sure. Y'all go on and have
fun now.

NAME: Person_2
Alright, then. See ya soon, amigo!

NAME: Side_3
This is so nice.

NAME: Person_2
I can't tell you how good it is to
be here alone. Just the two of us.
Finally, you and me ---

NAME: Person_1
My name is Mater and I'll be your
waiter.
Mater the waiter. That's funny
right there.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, you work here?

NAME: Person_1
Well yeah I work here. What'd you
think, I just snuck in here when
nobody was looking and pretended to
be your waiter, just so I could
hang out with you?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, yeah. How ridiculous would that
be?

NAME: Person_1
Now, can I start you two lovebirds
off with a couple drinks?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. I'll have my usual.

NAME: Side_3
You know what? I'm going to have
that too.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, right. Your usual.

NAME: Person_1
Guido! What's McQueen's usual?

NAME: Side_28
How should I know?

NAME: Person_1
Perfect! Give me two of `em.

NAME: Side_10
Quiet! My program's on.

NAME: Side_10
Uh-oh...

NAME: Person_2
Hey, what's going on over there?

NAME: Side_3
Francesco Bernoulli. No wonder
there's a crowd.

NAME: Person_2
Wait, why do you know his name? And
don't say it like that. It's three
syllables, not ten.

NAME: Side_3
What? He's nice to look at. You
know, open-wheeled and all.

NAME: Person_2
What's wrong with fenders? I
thought you like my fenders.

NAME: Person_2
Mater?

NAME: Person_1
Ha ha! That shows what you know.
Dump trucks is dumb.

NAME: Person_2
Those are strong words from a car
that is so fragile.

NAME: Person_2
"Not so fast." What is that, your
new motto?

NAME: Person_2
Well, I would love to. The only
thing is my crew's off for the
season so ---

NAME: Side_28
Pit stop.

NAME: Person_2
You know what? They just got back.
Deal me in, baby. Ka-chow!

NAME: Person_2
I know, I know. I just got back.
But we won't be long and ---

NAME: Side_3
Oh, no, don't worry about me. I've
got enough to do here. Mater's
going to have a blast though.
You're bringing Mater, right? You
never bring him to any of your
races.

NAME: Side_3
Just let him sit in the pits, give
him a headset. C'mon, it'll be a
thrill of a lifetime for him.

NAME: Person_1
Your drinks, sir.

NAME: Person_2
Mater.

NAME: Person_1
I didn't taste it!

NAME: Person_2
How'd you like to come and see the
world with me?

NAME: Person_1
You mean it?

NAME: Person_2
You got me into this thing. You're
coming along.

NAME: Side_2
Guido, look! Ferraris and tires!
Let's go!

NAME: Person_1
You got it, buddy. Hey, what's
that?

NAME: Person_2
Mater!

NAME: Side_23
Hey, McQueen, over here!

NAME: Person_2
Hey, Jeff. Lewis!

NAME: Person_1
Hey! You done good! You got all the
leaves!

NAME: Side_29
Check out that tow truck.

NAME: Side_23
I wonder who that guy's with?

NAME: Person_2
Will you guys excuse me just for
one little second?

NAME: Person_2
Mater, listen. This isn't Radiator
Springs.

NAME: Person_1
You're just realizing that? Boy,
that jet-lag really done a number
on you.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, look -- things are different
over here. Which means maybe you
should, you know, act a little
different too.

NAME: Person_1
Different than what?

NAME: Person_2
Well, just... help me out here,
buddy. I ---

NAME: Person_1
You need help? Shoot, why didn't
you just say so? That's what a tow
truck does. Hey, looky there, it's
Mr. San Francisco!

NAME: Person_1
I'll introduce you.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, no.

NAME: Person_1
Look at me -- I'm helping you
already!

NAME: Person_1
Hey Mr. San Francisco, I'd like you
to meet ---

NAME: Person_5
Lightning McQueen! Buona sera.

NAME: Person_2
Nice to meet you, Francesco.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, nice to meet you too. You are
very good-looking. Not as good as I
thought, but you're good.

NAME: Person_5
Anything for McQueen's friend.

NAME: Person_1
Miss Sally is gonna flip when she
sees this. She's Lightning
McQueen's girlfriend.

NAME: Person_5
Oooh.

NAME: Person_1
She's a big fan of yours.

NAME: Person_5
Hey, she has good taste.

NAME: Person_2
Mater's prone to exaggeration. I
wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.

NAME: Person_1
You're right. She's a huge fan. She
goes on and on about your open
wheels here.

NAME: Person_2
Mentioning it once doesn't qualify
as going "on and on."

NAME: Person_5
Francesco is familiar with this
reaction to Francesco. Women
respect a car that has nothing to
hide.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, uh...

NAME: Person_5
Let us have a toast.

NAME: Person_2
Let's.

NAME: Person_5
I dedicate my win tomorrow... to
Miss Sally.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, sorry. I already dedicated MY
win tomorrow to her. So if we both
do it, it's really not so special.
Besides, I don't have a drink.

NAME: Person_1
I'll go get you one. You mind if I
borrow a few bucks for one of them
drinks?

NAME: Person_2
They're free, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
Free? Well, shoot, what am I doing
here?

NAME: Person_2
I should probably go keep an eye on
him. See you at the race.

NAME: Person_5
Yes, you will see Francesco. But
not like this.

NAME: Person_5
You will see him like this, as he
drives away from you.

NAME: Person_2
That's cute. So you had one of
those made up for all the racers?

NAME: Person_5
No.

NAME: Person_2
Okay.

NAME: Person_2
He is so getting beat tomorrow.

NAME: Side_35
Ladies and gentlecars... Sir Miles
Axlerod!

NAME: Person_9
It is my absolute honor to
introduce to you the competitors in
the first-ever World Grand Prix.
From Brazil. Number eight...

NAME: Person_4
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

NAME: Person_3
That's because it's air-cooled.

NAME: Person_4
I'm Agent Shiftwell, Holley
Shiftwell from the Tokyo Station. I
have a message from London.

NAME: Person_3
Not here.
You must try the canapes on the
mezzanine!

NAME: Person_3
So the lab boys analyzed the photo
I sent? What did they learn about
the camera?

NAME: Person_4
It appears to be a standard
television camera. They said if you
could get closer photos next time,
that would be great.

NAME: Person_3
This was London's message?

NAME: Person_4
Oh -- no, no. No sir. Um, the oil
platforms you were on? Turns out
they're sitting on the biggest oil
reserve in the world.

NAME: Person_3
How did we miss that?

NAME: Person_4
They'd been scrambling everyone's
satellites. The Americans actually
discovered it just before you did.
They placed an agent on that
platform, under deep cover. He was
able to get a photo of the car
who's running the entire operation.

NAME: Person_3
Who is it? Has anyone seen the
photo yet?

NAME: Person_4
No, not yet. The American is here
tonight to pass it to you. He'll
signal you when he's ready.

NAME: Person_3
Oh no.

NAME: Person_4
What is it?

NAME: Person_3
Change of plan. You're meeting the
American.

NAME: Person_4
What, me?

NAME: Person_3
Those thugs down there were on the
oil platform. If they see me, the
whole mission is compromised.

NAME: Person_4
No, no. I'm technical, you see. I'm
in Diagnostics. I'm not a field
agent.

NAME: Person_3
You are now.

NAME: Person_1
I'll take one of them.

NAME: Person_1
Never know which one McQueen'll
have a hankering for.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, what you got here that's free?
How about that pistachio ice cream?

NAME: Side_36
No, no. Wasabi.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, same ol', same ol'. What's up
with you? That looks delicious.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, a little more, please.
It is free, right?
Keep it coming. A little more. Come
on, let's go, it's free! You're
getting there... Scoop scoop!

NAME: Person_1
There you go. Now THAT's a scoop of
ice cream.

NAME: Side_36
My condolences.

NAME: Person_9
... and now, our last competitor ---
Number 95, Lightning McQueen!

NAME: Person_2
Thank you so much for having us,
Sir Axlerod. I really look forward
to racing. This is a great
opportunity.

NAME: Person_9
Oh, the pleasure is all ours,
Lightning. You and your team bring
excellence and professionalism to
this competition.

NAME: Person_1
Somebody get me water!

NAME: Person_1
Whatever you do, do not eat the
free pistachio ice cream. It has
turned!

NAME: Person_2
Sir Axlerod, I can explain. This is
Mater.

NAME: Person_9
I know him. This is the bloke that
called into the television show.
You're the one I have to thank.

NAME: Person_1
No, thank you. This trip's been
amazing.

NAME: Person_2
Mater!

NAME: Person_1
But wait, I... oh, shoot.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene.

NAME: Person_1
But I never leak oil. Never.

NAME: Person_2
Go take care of yourself right now.

NAME: Person_1
Coming through! Excuse me, leakin'
oil. Where's the bathroom? Thank
you. I gotta go!

NAME: Person_1
Sorry ladies!

NAME: Person_1
I never leak I never leak I never
leak...

NAME: Person_1
Wowee...

NAME: Person_1
What in the---

NAME: Side_8
Okay, McMissile. I'm here. It's
time for the drop.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, you've got to be joking.

NAME: Person_3
What's the problem, Shiftwell?

NAME: Person_4
He's in the loo.

NAME: Person_3
So go in!

NAME: Person_4
I can't just go into the men's loo.

NAME: Person_3
Time is of the essence, Shiftwell.

NAME: Person_1
Whatever you do, I would not go in
there.

NAME: Person_1
A Gremlin and a Pacer!

NAME: Person_1
No offense to your makes and
models, but you guys break down
harder than my cousin Betsy after
she got left at the ---

NAME: Person_1
--- altar!

NAME: Person_1
Are you okay?

NAME: Side_8
I'm fine.

NAME: Person_7
Hey. Tow truck.

NAME: Person_7
We'd like to get to our private
business here, if you don't mind.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, yeah. Don't let me get in the
way of your "private business."
Oh! A little advice: When you hear
her giggle and see that waterfall,
you best press that green button.

NAME: Person_7
Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
It's to adjust the temperature.

NAME: Person_8
Got it.

NAME: Person_1
Remember it's in Celsius, not
Fahrenheit.

NAME: Person_7 AND Person_8
Get outta here!

NAME: Person_1
Alright then.

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me, ma'am.

NAME: Person_1
Look out, ladies. Mater's fittin'
to get funky!

NAME: Person_4
Hello.

NAME: Person_1
Well, hello.

NAME: Person_4
A Volkswagen Karmann Ghia has no
radiator.

NAME: Person_1
Well of course it doesn't. That's
`cause it's air-cooled!

NAME: Person_1
Course, Karmann Ghia's weren't the
only ones. Besides the Beetles you
had your Type-3 Squarebacks, with
the pancake motors...

NAME: Person_4
Yeah. Okay, I get it---

NAME: Person_1
... And before both of them,
there's the Type-2 buses - my buddy
Fillmore's one of them.

NAME: Person_4
Listen! We should find somewhere
more private.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, gee. Don't you think that's a
little, uh ---

NAME: Person_1
Well, let's see. Tomorrow I'll be
out there at the races.

NAME: Person_4
Got it. We'll rendezvous then.

NAME: Person_2
There you are. Where have you been?

NAME: Person_1
What's a rendezvous?

NAME: Side_2
It's like a date.

NAME: Person_1
A date?!

NAME: Person_2
Mater, what's going on?

NAME: Person_1
Well, what's going on is I've got
me a date tomorrow.

NAME: Side_2
Guido don't believe you.

NAME: Person_1
Well, believe it. My new girlfriend
just said so. Hey, there she is.

NAME: Person_1
See ya tomorrow!

NAME: Side_2
Guido still don't believe you.

NAME: Person_7
--- you tricked us real good.

NAME: Person_8
And we don't like being tricked.

NAME: Person_8
Hey, what's so funny?

NAME: Side_8
Well, you know, I was just wearing
a disguise. You guys are stuck
looking like that.

NAME: Side_8
Allinol? Thanks, fellas. I hear
this stuff is good for you.

NAME: Person_6
Allinol by itself is good for you.

NAME: Person_6
But after microscopic examination,
I have found that it has one small
weakness. When hit with an
electromagnetic pulse, it becomes
extremely dangerous.

NAME: Person_7
--- for the camera.

NAME: Side_8
Is that all you want? I got a whole
act.

NAME: Person_6
You were very interested in this
camera on the oil platform. Now you
will witness what it really does.

NAME: Side_8
Whatever you say, Professor.

NAME: Person_8
You talked up a lot of cars last
night. Which one's your associate?

NAME: Side_8
Your mother. Oh no, I'm sorry. It
was your sister. You know, I can't
tell them apart these days.

NAME: Person_6
Fifty percent power.
This camera is actually an
electromagnetic pulse emitter.

NAME: Person_8
What about her? Did you give it to
her?

NAME: Person_6
The Allinol is now heating to a
boil, dramatically expanding,
causing the engine block to crack
under the stress, forcing oil into
the combustion chamber.

NAME: Person_8
How about him? You talk to him?

NAME: Side_8
What do I care? I can replace an
engine block.

NAME: Person_6
You may be able to, but after full
impact of the pulse, unfortunately,
there will be nothing to replace.

NAME: Person_8
How about him? Does he have it?

NAME: Person_6
That's him. He's the one.

NAME: Person_7
Roger that, Professor Z.

NAME: Side_8
No!

NAME: Person_6
The project is still on schedule.
You will find this second agent ---

NAME: Person_6
--- and kill him.

NAME: Side_13
I'm Brent Mustangburger, here with
racing legends Darrell Cartrip and
David Hobbscap. There's never been
a competition like this before.

NAME: Side_42
Really, Darrell, I think you need
to clean your windshield. You're
clearly not seeing this for what it
is: Francesco's race to lose.

NAME: Person_5
Really? You are "speed"? Then
Francesco is triple speed.
Francesco. Is. Triple speed.
Francesco likes this, McQueen. It's
really getting him into the zone!

NAME: Person_2
He is so getting beat today.

NAME: Side_10
His suspension stats look good.

NAME: Side_2
Tire pressure is excellent.

NAME: Side_11
He's got plenty of fuel.

NAME: Person_1
And he's awesome!

NAME: Person_4
Why is he in the pits? He's so
exposed.

NAME: Person_3
It's his cover. One of the best
I've seen, too. Look at the detail
on that rust. It must have cost him
a fortune.

NAME: Person_4
But why hasn't he contacted us yet?

NAME: Person_3
There's probably heat on him. Be
patient.

NAME: Person_4
Right, of course. He'll signal us
when he can.

NAME: Person_3
And then we find out who's behind
all this.

NAME: Person_1
McQueen! It's time to make your
move. Get on the outside and show
'em what Doc done taught you.

NAME: Person_2
Nice call, Mater. Keep it up!

NAME: Person_7
Roger that.

NAME: Person_7
You gotta be kidding me.

NAME: Person_8
What is it?

NAME: Person_7
It's that tow truck from the
bathroom.

NAME: Person_8
The one from the bathroom?

NAME: Person_7
Yeah, the one the American Agent
passed the device to.

NAME: Person_8
What about him?

NAME: Person_7
What about him? He's in the pits!

NAME: Person_8
Not for long.

NAME: Person_4
Hold on. I think I've got
something.

NAME: Person_3
What is it?

NAME: Person_4
The Pacer from the party last
night.

NAME: Person_4
Cross-referencing with the photos
from the oil derricks... Yep. His
VIN numbers match.

NAME: Person_3
Anyone with him? He won't be alone.

NAME: Person_4
Conducting analysis on the target.

NAME: Person_4
He's not the only one here.
Three... five... they're
everywhere. And they're all closing
in on... oh no.

NAME: Person_4
Finn? Finn, where are you?

NAME: Person_1
Wow! Some of them fellers is really
loud.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, what?

NAME: Person_2
Guys, a little too much chatter.
Let's keep this line clear.

NAME: Person_1
Is there gonna be cable where you
is so I can watch the rest of the
race?

NAME: Person_1
Well, all right but I usually like
to have a proper detailing done
before I meet a lady friend.

NAME: Person_8
Finn McMissile? But you're dead!

NAME: Person_3
Then this shouldn't hurt at all.

NAME: Person_3
Miss Shiftwell?

NAME: Person_4
I've got him in the back alleys
east of the garages. Multiple
assailants are closing in quickly.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, new lady friend? You like
flowers?

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
Stay outside. Gotcha.

NAME: Person_2
Outside?

NAME: Person_5
Grazie and arrivaderci!

NAME: Person_8
This time I'm gonna make sure you
stay dead.

NAME: Person_1
What's that? You want me to head
toward that ruckus?

NAME: Person_1
Wow! A live karate demonstration!

NAME: Person_2
Stop it, Mater. Just sign off.

NAME: Person_1
That was cool! Hey, can I get your
autograph?

NAME: Person_1
Hey, where'd he go?

NAME: Person_1
Dadgum, did I miss our date?

NAME: Side_30
Francesco, over here! Hey, what was
your strategy today?

NAME: Person_5
Strategia? Francesco needs no
strategy, it's very simple. You
start the race, wait for Lightning
McQueen to choke, pass him, then
win. Francesco always wins. It's
boring.

NAME: Person_5
To truly crush one's dream, you
must first raise their hopes very
high.

NAME: Person_2
Mater.

NAME: Person_1
Hey McQueen! What happened? Is the
race over? You won, right?

NAME: Person_2
Mater, why were you yelling things
at me while I was racing?

NAME: Person_1
Yelling? Oh, you thought... that's
funny right there. Nah, see that's
`cause I seen these two fellers
doing some sort of karate street
performance. It was nutso. One of
them even had a flamethrower ---

NAME: Person_2
A flamethrower? What are you
talking about? I don't understand.
Where were you?

NAME: Person_1
Going to meet my date.

NAME: Person_2
Your date?

NAME: Person_1
She started talking to me as a
voice in my head, telling me where
to go ---

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute -- I didn't screw you
up, did I?

NAME: Person_2
I lost the race because of you!

NAME: Person_1
Well, I'm sorry. I didn't mean ---

NAME: Person_2
An imaginary girlfriend,
flamethrowers. This is exactly why
I don't bring you along to these
things.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe if I, I don't know, talked to
somebody and explained what
happened I could help.

NAME: Person_2
I don't need your help. I don't
want your help.

NAME: Side_43
- McQueen, you had it in the bag!
- Yeah, what happened?

NAME: Person_2
I made a mistake. But I can assure
you, it won't happen again.

NAME: Person_2
Look, guys. We know what the
problem is and we've taken care of
it.

NAME: Side_13
Lightning McQueen loses in the last
lap to Francesco Bernoulli in the
first race of the World Grand Prix
and three, count em, three cars
flamed out leading some to suggest
that their fuel, Allinol, might be
to blame.

NAME: Person_9
Allinol is safe! Alternative fuel
is safe! There is no way my fuel
caused these cars to flame out!

NAME: Side_30
Well the jury may still be out on
whether Allinol caused these
accidents, but one thing's for
sure: Lightning McQueen blew this
race.

NAME: Side_13
Team McQueen can't be happy right
now.

NAME: Side_37
Come with me please, sir.

NAME: Person_1
But I'm gonna miss my plane.

NAME: Side_37
Right this way.

NAME: Person_1
Doggone it. This is about my hook,
isn't it? I know I should've
checked it, but I can't really,
look -- it's attached to me.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, I know you. You're that feller
from the karate demonstration.

NAME: Person_3
I never properly introduced myself.
Finn McMissile. British
Intelligence.

NAME: Person_1
Tow Mater. Average intelligence.

NAME: Person_3
Who are you with? FBI, CIA?

NAME: Person_1
Let's just say I'm triple-A
affiliated. You know, I know some
karate. I don't wanna brag or
nothing, but I've got me a black
fan belt.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, you wanna see some moves I
made up?

NAME: Person_3
You're being followed.

NAME: Person_1
This first one I can reach into a
car's hood, pull out his battery,
and show it to him before he
stalls. I call it, "What I
accidentally did to my friend Luigi
once."

NAME: Person_7
There he is!

NAME: Person_1
Look, I probably ought to go. I'm
about to miss my flight.

NAME: Person_3
Don't worry.

NAME: Person_3
I've taken care of that. Hang on.

NAME: Person_1
This is First Class service. You
don't even have to go through the
terminal.

NAME: Person_3
Drive forward. Whatever you do,
don't stop.

NAME: Person_1
Is everything okay back there?

NAME: Person_3
Roger that.

NAME: Person_1
I knew I should've done carry-on!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, doggone it. It's my imaginary
girlfriend!

NAME: Person_4
Come on! Get in here!

NAME: Person_3
Hold on, Sid!

NAME: Side_24
Finn, it's now or never!

NAME: Side_24
Hold on!

NAME: Person_2
"I'm so sorry for what I did. I
don't want to be the cause of you
losing any more races. I want you
to go prove to the world what I
already know - that you are the
greatest race car in the whole wide
world. Your best friend, Mater."

NAME: Person_2
I didn't really want him to leave.

NAME: Side_2
NAME: Side_44
Wait, there's more here.
"P.S. Please tell the hotel I
didn't mean to order that movie. I
thought it was just a preview and I
didn't realize I was paying for it.
P.P.S... That's funny right there --
There's a few more pages of P.S.'s
here.

NAME: Person_3
Now that's how I like to start the
day! You never feel more alive than
when you're almost dead.

NAME: Person_1
That's the closest I ever been to
missing my flight! That was ---

NAME: Person_4
Still in one piece, great.

NAME: Person_1
I gotta go to a doctor. I keep
getting these sharp pains in my
undercarriage.

NAME: Person_4
Downloading the photo now.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, lemme introduce you two.
This here is Finn McSomething-or-
other. He's a First Class VIP
airport whatchamacallit. And Finn,
this here's my date.
I never did get your name.

NAME: Person_4
Oh yes, sorry. It's Shiftwell.
Holley Shiftwell.

NAME: Person_3
Finally. Time to see who's behind
all this.

NAME: Person_4
What is this?

NAME: Person_1
Well, that's one of the worst
engines ever made. It's an old
aluminum V8 with a Lucas electrical
system and Whitworth bolts. Shoot,
them Whitworth bolts is a pain,
tell you what. Them ain't metric,
they ain't inches...

NAME: Person_4
Yes, OK, right. But who's engine is
this, Mater?

NAME: Person_1
Well, it's kinda hard to tell from
this picture, ain't it?

NAME: Person_4
But you're the one who took it.

NAME: Person_3
Holley.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, right. Yes, of course. "A good
agent gets what he can, then gets
out before he's killed." Sorry.

NAME: Person_1
Agent? You mean like insurance
agent, like,
`Like a good neighbor, Mater is
there'? Wait, you mean secret
agents. You guys is spies!

NAME: Person_3
Holley, in how many makes and
models did this type of engine
appear?

NAME: Person_4
It was standard in seven models
over a 12-year period. At least
35,000 cars were made with this
engine.

NAME: Person_1
You're pretty.

NAME: Person_1
And so nice.

NAME: Person_4
Just pay attention.

NAME: Person_3
This seems like a dead end. If
there were something in the photo
that could narrow this down a bit
I'd be a lot happier.

NAME: Person_1
You might not be happy, but I bet
this feller is. See how he's had
most of his parts replaced? And see
all them boxes over there? Them's
all original parts. They ain't easy
to come by.

NAME: Person_4
Rare parts.

NAME: Person_3
That's something we can track.

NAME: Person_4
Exactly!

NAME: Person_3
Well done, Mater! I would never
have seen that.
I know of a black-market parts
dealer in Paris, a treacherous
lowlife. But, he's the only car in
the world who can tell us whose
engine this is. Mater, what would
you say to setting up an informal
task force on this one?

NAME: Person_1
Wait, what?

NAME: Person_3
You obviously have plenty of
experience in the field.

NAME: Person_1
Well yeah I live right next to one.
I don't know, Finn. I ain't exactly
been much help to anybody recently.

NAME: Person_3
You're helping me. Please, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
Well, okay. But you know I'm just a
tow truck, right?

NAME: Person_3
Right. And I'm just in the
import/export business. Siddeley?

NAME: Side_24
Yes, Finn?

NAME: Person_3
Paris. Tout de suite.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, two of them sweets for me
too, Sid!
You know, I always wanted to be a
spy.

NAME: Side_24
Afterburners, sir?

NAME: Person_3
Is there any other way?

NAME: Person_4
No VIN scans. Got it.

NAME: Person_3
Don't talk to anyone. Don't look at
anyone. And absolutely, positively
no idling. Are we clear?

NAME: Person_4
Yes, right. No idling. Yes, sir.

NAME: Person_3
Mater?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, Finn?

NAME: Person_3
We're not here to go shopping.

NAME: Person_1
Shopping? What do you mean? Why
would I ---

NAME: Person_1
Dadgum.

NAME: Side_45
- Parts for sale, Monsieur!
- Monsieur! Parts for sale!

NAME: Person_1
You gotta be kidding me - they've
got everything here. Look at them
hoods! I could use a hood.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry fellers, I gotta go.

NAME: Person_1
Excuse me. What are you selling?

NAME: Person_3
There you are.

NAME: Person_1
Man, there are some great ---

NAME: Person_3
Mater, get back!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, wait for me!

NAME: Person_4
But I thought ---

NAME: Person_3
Mater! This chap needs a tow. Hook
him up.

NAME: Person_1
Sure thing.

NAME: Side_6
You rusty piece of junk, get your
dirty hook off me!

NAME: Person_3
Allez! Maintenant - vite!

NAME: Person_3
Easy, Tomber. This is her first
field assignment - she didn't know
you were my informant.

NAME: Person_4
Informant?

NAME: Side_6
A rookie, eh? I never liked new car-
smell.

NAME: Person_3
Tomber was doing 20 to life in a
Moroccan impound the first time I
saved him, if I recall correctly.

NAME: Side_6
Speaking of recalls, you're getting
up there in mileage aren't you,
Finn?

NAME: Person_4
Alright, we get it. You both know
each other, you're both old. So.

NAME: Person_4
There you go, informant. Inform us.

NAME: Side_6
That is the worst motor ever made.

NAME: Side_6
Wait. That oil filter... those
wheel bearings.

NAME: Person_3
Do those parts look familiar,
Tomber?

NAME: Side_6
They should. I sold them.

NAME: Person_4
To whom?

NAME: Side_6
No idea. He's my best customer, but
he always does his business over
the phone. I was always wondering
why he needs so many parts. Now I
know.

NAME: Person_1
Well, a lemon needs parts. Ain't
nothing truer than that.

NAME: Person_3
"Lemon?"

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, you know. Cars that don't
ever work right. Lemons is a tow
truck's bread and butter. Like them
Gremlins and Pacers we run into at
the party and the race and the
airport.

NAME: Person_3
Holley, pull up the pictures from
the oil platform. I want to know
what other type of cars were out
there.

NAME: Person_4
Right. Let's see. There were Hugos.
And Trunkovs.

NAME: Person_3
Mater, are these cars considered
lemons?

NAME: Person_1
Is the Popemobile Catholic?

NAME: Person_4
Finn. Everyone involved in this
plot is one of history's biggest
loser cars.

NAME: Person_3
And they're all taking their orders
from the car behind this engine.

NAME: Side_6
This explains it!

NAME: Person_3
What, Tomber?

NAME: Side_6
Gremlin, Pacer, Hugo and Trunkovs
never get together. But they're
having a secret meeting in two
days.

NAME: Person_3
Where's this meeting taking place?

NAME: Side_6
Porto Corsa, Italy.

NAME: Person_1
That's where the next race is!

NAME: Person_3
Then there's a good chance our
mystery engine will be there too.

NAME: Side_6
Your chances are more than good. I
just sent him a new clutch assembly
yesterday... to Porto Corsa.

NAME: Person_3
Holley, contact Stephenson and have
him meet us at Gare de Lyon. Good
work.

NAME: Person_1
You never see this many lemons in
one town. Unless there's a swap
meet, or something.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, how'd you get all them
pictures?

NAME: Person_4
Well, I remotely reprogrammed Porto
Corsa's red light cameras to do
recognition scans.

NAME: Person_1
Wow, not only is you the prettiest
car I ever met, but you the
smartest too.

NAME: Person_4
Thank you. I think.

NAME: Person_1
That's a familiar sight.

NAME: Person_1
A Hugo being towed. But he looks
absolutely perfect.

NAME: Person_3
Of course. They must be the heads
of the lemon families.

NAME: Person_1
Makes sense. If I was rich and
broke down every day, I'd hire me
to tow me around all the time too.

NAME: Person_3
We've got to infiltrate that
meeting. It's the only way to find
out who's behind all this.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_4
Hold still.

NAME: Person_1
Ahh!

NAME: Person_3
Good job, Miss Shiftwell.

NAME: Person_4
Thank you, Finn.

NAME: Person_1
Boy, I sure wish my friends could
see me now.

NAME: Side_2
Guido, your eyes do not deceive
you. We are in Italy. We are home!

NAME: Side_11
Hey, Luigi. Which way to the hotel,
man?

NAME: Side_2
What? No friends of mine will stay
in a hotel in my village. You will
stay with my --- Uncle Topolino!

NAME: Side_10
How do they do it? These are the
same ingredients as back home, but
it tastes so good.

NAME: Side_11
It's organic, man.

NAME: Side_10
Tree hugger.

NAME: Side_4
You look so down, so low. Is like
you have flat tires.

NAME: Side_4
She said you look like you're
starving. That she's going to make
you a big meal, and fatten you up.

NAME: Person_2
No, Mama Topolino, please. You
don't need to make a fuss!

NAME: Side_4
Capisco. I understand. Is a
problem, yes? Between you and a
friend?

NAME: Person_2
How'd you know that?

NAME: Side_4
A wise car hears one word and
understands two.

NAME: Side_4
That, and Luigi told me. While Mama
cooks, come and take a stroll with
me.

NAME: Person_2
I brought my friend Mater along on
the trip. And I told him he needed
to act different, that we weren't
in Radiator Springs.

NAME: Side_4
This Mater. He's a close friend?

NAME: Person_2
He's my best friend.

NAME: Side_4
Then why would you ask him to be
someone else?

NAME: Person_2
What did I do? I said some things
during our fight...

NAME: Side_4
You know, back when Guido and Luigi
used to work for me, they would
fight over everything.

NAME: Side_4
They fight over what Ferrari was
the best Ferrari; which one of
them look more like a Ferrari...
There were even some non-Ferrari
fights.

NAME: Side_4
So I tell them, va bene. It's okay
to fight. Everybody fights now and
then, especially best friends.

NAME: Side_4
But you gotta make up fast.

NAME: Side_4
No fight more important than
friendship.

NAME: Side_4
Chi trova un'amico, trova un
tesoro.

NAME: Person_2
What does that mean?

NAME: Side_46
Now, mangia! Eat!

NAME: Side_47
Finn, one hour to Porto Corsa.

NAME: Person_3
Thank you, Stephenson.

NAME: Person_4
That should just about do it.

NAME: Person_3
Perfect.

NAME: Person_4
So Mater, it's voice-activated. But
you know, everything's voice-
activated these days.

NAME: Person_1
What? I thought you was supposed to
be making me a disguise.

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Voice recognized. Disguise Program
Initiated.

NAME: Person_1
Cool! Hey, computer. Make me a
German truck!

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: Person_1
Check it out. I'm wearing
Materhosen. Make me a monster
truck!

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: Person_1
A funny car!

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: Person_3
The idea is to keep a low profile,
Mater.

NAME: Person_1
So I just go in, pretend to be this
truck.

NAME: Person_3
And leave the rest to us.

NAME: Person_4
Now hold still.

NAME: Person_4
I have to do the final fitting on
your disguise.

NAME: Person_4
Oh dear. That's no good.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, what are you doing?

NAME: Person_4
The disguise won't calibrate
effectively without a smooth
surface to graft onto.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. For a second there I thought
you was trying to fix my dents.

NAME: Person_4
I was.

NAME: Person_1
Well then no thank you. I don't get
them dents buffed, pulled, filled
or painted by nobody. They're way
too valuable.

NAME: Person_4
Your dents are valuable?

NAME: Person_1
I come by each one of them with my
best friend Lightning McQueen.

NAME: Person_1
I don't fix these. I want to
remember these dents forever.

NAME: Person_4
So you were being serious in Paris?
McQueen isn't just part of your
cover?

NAME: Person_3
Friendships can be dangerous in our
line of work, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
But my line of work is towing and
salvage.

NAME: Person_3
Right. And Miss Shiftwell's is
designing iPhone apps.

NAME: Person_1
No, I meant for real. I ---

NAME: Person_4
It's okay. Say no more. I'll work
around the dent.

NAME: Person_3
In the meantime...

NAME: Person_3
You look a little light on weapons.

NAME: Side_13
The big news continues to be
Allinol. Sir Miles Axlerod spoke to
the press earlier today to answer
questions about its safety.

NAME: Person_9
An independent panel of scientists
has determined that Allinol is
completely safe. Okay? Safe! There
it is.

NAME: Side_13
So the race will go on, folks.

NAME: Side_30
But the question everyone is
asking: Will the real Lightning
McQueen show up today?

NAME: Person_5
Bellissima! Thank you for your
support.
And your big mistake, McQueen!

NAME: Side_2
McQueen? Is everything okay?

NAME: Side_11
If you're worried about your fuel,
man, don't. It's perfectly safe.

NAME: Person_2
No, guys, I just really wish Mater
were here.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, great. Here it comes. What've
you got, Francesco?

NAME: Person_5
For famous race cars like Francesco
and well... you, to be far away
from home is not easy.

NAME: Person_2
I think you forgot the insulting
part of that insult.

NAME: Person_5
Is no insult. When Francesco is
away from home, he misses his mama
just like you miss your tow truck
amico.

NAME: Person_2
Gee, I maybe misjudged you, because
that's exactly how I ---

NAME: Person_5
Of course, I am at home. And my
mama is right here.

NAME: Person_5
McQueen is very sad! I will beat
his cry-baby bottom today!

NAME: Person_2
And there's the insult we were
missing. Grazie!

NAME: Side_14
Gremlins. Man, those are some ugly
cars. Look like someone stole their
trunks.

NAME: Person_4
Scusatemi, tutti! Signori!

NAME: Person_4
Mio nonno, my grandfather, has
broken down. If one of you would
help I would be so thankful.

NAME: Side_19
Sounds like you need some "roadside
assistance".

NAME: Side_48
She was talking to me, Ivan.

NAME: Side_19
Oh really? Prove it.

NAME: Person_4
No, no, don't fight over me.

NAME: Person_4
Signore Tow Truck, per favore?

NAME: Person_3
You're on any moment now.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know about this, Finn.
What if I screw things up?

NAME: Person_1
It's just that them guys look
pretty tough and --- Wait, did you
say "idiot"? Is that how you see
me?

NAME: Person_4
Why aren't you in disguise?

NAME: Person_1
I, uh---

NAME: Person_4
Come on, there's no time. Go!

NAME: Person_1
Okay, okay. Computer: disguise.

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Request acknowledged.

NAME: Side_14
It's the boss! He is coming!

NAME: Side_20
Ivan!

NAME: Side_20
Ivan, why do you insult me so by
making me wait?

NAME: Person_4
He's in.

NAME: Side_49
Air Freshener, antenna balls,
sparkplugs...

NAME: Person_1
Why is that? What do you mean don't
talk to you?
(more talking from Holley
which we cannot hear)
So you want me to stop talking to
you. Right now?

NAME: Side_14
You are acting strange today, Ivan.

NAME: Person_1
I have no idea what you're talking
about...

NAME: Person_1
...Alexander Hugo, aka "Chop Shop
Alex."

NAME: Person_1
Hey, you got a lot of aka's, Alex.
But I guess that makes sense
seeings how you's wanted in France,
Germany, the Czech Republic...

NAME: Person_4
NAME: Side_50
(cutting in to his
Mater! Stop it!

NAME: Side_14
Okay, okay. Keep your voice down.
You're gonna make me arrested.
Don't mess with Ivan today. He's in
a bad mood.

NAME: Person_3
He's so good.

NAME: Side_9
Victor!

NAME: TUBBS PPerson_8
Hey, Victor!

NAME: J. CURBY Person_7LIN
There you are.

NAME: Side_9
Come in, come in.

NAME: J. CURBY Person_7LIN
Victor Hugo. I'm J. Curby Gremlin,
from Detroit. It's good to see you.
Now we can start.

NAME: Side_20
Is the big boss here yet?

NAME: Side_9
No, not yet.

NAME: TUBBS PPerson_8
He's supposed to be here any
minute.

NAME: Person_3
Here we go.

NAME: Person_6
Guten Tag!

NAME: TUBBS PPerson_8
It's just the Professor.

NAME: Side_20
Zundapp, when is he coming?

NAME: Person_6
He's already here.

NAME: Side_35
Welcome, everyone.

NAME: Side_5
I wish I could be with you on this
very special day but... my clutch
assembly broke. You know how it is.

NAME: TUBBS PPerson_8
Been there.

NAME: J. CURBY Person_7LIN
Forget about it.

NAME: Side_9
We know how you feel.

NAME: Person_3
Descramble that voice!

NAME: Person_4
I'm trying... It's too
sophisticated!

NAME: Side_5
We are here to celebrate. Today all
your hard work pays off. The world
turned their backs on cars like us.
They stopped manufacturing us,
stopped making our parts. The only
thing they haven't stopped doing is
laughing at us. They've called us
terrible names...

NAME: Side_5
Jalopy. Rustbucket.

NAME: Side_5
Heap. Clunker.

NAME: Side_5
Junker, beater, wreck.

NAME: Side_5
Rattletrap.

NAME: Side_5
Lemon. But their insults just give
us strength. Because today, my
friends...

NAME: Side_5
...that all ends.

NAME: Person_3
What just happened?

NAME: Person_4
I'm working on it.

NAME: Side_5
They laughed at us. But now it's
our turn to laugh back.

NAME: Person_3
Holley?

NAME: Person_4
I'm detecting an extremely strong
electromagnetic pulse.

NAME: Person_4
Finn, it's the camera!

NAME: Person_3
Where?

NAME: Person_4
On the tower.

NAME: Side_5
And we, the owners of the world's
largest untapped oil reserve, will
become the most powerful cars in
the world!

NAME: Person_3
Get out of the way! Andate!

NAME: Side_5
They will come to us and they will
have no choice, `cause they will
need us.

NAME: Person_3
No!

NAME: Side_5
Long live Lemons!

NAME: Person_4
Finn.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah!

NAME: Person_5
Dah! This is impossible!

NAME: Person_2
That's what I'm talking about.
Kachow! Hey, where are all the
other cars?

NAME: Person_5
What is going on?

NAME: Side_13
Sir Axlerod! Is the final race in
London still going to take place?

NAME: J. CURBY Person_7LIN
I can't believe this is really
happening.

NAME: Side_9
Shh, quiet!

NAME: Side_9
Here it comes.

NAME: Person_6
A toast! To the death of Allinol
and alternative fuel forever!

NAME: Person_4
Mater. Abort the mission. They've
got Finn. Get out of there. Get out
of there right now!

NAME: Side_19
How is your grandfather?

NAME: Side_14
Isn't this a great party, Ivan?

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah, it's unbelievable.

NAME: Side_14
You are not leaving, are you?

NAME: Person_1
Uh, of course I ain't leavin'.

NAME: Person_1
McQueen?

NAME: Side_51
- What?! - Did he just say
Allinol? After today?

NAME: Person_6
Yes, sir. Of course.

NAME: Person_6
Allinol must be finished for good.
McQueen cannot win the last race.
Lightning McQueen must be killed.

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Person_6
It's the American spy!

NAME: Person_1
Dadgum.

Aspetti!

Lemme through! Lemme through!

NAME: Person_1
No, listen! I was disguised as a
tow truck to infiltrate this
Lemonhead meeting and my weapons
system misinterperated what I was

NAME: Person_1
McQueen! McQueen!

NAME: Side_25
Right this way, signore.

NAME: Person_2
Mater?

NAME: Person_1
McQueen!

NAME: Person_1
McQueen!

NAME: Person_2
That really sounded like Mater.
Mater?

NAME: Person_1
McQueen, they're gonna kill you!!

NAME: Person_2
Mater?!

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me.

NAME: Side_25
No, no, where are you going?
Please, Mr. McQueen!

NAME: Person_2
Scusi. Mater! Scusi...

NAME: Person_2
Mater, I'm so glad to see you. I'm
so sorr ---

NAME: Side_19
Lightning McQueen! I am a huge fan.

NAME: Side_19
Yes, but that was me. I said, "You
killed out there today." You're
the best.

NAME: Person_2
What? Oh. I mean, thanks.

NAME: Side_25
Right this way, signore ---

NAME: Person_2
I really thought I heard my friend.

NAME: Person_2
Wait, what?

NAME: Side_25
Please, the world press is waiting.
You come with me, please.

NAME: Person_1
Let me go!

NAME: Person_6
You actually care about that race
car. A pity you didn't warn him in
time.

NAME: Person_1
Domo arigato!

NAME: Person_1
You done good! You got all the
leaves!

NAME: Side_29
Check out that tow truck.

NAME: Side_23
I wonder who that guy's with?

NAME: Person_1
Now that's a scoop of ice cream!

NAME: Person_1
I never leak oil. Never.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, you have to get a hold of
yourself. You're making a scene!

NAME: Person_1
Wait a minute. I didn't screw you
up, did I?

NAME: Person_2
I lost the race because of you!

NAME: Person_1
Maybe if I talked to somebody, or---

NAME: Person_2
I don't need your help. I don't
want your help!

NAME: Person_1
Bang a gong, get it on!

NAME: Person_2
Listen, this isn't Radiator
Springs. This is exactly why I
don't bring you along to these
things!

NAME: Person_1
Holley! Finn! Where are we?

NAME: Person_3
We're in London, Mater. Inside Big
Bentley.

NAME: Person_1
Woaaaah! ---

NAME: Person_1
This... this is all my fault.

NAME: Person_3
Don't be a fool, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
But I am, remember? You said so.

NAME: Person_3
When did I... Oh. Mater, I was
complimenting you on what a good
spy you are.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not a spy!

NAME: Person_1
I've been trying to tell you that
the whole time. I really am just a
tow truck.

NAME: Person_4
Finn, he's not joking.

NAME: Person_3
I know.

NAME: Person_1
You were right, Finn. I'm a fool.
And what's happened to McQueen is
`cause I'm such a big one. This is
all my fault.

NAME: Person_7
Good, you're up!

NAME: Person_8
And just in time!

NAME: Person_7
Professor Z wanted you to have a
front row seat for the death of
Lightning McQueen.

NAME: Person_8
Not for much longer.

NAME: Person_2
I called to talk to Mater. It never
occurred to me that he wouldn't be
there.

NAME: Side_22
Sheriff is talking to Scotland Yard
right now.

NAME: Side_18
And Sarge is in touch with his
friends in the British military.

NAME: Side_3
You just need to focus on the race.

NAME: Person_2
I know, but Sal, with everything
going on I'm not sure I should---

NAME: Person_2
Sir Axlerod.

NAME: Person_9
I'm sorry to interrupt.

NAME: Person_2
No, no, it's all right.

NAME: Person_9
I just wanted to come down here and
personally thank you. Because after
Italy, I was finished. And then you
gave me one last shot.

NAME: Person_2
Listen, I ---

NAME: Person_9
And I probably shouldn't be saying
this at all but... I hope you win
today. Show the world that they've
been wrong about Allinol.

NAME: Side_3
Mater would want you to race.

NAME: Person_2
All right. For Mater.

NAME: Person_7
Here he comes!

NAME: Person_7
I don't know, Professor.

NAME: Person_8
What did you do?

NAME: Person_8
You broke it.

NAME: Person_7
Quiet!
I understand, sir. Yes.

NAME: Person_8
What'd he say?

NAME: Person_7
We go to the backup plan.

NAME: Person_1
Backup plan??

We snuck a bomb in McQueen's pit!

NAME: Person_8
The next time he makes a stop,
instead of saying "ka-chow," he's
gonna go "ka-boom"!

NAME: Person_7
Don't feel bad, tow truck. You
couldn't have saved him.

NAME: Person_8
Oh, wait. You could have!

NAME: Person_1
Dadgum lemons.

NAME: Person_7
What, you didn't think we'd take
your bullets?

NAME: Person_8
That's right! You got nothin'.

NAME: Person_7
Who's the lemon now, huh?

NAME: Person_3
Nice try, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
Dadgum!

NAME: Person_1
Dadgum! Dadgum! Dadgum!

NAME: Person_4
Mater!

NAME: Person_1
I gotta get you all out of there!

NAME: Person_3
There's no time. McQueen needs your
help, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
But I can't, I'm just a tow truck.

NAME: Person_3
It's up to you. Go to the pits and
get everyone out. You can do that.

NAME: Person_1
What about you guys?

NAME: Person_3
We'll be okay.

NAME: Person_4
Go and get some more dents, Mater.

NAME: Person_4
So we'll be "okay"? Really?

NAME: Person_3
He wouldn't have left if I'd told
him the truth.
Being killed by a clock. Gives a
whole new meaning to "your time has
come."

NAME: Person_4
Time. That's it!

NAME: Person_3
What are you doing?

NAME: Person_4
Trying to turn back time. If I can
just reverse the polarity...

NAME: Person_3
Good job! Quick thinking, Holley!

NAME: Person_1
What's everybody on the wrong side
of the road for?!

NAME: Person_4
Oh no!

NAME: Person_4
Oh no. That's Mater's.

NAME: Person_3
I knew his escape was too easy.

NAME: Side_2
Mater!

NAME: Person_1
Everybody get out! Get out now!
Y'all gotta get out the pits!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

NAME: Side_3
We're here because of you, Mater.

NAME: Side_18
Is everything okay?

NAME: Person_1
No! Everything's not okay! There's
a bomb in here! Y'all gotta get
out! Now!

NAME: Side_53
- A bomb? - Huh? - Woah.

NAME: Person_3
Mater, listen to me. The bomb is on
you.

NAME: Person_3
They knew you'd try to help
McQueen. When we were knocked out
they planted it in your air filter.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-oh.

NAME: Person_2
Mater! There you are!

NAME: Person_1
Stop right there!

NAME: Person_2
Oh man, I've been so worried about
you!

NAME: Person_1
Don't come any closer!

NAME: Person_2
Are you okay?

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm not okay. Stay away from
me!!

NAME: Person_2
No, wait. Wait!

NAME: Person_2
Mater, wait!

NAME: Person_2
Mater, wait!

NAME: Person_1
Stay back! If you get close to me,
you gonna get hurt real bad!

NAME: Person_2
I know I made you feel that way
before, but none of that matters
because we're best friends!

NAME: Person_1
McQueen, you don't get it. I'm the
bomb!

NAME: Person_2
Yes, Mater! You are the bomb!
That's what I'm trying to say here.
You've always been the bomb! And
you'll always be the bomb.

NAME: Person_1
Stay away!

NAME: Person_2
No! Never!

Get McQueen!!

Holley. I'll get Zundapp, you help
Mater.

NAME: Person_4
Got it!

NAME: Person_5
What is happening?!

NAME: Side_21
Hurry, Professor!

NAME: Person_3
Do you really think I'm going to
let you float away, Professor?

NAME: Person_1
McQueen, let go!

NAME: Person_2
Never!

NAME: Person_6
Give it up, McMissile!

NAME: Person_4
Mater, stop!

NAME: Person_1
No way! You could get hurt!

NAME: Person_4
Oh no.

NAME: Person_4
Mater, we've got to get that bomb
off you.

NAME: Person_2
Bomb?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, they strapped it to me to
kill you as a back-up plan.

NAME: Person_2
Back-up plan? Mater, who put a bomb
on you?

NAME: Person_2
Death ray?

NAME: Person_3
Turn off the bomb, Zundapp!

NAME: Person_6
Are you all so dense? It's voice-
activated. Everything is voice-
activated these days.

Deactivate! Deactivate!

it can only be disarmed by the one

Fellers, listen.

I know what you're going through.
Everybody's been laughing at me my

gonna make you feel better.

Not today, boys!

Thanks for the help, Corporal.

NAME: Side_54
Anything for one of pop's mates.

NAME: Person_2
What's he saying?! What's wrong!?

NAME: Side_2
None of his wrenches fit the bolts!

NAME: Person_1
I get it. I get it! I know what
needs to be done.

NAME: Person_2
Then do it!

NAME: Person_1
What? No, I can't do it. Look,
nobody takes me seriously. I know
that now. This ain't Radiator
Springs.

NAME: Person_2
Yes it is.

NAME: Person_2
You're yourself in Radiator
Springs. Be yourself here. And if
people aren't taking you seriously,
then they need to change. Not you.
I know that, because I was wrong
before. Now you can do this. You're
the bomb.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks, buddy.

NAME: Person_2
No no no, you're the actual bomb.
Now let's go!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, right! Hang on!

NAME: Person_3
Where's he going?

NAME: Person_1
Computer!

NAME: Person_1'S COMPUTER
Yes, Agent Mater.

I need that thing you done before
to get me away from McQueen!

Back up! Back away!

NAME: Side_31'S Side_57S
Get back!

NAME: Person_2
No, no, it's okay! Tell them,
Mater. Explain.

NAME: Person_1
Okay! Somebody's been sabotaging
the racers and hurting the cars and
I know who. Oh wait... Your
Majesty.

NAME: Side_31'S Side_57S
- Bomb! - It's a bomb! - Everybody
down! - Look out!

NAME: Person_3
Mater, I don't know what you're
doing but stand down now!

NAME: Person_1
This ain't nothing at all like
Radiator Springs.

NAME: Person_2
Mater, just cut to the chase!

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
It's him.

NAME: Person_9
What? Me? You've got to be crazy.

NAME: Person_1
I figured it out when I realized
you all attached this ticking time
bomb with Whitworth bolts. The same
bolts that hold together that old
British engine from the photograph.
Holley! Show that picture.

NAME: Person_4
O-kay...

NAME: Person_1
And then I remembered what they say
about old British engines - "If
there ain't no oil under `em, there
ain't no oil in `em."

NAME: Person_9
What is he talking about?

NAME: Person_1
It was you leaking oil at the party
in Japan. You just blamed it on me.

NAME: Person_9
Electric cars don't use oil, you
twit.

NAME: Person_1
Then you're faking it. You didn't
convert to no electric. We pop that
hood we gonna see that engine from
that picture right there.

NAME: Person_9
This lorry's crazy. He's going to
kill us all!

NAME: Person_9
Stay away!

NAME: Person_4
But Sir Axlerod created the race,
Mater. Why would he want to hurt
anyone?

NAME: Person_1
To make Allinol look bad so
everybody'd go back to using oil. I
mean, he said it himself with that
disguised voice.

NAME: Person_9
"Dee-sguised voice?" What are you
talking about? You're nuts, you
are!

NAME: Side_56
This is going nowhere fast. We
really should go, Grandmother.

NAME: Side_31
One moment. I'd like to see where
this is going.

NAME: Person_3
Mater, he created Allinol.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, but what if he found that
huge oil field just as the world
was trying to find something else?

NAME: Person_1
What if he came up with Allinol
just to make alternative fuel look
bad?

NAME: Person_9
"What if?" You're basing this on a
"What if"?!

NAME: Side_57
Okay, that's it.

NAME: Person_9
Wait! Somebody save me! The lorry's
crazy!

NAME: Person_9
Keep away, you idiot!

NAME: Person_3
Mater!

NAME: Person_4
Mater!

NAME: Person_9
Someone do something!

NAME: Person_9
You're insane, you are!
Deactivate!!

NAME: THE BOMB'S COMPUTER Side_35
Bomb deactivated. Have a nice day,
Sir Axlerod.

NAME: Person_3
The engine from the photo.

NAME: Person_4
It's a perfect match!

NAME: Person_9
How did the tow truck figure it
out?

NAME: Person_1
Now you're talking!

NAME: Person_2
Mater, let's go. You're on.

NAME: Side_59
Your Majesty. May I present for the
investiture of honorary Knighthood
of the British Realm. Tow Mater of
Radiator Springs.

NAME: Person_2
Go get `em, buddy.

NAME: Side_31
I hereby dub thee "Sir Tow Mater."

NAME: Person_1
McMissile, McQueen. Queen?
McMissile.

NAME: Person_1
So there I was: rocket jets going
full blast, McQueen hanging on for
dear life when suddenly them two
nasty lemons come out of nowhere,
guns drawed. We was goners. But
then out of nowhere, this beautiful
spy car swoops in from the sky to
save us!

NAME: Side_40
That's a very entertaining story,
young man.

NAME: Side_32
Oh, Minny, please. Come on, none of
this happened. Rocket jets? Flying
spy cars?

NAME: Person_4
No, you're quite right. It does
sound a bit far-fetched.

NAME: Person_1
Holley! Finn!

NAME: Person_4
Hello, Mater. It's so nice to see
you again.

NAME: Person_1
What're you doing here?

NAME: Person_3
Our satellites picked up an urgent
communique.

NAME: Side_2
So you got my e-mail.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, man. Y'all is gonna have a
great time. Everybody! This here's
Finn McMissile. He's a secret
agent.
Don't tell nobody. And this is
Holley Shiftwell. She's ---

NAME: Person_4
I'm Mater's girlfriend. It's so
nice to meet you all.

NAME: Side_32
Was that from when you swooped in
and saved them in London?

NAME: Side_40
Van!

NAME: Side_32
What? I'm just asking.

NAME: Side_22
Yeah, sure thing. No problemo. Just
let me go get my tools.

NAME: Person_4
Oh no no. I'm keeping that dent.
It's way too valuable.

NAME: Side_33
A "valuable" dent? Oh, she's as
crazy as Mater.

NAME: Side_34
Those two are perfect for each
other.

NAME: Person_2
You know, there's one thing I still
don't get. The bad guys hit me with
the beam from the camera, right? So
why didn't I, you know...

NAME: Person_1
Explode in a fiery inferno?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_3
We couldn't figure that one out
either.

NAME: Person_4
Our investigation proved that
Allinol was actually gasoline. And
Miles Axlerod engineered it so that
when it got hit by the beam it
would explode.

NAME: Person_2
Wait a second. Fillmore, you said
my fuel was safe.

NAME: Side_11
If you're implying that I switched
out that rotgut excuse for
alternative fuel with my all-
natural, sustainable, organic
biofuel just because I never
trusted Axlerod, you're dead wrong,
man.
It was him.

NAME: Side_10
Once Big Oil, always Big Oil. Man.

NAME: Side_11
Tree hugger.

NAME: Side_27
The Radiator Springs Grand Prix is
about to begin! All spectators
clear the starting line!

NAME: Side_23
Man, I can't wait to get rockin'.
This is gonna be wicked.

NAME: Side_29
Yeah, we should do this every year.

NAME: Person_2
I just figured, we never found out
who the world's fastest car is.
Plus: no press, no trophy. Just
racing - the way I like it.

NAME: Person_5
Francesco likes it like this too.

NAME: Person_2
Francesco. I'd like you to meet ---

NAME: Person_5
Signorina Sally. It is official:
Lightning McQueen is the luckiest
car in the world.

NAME: Person_5
Which he will have to be to have a
chance against Francesco today.

NAME: Person_5
See you at the finish line, Mc---

NAME: Person_5
What is that?

NAME: Person_2
It's just something I had made up
for the occasion.

NAME: Person_5
Is good, McQueen. Very funny. It
was funnier when I did it, but
it's very funny. What are you going
to do next? Are you going to take
off your fenders? Try it. You'll
like it.

NAME: Side_3
So he's not so good-looking.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. Nice try.

NAME: Side_3
I'm serious.

NAME: Person_2
That's why I love you, Sally.
Wish me luck.

NAME: Side_3
You don't need it!

NAME: Side_18
Mmm-mmm. That Francesco is fine-
looking.

NAME: Side_3
And those open wheels.

NAME: Side_18
I'm gonna have to go get myself
some coolant.

NAME: Person_1
Go McQueen!! Whoo-hoo!!!

NAME: Person_4
Finn, time to go. Siddeley's
gassed, geared and ready to fly.

NAME: Person_1
You're leaving already?

NAME: Person_3
We've got another mission, Mater.
Just stopped by here to "pick
something up."

NAME: Person_1
Something tells me you're not
talking about souvenir bumper
stickers.

NAME: Person_3
Her Majesty asked for you
personally, Mater.

NAME: Person_1
But I told you all before. I'm not
a spy.

NAME: Person_4
We know.

NAME: Person_3
Spy or not, you're still the
smartest, most honest chap we've
ever met.

NAME: Person_4
Don't forget massively charming.

NAME: Person_1
Well, thanks. But as much fun as it
was hanging with y'all, this...

NAME: Person_1
This is home.

NAME: Person_4
That's alright, we understand. But
I'll be back. You still owe me that
first date.

NAME: Person_3
If there's ever anything I can do
for you, just let me know.

NAME: Person_1
Well, I sure appreciate that, thank
you.
Actually... there is one thing.

NAME: Person_1
Whoo-hoo!!!

NAME: Side_7
Whoa!!!

NAME: Person_5
Impossible!

NAME: Person_2
Mater!?

NAME: Person_2
I'll see you at the finish line,
buddy!

NAME: Person_1
Not if I see you first!

NAME: Person_5
Three weeks and we're still no
closer to cracking this?

NAME: Person_5
Right... bring him in.

NAME: Person_3
This is the best party EVER!!!

NAME: Person_7
Haha!   Yeah!

NAME: Person_3
Oh no!   A dragon is approaching!

NAME: Person_4
Fear not, for here come the gallant
knights to save us!

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no! What do you mean she's
not coming?! I have a backyard
full of these little girls who are
counting on a visit from a fairy
princess!

NAME: Person_1
Ah!   Hurts! Ah! Stop it!

NAME: Person_1
Listen! I don't want a refund! I
want a fairy princess... please!
Please, I am begging you.
You know what? I hope that you can
sleep at night, you crusher of
little girls' dreams!!!

NAME: Person_3
Ooh ooh!   When's the Fairy Princess
coming?

NAME: Person_1
Any minute now!

NAME: Person_3
Yayyy!

NAME: Person_1
Stall them.

NAME: Person_4
Whoa! Whoa! Okay, okay, alright.
That's enough of the magic show!

NAME: Side_9
Awwww.

NAME: Person_4
Wait, did you hear that? It
sounded like the twinkling sounds
of magical fairy dust.

NAME: Person_3
It's the fairy princess!   She's
coming!

NAME: Person_4
Look!

NAME: Person_1
Aaaaaahh!

NAME: Person_1
It is I, Gru...zinkerbell! The
most magical fairy princess of all!
And I am here to wish Princess
Agnes a very happy birthday!

NAME: Side_14
How come you're tho fat?

NAME: Person_1
Because my house is made of candy
and sometimes I eat instead of
facing my problems.

NAME: Side_14
How come you have-

NAME: Person_1
Okay!   Time for cake!

NAME: Person_3
Thank you, Gru-zinkerbell. You're
the best fairy princess ever!

NAME: Person_1
You are welcome, little girl.

NAME: Person_3
I know it's really you, Gru. I'm
just pretending for the other kids.

NAME: Side_5
Hey there, Gru, Mr. Life of the
Party!

NAME: Person_1
Hello, Jillian.

NAME: Side_5
Sooooo, I'm gonna go out on a limb
here, but my friend Natalie is
recently single, and...

NAME: Person_1
No, no, no, get off of the limb
right now. No limb.

NAME: Side_5
Oh, come on...she's a riot. She
sings karaoke, she has a lot of
free time, looks aren't that
important to her...

NAME: Person_1
No, Jill's, that is not happening.
Seriously. I'm fine.

NAME: Side_5
Okay, fine. Forget Natalie.        How
about my cousin Linda?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Side_5
Oh, oh! I know someone whose
husband just died!

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry.     I did not see you
there.

NAME: Person_1
Or there.

NAME: Person_1
Kyle... Kyle!

NAME: Person_1
Ky--Kyle!   No, do not do your
business on the petunias!

NAME: Person_1
There you go. Those are Fred's.
Go crazy.

NAME: Person_1
Good boy.

NAME: Person_1
Wha?   I didn't... What... Yes?

NAME: Person_2
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.
(realizes her badge is
upside down)
Oh. Whoops.
(clears her throat, all
business)
Sorry, you're gonna have to come
with me.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, sorry, I--Freeze Ray!

NAME: Person_2
You know you really should announce
your weapons after you fire them,
Mr. Gru. For example--

NAME: Person_2
Lipstick Taser! Oh, it works so
good.

NAME: Person_2
Man.    Ugh.     Large...person.

Oh...sorry!

NAME: Side_9
Whoa...

NAME: Person_1
Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh,
foot's asleep...ah...pins and
needles...

NAME: Person_1
Ehhh...

NAME: Person_5
I apologize for our methods in
getting you here.

NAME: Person_2
I don't. I'd do it again in a
heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I
enjoyed that. Every second of it.
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

NAME: Person_5
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

NAME: Person_2
Sorry, sir.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, this is bogus!

NAME: Person_1
I don't know who you people think
you are, but--

NAME: Person_5
We are the Anti-Villain League.

NAME: Person_5
An ultra-secret organization
dedicated to fighting crime on a
global scale. Rob a bank? We're
not interested. Kill someone? Not
our deal. But you want to melt the
polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt.
Fuji? Or even steal the moon?
Then we notice.

NAME: Person_1
First of all, you've got no proof
that I did that. Second, after I
did do that, I put it back!

NAME: Person_5
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.
That's why we've brought you here.
I am the League's director, Silas
Ramsbottom.

NAME: Side_10
Bottom.

NAME: Side_10 AND Side_4
Heeheheeeeheeehee.

NAME: Person_5
Hilarious.     Agent Wilde...

NAME: Person_2
Oh, me now...?

NAME: Person_2
Um, recently an entire top secret
lab disappeared from the Arctic
Circle. Yeah, the entire lab.
Just whoosh. Voom! Gone. Where
did it go?

NAME: Person_1
I don't care.

NAME: Person_2
The lab was devoted to experiments
involving PX-41, a transmutation
serum. What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmmm, it's pretty bad... Look.

NAME: Side_10 AND Side_4
Aaah!

NAME: Person_1
Oh!

NAME: Person_1
Hmm, you usually don't see that in
bunnies.

NAME: Person_5
As you can see, in the wrong hands,
the PX-41 serum could be the most
devastating weapon on earth.
(struggles to get through
the opening in the table)
Fortunately it has a very distinct
chemical footprint, and using the
latest chemtracking technology, we
found traces of it in the Paradise
Mall.

NAME: Person_1
Ha!   A mall?

NAME: Person_5
Precisely. And we believe that one
of these shop owners is a master
criminal.

NAME: Person_5
And that's where you come in. As
an ex-villain, you know how a
villain thinks, how a villain acts.

NAME: Person_2
The plan is to set you up
undercover at a shop in the mall,
where hopefully you'll be able to--

NAME: Person_1
Okay, I see where this is going,
with all the Mission Impossible
stuff, but no. No! I am a father
now. And a legitimate businessman.
I am developing a line of delicious
jams and jellies.

NAME: Person_5
Jams and...jellies?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, attitude! That's right! So
thanks, but no thanks.
And here's a tip--instead of tasing
people and kidnapping them, maybe
you should just give them a call!
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt!

NAME: Person_5
Ramsbottom.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, yeah, like that's any better!

NAME: Person_2
Look, I probably shouldn't be
saying this, but your work as a
villain was kind of amazing, so if
you ever want to get back to doing
something awesome--give us a call.

NAME: Side_10
Mack-oh! Mack-oh!    Mack-oh!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, sorry.

NAME: Person_7
So when ya goin' on your date?

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_7
Remember? Miss Jillian said she
was arranging a date for you.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And
I'm not going on any date.

NAME: Person_7
Why not?    Are you scared?

NAME: Side_11
Hey, did you guys see the moon
landing on TV?

NAME: Side_6
Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so
cool...

NAME: Side_11
Yeah, and you know what--

NAME: LITTLE Person_1
Excuse me, Lisa?

NAME: Side_11
I was talking to Billy the other
day.

NAME: Side_6
No way.

NAME: Side_11
He is so cute.

NAME: Side_11
And I think he likes me.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you--

NAME: Side_21
Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru
touched Lisa!

NAME: Side_6
Eeeeewww!

Lisa's got Grooties!

NAME: Person_1
Scared? Of what? Women?! No,
that's bonkers! I just-- I have no
interest in going on a date, that's
all. Case closed. I'm not scared--
of women... or dates... let's go to
bed.

NAME: Person_1
Goodnight, Edith.

NAME: Person_1
Goodnight, Margo.

NAME: Person_1
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Well, hold
the horses. Who are you texting?

NAME: Person_4
No one.   Just my friend Avery.

NAME: Person_1
Avery... Avery? Is that a girl's
name or a boy's name?

NAME: Person_4
Does it matter?

NAME: Person_1
No, no, it doesn't matter... Unless
it's a boy!

NAME: Person_3
I know what makes you a boy.

NAME: Person_1
Uh...oooh...you...do?

NAME: Person_3
Your bald head.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, yes...

NAME: Person_3
It's really smooth. Sometimes I
stare at it and imagine a little
chick popping out. Peep peep peep.

NAME: Person_1
Goodnight, Agnes.   Never get older.

NAME: Side_23
Hey, oh!    Me banana!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

NAME: Person_1
Donnie, hang in there, baby!    It's
almost Friday.

NAME: Person_1
So, how's today's batch, Dr.
Nefario?

NAME: Side_24
I developed a    new formula which
allowed me to    get every known kind
of berry into    one flavor of jelly.

NAME: Person_1
That tastes good...
Love the flavor of that...

NAME: Person_9
It's horrible, isn't it?

NAME: Person_1
No! No! Oh, we're making great
progress!
Here, try some of this.

NAME: Person_1
Whoa... okay, just because
everybody hates it doesn't mean
it's not good.

NAME: Person_9
Listen, Gru. There's something
I've been meaning to talk to you
about for some time now.

NAME: Person_1
What?   What's wrong?

NAME: Person_9
I miss being evil. Sinister plots,
large-scale crimes...It's what I
live for! I mean, don't you think
there's more to our future than
jelly?

NAME: Person_1
Well, I'm also considering a line
of jams...

NAME: Person_9
Um...the thing is, Gru...
I've had an offer of employment
elsewhere.

NAME: Person_1
Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're
kidding, right?

NAME: Person_9
It's a great opportunity for me,
bigger lab, more evil, full
dental...

NAME: Person_1
Very well. Let us give you the
proper send-off.
Minions!

NAME: Person_1
The highest honor awarded. To Dr.
Nefario for your years of service.
The twenty-one fart gun salute!

NAME: Person_9
Uh, I counted twenty-two.

NAME: Person_9
Farewell, my friends.

NAME: Person_9
This may take a while. Go about
your business.

NAME: Person_9
I miss you already!

NAME: Side_15
Hello?

NAME: Person_3
Are you sure we should be doing
this?

NAME: Person_4
Yes, it's for his own good.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, we need to choose a picture.

NAME: Person_3
No.

NAME: Person_3
Scary.

NAME: Person_7
Weird.

NAME: Side_6
Aaaaaah!!!

NAME: Person_3
What is that?!

NAME: Person_1
Good morning, girls! I have an
announcement to make.

NAME: Person_4
Hey, what celebrity do you look
like?

NAME: Person_1
Ummm...Bruce Willis.

NAME: Person_4
Mmmm...no.

NAME: Person_3
Humpty Dumpty!

NAME: Person_7
Ooh, Gollum!

NAME: Person_1
Okay, what are you doing?

NAME: Person_3
We're signing you up for online
dating!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, okay...WHAT?! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

NAME: Person_7
Aw come on, it's fun.

NAME: Person_4
And it's time for you to get out
there.

NAME: Person_1
No! Stop!      No one is ever getting
out there!     Ever!

NAME: Person_1
Okay, now for the announcement:    I
have accepted a new job.

NAME: Person_4
Whoa--really?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, I have been recruited by a top
secret agency to go undercover and
save the world!

NAME: Person_7
You're gonna be a spy?!

NAME: Person_1
That's right, baby! Gru's back in
the game! With gadgets and weapons
and cool cars...the whole deal.

NAME: Person_7
Awesome!

NAME: Person_3
Are you really gonna save the
world?

NAME: Person_1
Yes.   Yes I am.

NAME: Side_7
Mocha!

NAME: Side_1
Cacao!

NAME: Side_4
Papadam?

NAME: Person_1
Hm.     "Bake My Day."   Blech.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, here is the cupcake recipe
I got off the internet.

NAME: Person_1
And don't go nuts with the
sprinkles!

NAME: Person_2
Ha! Yaa!      Ho! Ooof!   Zaaa!   Ay-ay-
ay-ay-ay!

NAME: Person_2
Whoo. Wasn't expecting that.
(strikes a martial arts
pose)
Or was I?

NAME: Person_2
Ooh... you got... You got... a
little...

NAME: Person_2
Here, I'll-- I'll get it.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, that's just spreading...um...

NAME: Person_1
Alright, alright.    I got it.    I got
it!... Stop it!

NAME: Person_2
Oh!     I'll let you get it.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, what you just saw there was a
little something new I've been
working on. It's a combination of
Jujitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare,
and krumping.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, that's weird--why are you
here?

NAME: Person_2
On assignment from Silas.   I'm your
new partner. Yay!

NAME: Person_1
What?! No, no "yay." Ramsbottom
didn't say anything about a
partner.

NAME: Person_2
Well, seems that because of your
checkered past, everyone else
refused to work with you. But not
me. I stepped up. And I'm new, so
I kind of have to do what they tell
me anyway.

NAME: Side_7
Walla!

NAME: Person_2
You know this guy?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, he's one of my minions.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, I'm sorry. I should have
known.

NAME: Person_2
You're free to go.

NAME: Person_1
Earth to Dave!     You can leave now.

NAME: Person_2
First suspect...Hedda Blumentoft,
proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral
Shop.

NAME: Person_1
No.    Not her.

NAME: Person_2
Okay, moving on...

NAME: Person_2
Chuck Kinney, owner of "Stuff-A-
Bear."

NAME: Person_2
Ooh.

NAME: Person_1
I don't think so.

NAME: Person_1
Oh!

NAME: Person_6
Buenos dias, my friends! I am
Eduardo Perez, owner of Salsa &
Salsa Restaurant, across the mall.
Now open for breakfast. And you
are?

NAME: Person_1
Gru. And this is Lucy.    And we are
closed.

NAME: Person_6
This is just gonna take un momento.
I am throwing a big Cinco de Mayo
party, and I am going to need two
hundred of your best cupcakes
decorated with the Mexican flag.
It looks something like this.

NAME: Person_6
What do you think?

NAME: Person_1
Look away!

NAME: Person_2
You-- Whoa... Hooo...

NAME: Person_6
Anyway, I have to go. It's all
settled! I pick `em up next week!
Have a good day. Come by if you
get a chance, okay?

NAME: Person_6
And welcome to the mall family!

NAME: Person_1
El Macho.

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
But it couldn't be...

NAME: Person_2
Wha-- What? What couldn't be??

NAME: Person_1
That guy looks exactly like a
villain named El Macho. From about
twenty years ago.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty
dead...

NAME: Person_1
They never found the body. Oh no.
All that was ever retrieved was a
pile of singed chest hair.
But... that face. It has got to be
El Macho.

NAME: Person_2
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant?
Tonight.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, that's good, because I'm
telling you--if anybody in this
place has the PX-41 serum...

NAME: Person_1
...it's him.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, alright, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for
bed.

NAME: Person_4
What's the big hurry?

NAME: Person_1
I just... I have a lot of work to
do.

NAME: Person_7
Work, what kind of work?

NAME: Person_1
Very important business.
So...hugs, kisses...
...good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah-blah-
blah--

NAME: Person_3
But you said you'd help me
practice my part for the Mother's
Day show!

NAME: Person_1
Fine, fine... Let me hear it.
Quickly.

NAME: Person_3
She kisses my boo-boos
She braids my hair
My mother is beyond compare
We love you, mothers, everywhere!

NAME: Person_1
Wow! That was...something else. I
really liked the way you smiled at
the end. Let's try this one more
time, but a teensy bit less like a
zombie, okay?

NAME: Person_3
Okay.
She kisses my boo-boos
She braids my hair--

NAME: Person_1
Perfect!   Time to go!

NAME: Person_3
I don't think I should do this.

NAME: Person_1
Well, what do you mean?    Why not?

NAME: Person_3
I don't even have a mom.

NAME: Person_1
Well, you don't need one to do the
show. I mean, you did the Veterans
Day Pageant and you haven't been in
combat.

NAME: Person_3
This is different.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, well, then...maybe you can
just use your imagination.

NAME: Person_3
You mean I pretend I have a mom?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, right. You can do that, can't
you?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah! I do that all the time!
Thanks, Gru!

NAME: Side_9
Hey!

NAME: Person_1
Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no,
no! Hey, please!

NAME: Person_1
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for
me, okay?
Dave, Stuart--come this way. With
me! Come on!

NAME: Person_1 (O.S.)
Come on!

NAME: Side_1
Hey, putt-putt?

NAME: Side_16
Oh!

NAME: Side_1
Una, doo--
(laughs as he lowers the
golf club to Jerry's
head)

NAME: Side_1
Boca!

NAME: Side_16
Boca!

NAME: Side_1
Looka too!

NAME: Person_1
We're stealth ninjas.    We make no
sound.

NAME: Person_2
Right.   Gotcha.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, El Macho, you're going
down.

NAME: Person_2
Wait!    Wait!

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_1
What are you doing?

NAME: Person_2
I'm checking for laser beam alarm
triggers.

NAME: Person_1
It's a restaurant!

NAME: Person_2
You never know what kind of booby
traps this guy could have set.
Huh? C'mon!

NAME: Person_1
There are no booby traps!

NAME: Person_2
Ha!   Booby!

NAME: Person_2
Oh. There's a chicken. Are you
lost little guy? You must be lost!

NAME: Person_1
Ha!   Some guard dog.

NAME: Person_1
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiigh!

NAME: Person_1
Get it off of me! Get it off of
me! Get it off of me!

NAME: Person_1
I got you!

NAME: Person_2
I got it!     Ha!

NAME: Person_2
Ha!

NAME: Person_2
Oh!

NAME: Person_1
Ugh...

NAME: Person_2
What is wrong with that chicken?
Hey, that pollo? Es loco.

NAME: Person_2
No? Okay, let's go.

NAME: Person_1
You getting anything?

NAME: Person_2
No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you
can find something with these x-ray
goggles.

NAME: Person_1
Bah...

NAME: Person_1
Ahh!   Ooof!

NAME: Person_2
What's wrong? Something wrong?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, that's an image I'll never get
out of my brain. Blagh!

NAME: Person_1
I knew it!

NAME: Person_1
The serum is in here!

NAME: Person_2
Ooh, then let's get it!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, this is going to be good!
Ahh...

NAME: Person_1
A-ha!
(registering it's not the
serum)
What? It's... salsa?

NAME: Person_2
Awww man.

NAME: Person_6
Oh... somebody's going to die
tonight.

NAME: Person_6
Pollito!

NAME: Person_6
What'd they do to you? Pollito?
Can you hear me?

NAME: Side_26
Boc!

NAME: Person_6
Who would do this to such a sweet
little chicken? What? Who's
there?

NAME: Person_6
You coming out?! Or am I gonna go
in?!

NAME: Person_6
Stop!

NAME: Person_6
My eyes!

NAME: Person_2
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

NAME: Person_1
We've been spotted!    Come get us!

NAME: Side_7
Huh?
Hey!     Loo-koo-meow-plah!

NAME: Side_4
Ah!    Koom-kwat!

NAME: Person_2
Hm.   Subtle.

NAME: Person_1
Over here, over here!    Over...
here.

NAME: Person_1
Hold tight!

NAME: Person_6
I have you now!

NAME: Side_7
Rawr, rawr!

NAME: Side_4
Oh!   Oh!   Gelato!

NAME: Side_9
Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato!

NAME: Side_4
Stopa!    Stopa!!

NAME: Side_4
Hey-ho! Gelato!

NAME: Person_1
Oh.    Okay.

NAME: Person_2
See if you can get closer.
Go...go.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, what do--

NAME: Person_1
Oh no. That's not good.

NAME: Person_1
Oh! Girls! What are you doing
here?

NAME: Person_4
Well, we thought we'd come visit
you at work.
(looks at Gru and the
trash can)
So, you're saving the world in a
garbage can?

NAME: Person_1
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, there you are.   Oh, who's
this?

NAME: Person_1
Lucy, these are my girls, Margo,
Edith and Agnes. Girls, Lucy.
Lucy, girls.

NAME: Person_4
Hello.

NAME: Person_7
Hi.

NAME: Person_3
Are you single?

NAME: Person_2
Oh!   Goodness...

NAME: Person_1
Oh! Hey! I have an idea! Since
Lucy and I have lots of work to do,
why don't you girls go and explore
the mall!

NAME: Person_1
Here is some money. Go buy some
useless mall junk! Some headbands,
and--

NAME: Person_3
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

NAME: Person_1
Are you out of your gourd?    No!
She just works with me.

NAME: Person_3
Plus you love her.
You love her, you love her, you
really really love her, and you're
gonna get married, and I will be
the flower girl, and--

NAME: Person_1
Okay, stop! That is a song of
lies. I don't even like her!
Now go have fun!

NAME: Person_3
Almost forgot! Hugs!

NAME: Person_4
Good luck saving the world.   Bye!

NAME: Person_3
Bye, Gru!

NAME: Person_1
Ha, ha, ha! Kids...right?
They're...funny.

NAME: Person_2
Those girls totally adore you.       I
bet you're a fun dad.

NAME: Person_1
Huh.
I am pretty fun.

NAME: Person_3
Is that stealing?

NAME: Person_7
Not if my wish was that I would get
a lot of free coins.

NAME: Person_4
Whoa!

NAME: Side_8
Cool glasses.

NAME: Side_8
I'm Antonio.

NAME: Person_4
I'm...Margo.

NAME: Side_8
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

NAME: Person_4
Uh, sure.    I'm...Margo.

NAME: Person_4
Um...I'll catch up with you guys
later. Bye!

NAME: Person_7
Can I be the first to say...Ewwww!

NAME: Person_3
We gotta go tell Gru!

NAME: Person_1
All right, I'm going in.

NAME: Person_2
--will make a sound like this-- MEE-

NAME: Person_1
Okay! I get it!     I get it!

NAME: Side_2
It's about time you showed up...Mr.
Gru.

NAME: Person_1
You...know my name?

NAME: Side_2
When someone moves into the mall
who is follically challenged, I
make it my business to know all
about them. You are bald. And
that is bad.

NAME: Side_2
There you go, my sweet.

NAME: Person_2
I'm getting nothing so far. I
think you need to move around.

NAME: Person_1
Wow, this looks interesting.     What
is it?

NAME: Side_2
I take it you're an art lover?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, not so much.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, how about this impressive
trinket?

NAME: Side_2
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr.
Gru.

NAME: Person_2
Nothing.

NAME: Side_2
The International--

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I don't care.

NAME: Person_2
MEE-MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! Hold on.
I'm picking up something! Behind
that wall!

NAME: Person_1
Ah!    And what do we have here?

NAME: Side_2
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

NAME: Person_1
No thanks. So what's on the other
side of the wall?

NAME: Side_2
Here you are! Look at me!     Focus!

NAME: Person_2
Gru?

NAME: Side_2
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly to
irresistible.

NAME: Person_1
Date??? Boyfriend???
What???

NAME: Person_3
There she goes!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, you're so funny...

NAME: Person_7
Gross!    Look, they're in love!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that
they are...no no no, no!

NAME: Person_4
Wow.    You're so complicated.

NAME: Person_1
Margo.    What is going on here?

NAME: Person_4
Oh! Gru, se llama Antonio.       Me
llamo Margo.

NAME: Person_1
Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares.
Let's go.

NAME: Person_4
Whoa!

NAME: Person_6
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

NAME: Side_6
Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome!

NAME: Person_6
So good to see you again, mi
compadre!

NAME: Side_8
Oh, I see you have already met my
father.

NAME: Person_1
What the-- Father?!

NAME: Person_6
Si! Look at this crazy small world
we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me
get you something.

NAME: Person_1
Oh... look at you.

NAME: Person_1
Haha. He likes me!

NAME: Person_6
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is
usually very friendly.
He had a rough night.

NAME: Person_1
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

NAME: Person_6
That is a pity. Young love is
beautiful, no?

NAME: Person_1
No!
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other!

NAME: Person_6
You are right, Cabeza de Huevo!
They must get to know each other
better. Antonio, why don't you
invite your girlfriend and her
family to our Cinco de Mayo party?

NAME: Person_1
No, no, I am--

NAME: Side_6
Si!

NAME: Person_5
I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we
eliminated him as a suspect? After
the whole salsa incident?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, but there has been a new
development, and I'm telling you,
this is the guy. You need to
arrest him immediately. And his
deviously charming son. I'm pretty
sure that the son is involved, too.
The son also. You've got to get
the son.

NAME: Person_1
I think that the son is the
mastermind. There's a look.
There's a devilish look in his eyes
and I don't like it!

NAME: Person_5
Yes, but I don't really see any
evidence for--

NAME: Person_1
Evidence schmevidence! I go with
my gut, and my gut tells me that
this guy is El Macho! Lock him up!
Lock up the son. Don't forget
about the son. The kid gives me
the creeps!

NAME: Person_5
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear...

NAME: Person_2
Uh, but, on the less...
..."crazy" side of things, uh, Gru
discovered traces of the serum at
Eagle Hair Club.

NAME: Person_5
Hm...    Interesting...

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, and you know who made that
happen? Huh?
This guy. Nailed it. Amazing,
right?

NAME: Person_1
No. I mean, sure, but it's not
him. It is...
...El Macho.

NAME: Person_5
Mr. Gru.     Please--

NAME: Person_1
No.   It is him!   And I will prove
it!

NAME: Person_2
Gru, c'mon!

NAME: Person_2
He really thinks it's El Macho.
Can you tell?

NAME: Side_27
Koonga!

NAME: Person_1
Kevin, the wi-fi's out!     Kevin?

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Lance! Where the heck is
Kevin?

NAME: Person_1
Alright, we need to revisit the
number of vacation days you guys
get. I can't find anybody anymore!

NAME: Side_5 (O.S.)
I've got good news!

NAME: Side_5
I have my friend Shannon here with
me! I was thinking you two could
get some grub, you know, tear it
up! See what happens!

NAME: Person_1
Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm
not here!

NAME: Person_3
Gru's not here!

NAME: Side_5
Are you sure?

NAME: Person_3
Yes!   He just told me!

NAME: Person_3
I mean no, he didn't just tell me!

NAME: Side_5
Agnes--where is Gru?

NAME: Person_3
He's putting on lipstick!

NAME: Person_3
He's swatting at flies!

NAME: Person_3
He's...chopping his head off!

NAME: Person_3
He's...pooping?

NAME: Side_3
I have to tell you, I was so
nervous about tonight. I mean
there's just so many phonies out
there!

NAME: Person_1
Yes, I hear you.

NAME: Side_3
Oh, so do you work out?

NAME: Person_1
Well...

NAME: Side_3
I mean, obviously, you don't, but
would you consider it? Huh?

NAME: Side_3
Physical fitness is very important
to Shannon. As you can tell,
right? Huh?

NAME: Person_1
Ah.   I can tell.

NAME: Side_3
Solid.

NAME: Person_1
We are in a restaurant, you know.

NAME: Person_2
Hi.   Takeout for Lucy?

NAME: Side_29
Sure, just a sec.

NAME: Side_3
Your accent is so exotic.

NAME: Person_1
Ah. Well, thank you very much.      I
was--

NAME: Side_3
I know someone who can fix that for
you. And you'll be talking normal
in no time.

NAME: Person_1
Hahaha. Hoooo. Is it hot in here?
Oof. How's the food?

NAME: Side_3
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.      Are
you wearing a wig?

NAME: Person_1
What? Ah!
I don't think so.

NAME: Side_3
I knew it.     You're a phony.   I hate
phonies.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. What? No.      These locks are
all mine...

NAME: Side_3
No they're not! You know what I'm
gonna do? I'm gonna rip that thing
off your head and show everyone
what a bald-headed phony you are.

NAME: Person_2
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

NAME: Person_1
Hello... Hello, are you...?

NAME: Person_1
Hello, Lucy, how you doin'...?

NAME: Person_2
Wow, looks like your date's out for
the count. It's like she's been
shot with a mild moose
tranquilizer.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, I'm winking `cuz that's what
actually happened.

NAME: Side_17
`Scusi, whassa happenin' here?    She
no like?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, she's just uh--

NAME: Side_17
Oh, oh, si, si...

NAME: Person_2
Shall we take her home?

NAME: Person_2
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

NAME: Person_1
Huh, tell me about it.

NAME: Person_2
Don't worry--it can only get better
from here, right? But if it
doesn't, you can always borrow my
dart gun. I've had to use it on
one or two dates myself.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,
I think I'm good with just the one.

NAME: Person_2
Well, good night, partner.

NAME: Person_2
This was fun.

NAME: Person_1
Yes.   Surprisingly, it was.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, and uh, just between you and
me? You look much better bald.

NAME: Person_2
See you tomorrow!

NAME: Person_1
Quack!     Quack!    Quack!

NAME: Person_3
Yeah!

NAME: Person_4
So I take it the date went well?

NAME: Person_1
No!   It was horrible!

NAME: Person_1
High-five!

NAME: Person_1
Bump it.

NAME: Person_1
Mr. Ramsbottom?

NAME: Person_5
Oh, hello.

NAME: Person_1
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_5
We got him.

NAME: Person_1
Got who?

NAME: Person_5
Floyd Eaglesan! Our agents located
a secret room in his shop last
night, and uh, discovered this!

NAME: Person_5
It's empty, but we found traces of
the PX-41 serum in it. He's our
man. So somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

NAME: Side_2
I was framed! You won't get away
with this! Get your mitts off of
me! I am a legitimate businessman!

NAME: Person_1
Ah.   Alright. So...what now?

NAME: Person_5
Well, now you're free to go back to
your "business." Mmmm. Jams and
jellies. And it looks like Agent
Wilde will be transferring to our
Australian branch.

NAME: Person_1
Australia...?

NAME: Person_5
Yes. But thank you--for
everything. And by everything of
course I mean...nothing.
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

NAME: Person_2
Hey there.

NAME: Person_1
Hey.

NAME: Person_2
So...we got him.

NAME: Person_1
Yay.  That's great.
And now you're going to Australia?

NAME: Person_2
Well, it's not definite yet. Still
figuring it out. Already been
working on my accent.
Wallaby. Diggeri-doo. Hugh
Jackman.
So...um. Pretty excited...

NAME: Person_1
Great.   Well...good luck.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks. You too.
Oh. Here. I wanted to give you
this.

NAME: Person_1
Your lipstick taser?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, it's just a memento. Just,
you know, from the first time we
met.

NAME: Person_1
Oh.    Thank you, Lucy.

NAME: Person_1
Well... it looks like they need
you, so...

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, I uh, I better go.    Bye, Gru.

NAME: Person_3
I brought you an umbrella.

NAME: Person_1
Ah, thank you.

NAME: Person_3
What're you doing out here?

NAME: Person_1
Remember when you said that I liked
Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're
right.

NAME: Person_3
Really?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, but...well, she's moving away.
I'm never going to see her again.

NAME: Person_3
Is there anything I can do to help?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, I don't--I don't think so,
sweetheart.

NAME: Person_3
Well, is there anything you could
do?

NAME: Person_1
"Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know
up to this point our relationship
has been strictly professional, and
you're leaving for Australia and
all, but..."
Okay, here is the question. "Would
you like to--to go out on a date?"

NAME: Side_7
Eh, no.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, that's not helping.

NAME: Person_1
All right.     Here we go.   For real
this time.

NAME: Person_1
I can do this.

NAME: Person_1
Agh!    I hate you!

NAME: Person_1
Ah.

NAME: Side_13
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

NAME: Side_13
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo!

NAME: Side_13
Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo!

NAME: Side_1
Tom?

NAME: Side_1 & Side_15
Bello!   Compai!

NAME: Side_15
Compai!

NAME: PURPLE Side_15
Blaaah!

NAME: Side_1
Oh...

NAME: Person_4, Person_7 & Person_3
Cinco de May-yay-yo! Cinco de May-
yay-yo! Cinco de May-yay-yo!

NAME: Person_7
Whoa!   This place is awesome!

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Let's party. Ah? But first
let's go over the rules. Because
what is fun without the rules?

NAME: Person_1
Agnes, easy on the churros.

NAME: Person_1
Edith, try not to kill anyone.

NAME: Person_7
Hai!

NAME: Person_1
Margo--

NAME: Side_8
Hello, Mr. Gru.

NAME: Person_1
Aghhh!    Okay...

NAME: Person_4
Gru!

NAME: Person_1
There must be the standard six feet
of space between you and boys.
Especially this boy.

NAME: Side_8
You are a funny man. There are no
rules, Seor! It's Cinco De Mayo!
Come on! They're starting the
dance!

NAME: Person_3
Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba!

NAME: Person_6
(sensing something's
wrong)
Hey, what's wrong?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.
I'm just chilling with the
guac...from my chip hat.

NAME: Person_6
Gru, please. I know that look all
too well. It is the look of a
broken heart.

NAME: Person_1
How did you know?

NAME: Person_6
Believe me, my friend, I too have
spent many nights trying to drown
my sorrows in guacamole.

NAME: Person_1
You?

NAME: Person_8
Yes. But we are survivors.
There's much more to us than meets
the eye. Enjoy the party.

NAME: Person_1
What the--oh!

NAME: Person_1
Huh.

NAME: Person_1
Oooh!

NAME: Person_1
Aaaahhh...

NAME: Person_1
Oh!

NAME: Person_1
Aaaahhh!

NAME: Person_1
Oooohhh.

NAME: Person_1
Aha!    Ha ha ha--

NAME: Person_1
Oh!

NAME: Person_1
Ouch!

NAME: Person_2
Say what?

NAME: FEMALE Person_1 PASSENGER
Ha ha ha ha ha! That's a good
joke.

NAME: Person_1 BABY
I just did a boom boom.

NAME: Side_18
I really need you to make a choice,
hon.

NAME: Person_2
I choose Gru.

NAME: Person_2
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

NAME: Side_18
You're welcome!

NAME: Person_1
Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El
Macho!

NAME: Person_8
That's right!

NAME: Person_1
Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I
knew you weren't dead!

NAME: Person_8
Of course not. I merely faked my
death, ha, ha!
But now it's time for me to make a
spectacular return to evil!
Doctor, I think it's time we showed
Gru what we're up to here.

NAME: Person_1
Dr. Nefario?

NAME: Person_9
Nice to see you, Gru.

NAME: Person_1
Whaaat? This-- So, this is your
new job opportunity?

NAME: Person_9
Absolutely. You're gonna like
this.

NAME: Person_8
Sorry--I had to borrow some of your
minions, but it was for a worthy
cause.

NAME: Person_1
Oh!   Kevin? Agh!

NAME: Person_8
No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he
is an indestructible, mindless
killing machine!

NAME: Side_1
Blah!

NAME: Person_8
Just watch this!

NAME: Person_8
And here's the best part! I've got
an ARMY OF THEM!

NAME: Person_8
Soon I will unleash them on the
world--and if anyone, anyone,
tries to stop them...YEOW! Their
city gets eaten!
We can do it together!

NAME: Person_1
Together?

NAME: Person_8
Together! I have admired your work
for years, amigo. Stealing the
moon?! Are you kidding?! We would
be unstoppable! Men like you, men
like me, we should be ruling the
world!
So, are you in?

NAME: Person_9
Woo-hoo!

NAME: Person_1
Uh...yeah...probably...

NAME: Person_8
Probably?

NAME: Person_1
I mean, yes! Yes. Of course, yes,
I just have a lot going on right
now...I just need to get some
things off my plate before we start
taking over the world, that's all.

NAME: Person_8
`Scuse me?

NAME: Person_1
No--no, forget it! One hundred
percent! I am in!
(pretending to hear
something)
I think--what is--do you hear that--
I do. That's Agnes calling me from
on the surf--

NAME: Person_1
Totally in!

NAME: Person_8
You know what? I am not so
convinced that he is in.

NAME: Side_1
Blah!

NAME: Person_1
Edith!   Agnes!      Come on!

NAME: Person_1
Ooof!

NAME: Person_7
Sorry.

NAME: Person_1
We need to go home now!    Where's
Margo?

NAME: Person_3
But I didn't get a turn!

NAME: Person_1
Margo!

NAME: Person_1
Come on, we're leav--hey, what's
wrong?

NAME: Person_4
I hate boys.

NAME: Person_1
Yes...they stink.   Sorry, honey,
we've got to go.

NAME: Person_2
Oops, sorry!

NAME: Person_2
Oh, hey!   Eduardo!

NAME: Person_8
Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's
usually not like this. The same
thing happened the other day
with... with Gru and...

NAME: Person_2
Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you
seen him? I really need to talk to
him.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, I think he's somewhere around
here. You two are close, no?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, I don't know. I mean close...
I wouldn't say we were close. Why,
did he say we were close? Did he
say that?

NAME: Person_8
It's more what he didn't say. For
instance, he never mentioned...that
you were both working for the Anti-
Villain League!!!

NAME: Person_8
You're coming with me.

NAME: Person_2
Hey!

NAME: Person_9
Crikey.

NAME: Person_7
So Eduardo's actually El Macho?
Cool!

NAME: Person_1
No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty
much knew it was him all along, so
if anyone's cool, it's me.

NAME: Person_1
Well, Dr. Nefario...

NAME: Person_1
Lucy? Wha--that's impossible!
She's on her way to Australia...

NAME: Person_3
He's got Lucy?

NAME: Person_1
Not for long.

NAME: Person_1
Come on.
We're getting her out of there.

NAME: Person_3
What was that?

NAME: Person_4
I don't see anything.

NAME: Person_4
Run!

NAME: Person_3
My unicorn!

NAME: Person_4
Agnes, no!

NAME: Person_4
C'mon!   Hurry!

NAME: Person_3
Whoa!

NAME: Person_7
What's the matter?

NAME: Person_3
Whoa!

NAME: Side_1
Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos?

NAME: Person_3
Kevin!

NAME: Person_4
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

NAME: Person_9
In the flesh.

NAME: Person_9
Behold, the antidote!

NAME: Person_9
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused
here!

NAME: Side_9
Okay, okay.

NAME: Person_1
Curses. Foiled again. These guys
captured me.

NAME: Person_1
Run!

NAME: Person_1
Up that tree! Hurry, hurry!

NAME: Person_9
Hello, Gru!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, hey!    Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

NAME: Person_9
I put an antidote in the jelly.
I mean, I'm happy to create an evil
army to destroy the world, but
nobody messes with my family.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you, Doctor!   Now let's go
get the--

NAME: Person_3
Hi!

NAME: Person_1
You brought the girls?

NAME: Person_9
Yes!
Oh.     Was that wrong?

NAME: Person_7
Wooooo!    Yeeeaaahhh!

NAME: Person_8
Oh no! What's happening to my
minions?
Gru?

NAME: Person_1
You guys take care of the rest of
the minions.
I'm going to find Lucy.

NAME: Person_3
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!
Waaaaah!

NAME: Person_1
It's over, El Macho.   Now where is
Lucy?

NAME: Person_8
Let me show you.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, hey Gru! Turns out you were
right about the whole El Macho
thing, huh?
Yay!

NAME: Person_8
One push of this button and I send
that rocket straight into the same
volcano where I faked my death.
Only this time--it's for real!

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Side_7
Tally ho!

NAME: Person_8
We could've ruled the world
together, Gru. But now--you're
gonna die.

NAME: Person_1
Lipstick taser!

NAME: Person_2
Aw...he copied me.

NAME: Person_8
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

NAME: Person_9
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun,
sunshine.

NAME: Person_2
Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be
fine. I have survived lots worse
than this.
Okay, that's not entirely true.
I'm actually kind of freaking out
up here!

NAME: Person_1
Don't worry--I will get you out of
this!

NAME: Person_1
I really hate that chicken.

NAME: Person_2
Is there a red one?   It's usually
the red one.

NAME: Person_2
Gru, anytime now!

NAME: Person_1
Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of
this alive, so I need to ask you a
question.

NAME: Person_2
Uh, better make it quick!

NAME: Person_1
If I'd asked you out on a date,
what would you have said?

NAME: Person_2
Are you kidding me?!   Yes!

NAME: Person_1
Oh!  Lucy!
Lucy! Where are you?!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, Lucy!

NAME: Person_2
Gru!

NAME: Person_2
Sorry...I guess you kind of need
your arms to tread water, huh?

NAME: Side_10
Mack-oh! Mack-oh!      Mack-oh!

NAME: Person_1
They'll be back...

NAME: Person_7
Can I be the first to say--ewwww!

NAME: Person_3
Okay.

NAME: Person_3
Excuse me!

NAME: Person_3
Um...hi!   Excuse me!

NAME: Person_3
Uh...hi, everybody! I'd like to
make some toast. Uh...

NAME: Person_3
She um...she um, kisses my boo-boos.
She braids my hair.
We love you mothers, everywhere!

NAME: Person_3
And my new mom Lucy is beyond
compare.

NAME: Person_3
To the bride and Gru!

NAME: Side_35
Blaaaaah!

NAME: Side_4
You look so peaceful from up here.

NAME: Side_4
Looks like Roxanne's in trouble
again.

NAME: Person_8
NAME: Side_18
I hate the outfits. I mean, I get
it: we're all supposed to be
"masterminds" - very clever.
I just feel stupid. I mean, what
the hell did Einstein really do
anyway?

NAME: Person_5
Theory of relativity.

NAME: Person_8
Well, you'd think he'd invent a
wool sweater that didn't itch so
much.

NAME: Person_1
The real Einstein once said, "God
does not play dice with the world."
He was right, because the world is
MY dice. Is that understood?

NAME: Side_2 & Person_5
Sir! Yes, sir!

NAME: Person_8
Yes, sir.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, then - clean slate. Do we
have the girl?

NAME: Side_2
Yes, sir. She fell into our trap
just like you knew she would.

NAME: Person_1
Reporters are a curious lot, and
easily manipulated.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, let's not keep the lady
waiting.

NAME: Person_2
You didn't need to turn around like
that. I can recognize the stench of
failure.

NAME: Person_1
I trust you gentlemen know the very
sassy Roxanne Ritchi, highly
regarded investigative journalist
who some say has a more than
friendly relationship with our
super powered foe Uberman. And Miss
Ritchi, I trust you've already met
my new crew: The Mad Geniuses!

NAME: Person_2
Looks like a real group of winners.
At the risk of sounding cliche',
you'll never get away with this.

NAME: Person_1
In a way, I already have.

NAME: Person_2
We go through this every time. You
kidnap me to get to Uberman, he
immediately finds your hideout,
escapes whatever lame trap you've
come up with, and takes you and
your cronies to jail. I propose we
just save everybody some heartache
this time by YOU letting me go, and
ME forgetting this whole thing ever
happened?

NAME: Person_1
What about my revenge?

NAME: Person_2
We can say it was wasting
everyone's time.

NAME: Person_1
You have a wicked tongue. I hope
you rid yourself of that when
you're my queen.

NAME: Person_2
I'm sorry. What makes you think I
would want to be your queen?

NAME: Person_1
Power corrupts absolutely, Miss
Ritchi. And when I have ultimate
power over this city, I have
absolutely every intention of
corrupting you with it.

NAME: Person_5
Sir!

NAME: Person_1
What is it!?

NAME: Side_4
Master Mind!

NAME: Side_4
What's the matter, miss your old
jail cell?

NAME: Side_4
You can't possibly believe this
will work.

NAME: Person_5
We're now at minimum safe distance,
master.

NAME: Person_1
Excellent. Stop here, I like this
view.

NAME: Person_5
Twenty seconds until impact.

NAME: Person_1
Any last words?

NAME: Person_5
Ten seconds to impact.

NAME: Person_5
Nine...

NAME: Person_5
Eight...

NAME: Person_1
What's going on?

NAME: Side_4
Hold...on...a second.

NAME: Person_5
Seven...

NAME: Side_2
What did he just say?

NAME: Person_5
Six......Five...

NAME: Person_1
What kind of trick is this?

NAME: Side_4
Like you don't know. These bars are
made of copper, aren't they?

NAME: Person_5
Four...

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, so?

NAME: Side_4
You figured out my weakness, damn
you. I CAN'T BEND COPPER!

NAME: Person_5
Three...

NAME: Person_1
Your weakness is copper?

NAME: Person_5
Two...one.

NAME: Person_5
I don't think even he could have
survived that.

NAME: Person_8
Whoa! Is it me or did you just
finally destroy Uberman?

NAME: Person_1
Well...let's not get ahead of
ourselves.

NAME: Side_2
Look, there's something in the sky,
coming this way.

NAME: Person_2
Uberman!

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_2
Uberman?

NAME: Person_2
You killed him!

NAME: Person_8
You did it!

NAME: Person_1
...so I did.

NAME: Person_8
I mean, I know you always wanted
to. I mean, all the schemes all the
plots - I never thought you'd
actually be capable of it.

NAME: Person_8
This is history. Every villain and
lackey in the history of villains
and lackeys dream of this moment,
but when does it actually EVER
happen?

NAME: Person_8
Good lord...You do all realize what
we get to do now, don't you?

NAME: Person_8
We get to go on a crime wave.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, right.

NAME: Person_4
It's a sport of honor, focus and
grace. Honor the ball, focus on the
pins, release the ball not hard and
fast, but as if you were releasing
a baby dove.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, do something like that - but
center it more.

NAME: Side_20
Tell me how my form looks, honey.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, it's lookin' good. It's lookin'
REAL good.

NAME: Side_5
Now!

NAME: Side_5
You're fired. Leave your shirt and
locker key.

NAME: Person_4
Fired? Are you going to tell me
why?

NAME: Side_5
Showing up to work late. Showing up
to work late drunk. Sexually
harassing customers. Stealing from
the register.

NAME: Person_4
Vinnie, I don't know where you're
getting these accusations -

NAME: Person_4
Oh, which one do you supposedly
have here?

NAME: Side_5
This is all of them at once.

NAME: Person_4
I've got this one, Benny. So,
Cinderella. Can I help you find
your glass slipper?

NAME: Side_21
Yeah, I'm looking for a seven.

NAME: Person_4
Seven - Well, maybe I could
interest you in something in an
EIGHT. Namely, me.

NAME: Person_4
Lesbo.

NAME: Person_4
From the angle of the camera, I can
see where you might have gotten the
wrong idea. Listen, Vinnie, I don't
think you've thought this through.
If you fire me, who's gonna be
captain of the alley's bowling
team?

NAME: Side_5
Um, I don't know. Maybe somebody
who can actually bowl. You guys
have never won a game. I hired you
because you said you were on the
pro circuit.

NAME: Person_4
No, I said I WILL BE on the pro
circuit.

NAME: Side_5
Please, a loser like you will never
amount to anything.

NAME: Person_4
Wow...If that's how you feel...I
guess we should then talk about
what kind of severance I'm gonna
get.

NAME: Person_4
Hey...what about my ball?

NAME: Person_4
Thank-you!

NAME: Person_2
It's...um...It's good to be back.
Thanks for everyone's cards and
concerns. I really appreciated it -
now I'm ready to climb back on the
horse.

NAME: Person_9
Someone die or something?

NAME: Person_9
Oh, Jesus.

NAME: Person_2
It's okay.

NAME: Person_9
Come on into my office, sweetie.

NAME: Person_9
Can we get this woman some water
for God's sake?
I gave you two months off. What're
you doing back? People are gonna
think I'm a slave driver.

NAME: Person_2
Aren't you?

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, but I don't want people to
think it.

NAME: Person_2
Frank, listen. I want to go back to
work. I NEED to go back to work.

NAME: Person_9
...You're hysterical, aren't you?

NAME: Person_2
What're you doing?

NAME: Person_9
Keeping you warm before you go into
shock.

NAME: Person_2
It was a traumatic experience. Yes,
everyone knows Uberman and me
were...close. But what I really
need - what would really make me
better is getting back to work.

NAME: Person_9
Well, that's going to be...

NAME: Person_2
I thought you'd be happy to have me
back.

NAME: Person_9
Oh, we are. Honey, nothing makes us
happier than to have our girl back,
but...

NAME: Person_2
Yes?

NAME: Person_9
Things have sorta...changed.

NAME: Person_2
In three weeks?

NAME: Person_9
Listen, I'm not one who likes to
open up wounds - especially ones
that are just starting to scab, but
you were sorta our go to girl for
the exclusive on Uberman. And now
that he's gone...I moved Brad into
your anchor spot.

NAME: Person_2
Brad? Brad Helms? The man is an
idiot.

NAME: Person_9
It's the suits. They think it's
time to switch things up.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, because they can't use me to
get the big story.

NAME: Person_9
C'mon, Roxie. Using is in the
nature of what we do. They used
you, you used Uberman. Everybody's
happy.

NAME: Person_2
I didn't use him.

NAME: Person_9
Oh, I didn't mean that. I know you
two were in love or something. My
bad.

NAME: Person_2
We were.

NAME: Person_9
And that's great.

NAME: Person_2
Very in love.

NAME: Person_2
Okay. So, where are they going to
move me if Brad has my spot?

NAME: Person_9
...Human interest.

NAME: Person_2
Bake sales and pet stories.

NAME: Person_9
I told them I wouldn't be surprised
if you just upped and quit. You
busted your ass for that desk.

NAME: Person_2
I'll take it.

NAME: Person_9
What?

NAME: Person_8
Just robbed the diamond exchange.

NAME: Person_1
Great, great. Put it on the pile.

NAME: Person_8
Anything else today?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Person_5
Sir, the new reactor is installed.

NAME: Person_5
Do you want to throw the switch? I
know how you love to start
reactors.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe later.

NAME: Person_1
What is it, Plato?

NAME: Person_5
Sir, I can't help but notice that
you've been...a little down lately.

NAME: Person_1
When I want your opinion I'll beat
it out of you.

NAME: Person_5
Yes, sir, I know, but please
forgive my impertinence. It's just
that you seem to have lost your
lust for our profession. You've
stopped going on jobs and spend
most of your time watching Uberman
specials.

NAME: Person_1
I have defeated my greatest enemy.
I have free reign over Metro City.
I have more wealth than a thousand
Sultans. I've achieved all I have
worked for...so why am I so
unhappy?

NAME: Person_1
NAME: 2Side_18
I mean, my father, god rest his
evil and tormented soul, raised me
straight from the test tube to be a
symbol of evil.
And, I have accomplished something
he had only dreamed about - the
destruction of Metro City's
champion. I tell you, I've always
lived with this unquenchable
thirst. I thought it was to make
him proud or to get absolute power.
But now that I've pretty much
accomplished both, I am at a loss.

NAME: Person_5
...I sort of have a theory about
all that.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, really?

NAME: Person_5
Well, for one thing, maybe Uberman
was more important to you than you
thought.

NAME: Person_1
He was a worthy rival. Sometimes I
wonder, did he consider me his evil
equal or was I just an annoying,
little gnat to him? ...What's the
second part?

NAME: Person_5
I think you sort of have a thing
for Roxanne Ritchi.

NAME: Person_5
Sir, your plans always involve Ms.
Ritchi either being kidnapped or
placed in danger. If that's not
love, I don't know what is. It's
the grown up equivalent of dipping
her pigtails in the ink well. Don't
you see? She's the one treasure
that's always escaped you.

NAME: Person_2
I just wanted to get back to work.

NAME: Person_2
I keep trying to tell people it
wasn't really like that. Uberman
and I - We were kinda having
problems. We broke up.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe someone who's a little more
aware of his faults. Someone a
little more sensitive.

NAME: Person_2
Well, until he miraculously comes
walking into my life, I'm just
going to take a little reflection
time for myself.

NAME: Person_1
Who the hell is John Cusack?

NAME: Side_12
The Fifth Avenue Renovation
Project, which I championed, will
breath new life into the downtown
area. New life means new jobs and
new revenue.

NAME: Person_2
Councilman, is it true that your
brother-in-law's construction
company won the contract for this
project?

NAME: Side_12
Well...er...yes, but...look I'm not
here to answer a lot of crazy
questions...

NAME: Side_23
Thank you! Thank you for saving me
and my baby!

NAME: Person_4
(not knowing what she's
talking about)
Huh?

NAME: Person_4
There, there.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, we better...well, I hear
these little guys smother easy.

NAME: Person_2
What's it feel like to be a hero?

NAME: Person_4
Well...I'm just a man doing what
men do. You're Roxanne Ritchi,
aren't you?

NAME: Side_8
Were you scared?

NAME: Person_4
Scared? Who had time?

NAME: Person_1
John Cusack, huh? So all I have to
do is have a cute puppy dog stare,
be willing to make a fool of myself
and - Oh, REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS.

NAME: Person_1
Please, get a hold of yourself.

NAME: Person_2
Shit.

NAME: Person_7
Oh the humanity - it was a Venti.

NAME: Person_2
You're...you're.

NAME: Person_7
Yes, it's me. John Cusack...the
actor.

NAME: Person_7
Hey, is that Shelly? Wait, I think
remember something from that one -
Let's see: "My head is screaming `I
want you and need you' - my heart
it keeps reaching to see you and
feel you - yet in the end, I'm
alone once again." Wow, I scare
even myself. I'm sorry. I'm just
really into poetry. Probably
because I'm so sensitive and always
going to great lengths to express
myself. But enough about me. Can I
fill you up?

NAME: Person_2
...Yes.
I mean, excuse me?

NAME: Person_7
Can I fill you up? Your coffee.

NAME: Person_2
Right.

NAME: Person_2
I did have a boyfriend - until
fairly recently.

NAME: Person_2
I'm sorry - this is so surreal!

NAME: Person_7
Yeah, they charge way too much at
these places - Now back to your
boyfriend. I'm interested and
compassionate. I want to know about
you.

NAME: Person_2
Things were complicated. He was a
man married to his work. There
was...there was a lot of
competition in his line of
business. I'm sure you know what
that's like.

NAME: Person_7
Sure. In my business, one thing I
have is RIVALS. For example, mine
is...uh...Lou Ferr...igno.

NAME: Person_2
...The body-builder who used to
play The Hulk on TV?

NAME: Person_7
Did he? Well, we're always up for
the same roles. Did your boyfriend
have someone like that? A
particular rival that was always
getting his goat - so to speak?

NAME: Person_2
Well...one rival in particular
seemed to get more of his attention
than I ever did. But enough about
my problems.

NAME: Person_7
NAME: Side_24
I'm sorry. I got a whooping cough.
Had it ever since Serendipity. I
again. Please, go on.

NAME: Person_2
Right, well, he seemed to need him
more than he needed me.

NAME: Person_7
How do you mean?

NAME: Person_2
It was conflict he thrived on. He
always said he wouldn't know what
to do with himself if Master - I
mean, this guy were gone. It was
like he needed it, like oxygen.

NAME: Person_7
I think I finally understand...The
only logical answer is to recreate
that rivalry - or if that's
impossible, create one of equal
structure. That's it!

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_7
Oh, sorry, sorry. Just rehearsing
for a part...where I play a man who
talks to himself at inappropriate
times.

NAME: Person_7
I have to go right now, but I'd
really like to see you again - if
that's alright.

NAME: Person_2
I'd love that.

NAME: Person_8
Got her nose!

NAME: Person_1
I've got it!

NAME: Person_1
I've got it!

NAME: Person_1
It's plain and simple.
Extraordinary minds need
extraordinary stimulation. Without
that stimulus they wither and die.
Therefore, there is only one
logical conclusion: I must create a
new superhero.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, maybe that's not such hot
idea...

NAME: Person_1
Prepare for Operation Superhero
Genesis!

NAME: Person_1
Prepare the subject.

NAME: Person_1
Plato, pour the toxic waste.

NAME: Person_1
Drainage.

NAME: Person_1
Well, Severs?

NAME: Side_25
I feel fine. Just a little sticky,
but aside from that everything's
completely -

NAME: Person_1
Okay then.

NAME: Person_1
And this one?

NAME: Person_5
We attached gills to him. He can
breath under water.

NAME: Person_1
Ah. Does he have extraordinary
strength?

NAME: Person_5
Well...no.

NAME: Person_1
Can he fly?

NAME: Person_5
No.

NAME: Person_1
Resilient to weapons fire?

NAME: Person_5
No.

NAME: Person_1
He just breathes under water, then.

NAME: Person_5
Ah...yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Plato, the radioactive spider,
please.

NAME: Side_13
Ow!

NAME: Person_1
Anything, Stenwick?

NAME: Side_13
No. Ah...sir, I didn't know this
was about spiders. I have a pretty
severe case of arachnophobia.

NAME: Person_1
We're gonna need more venom.

NAME: Person_1
How `bout now, Stenwick?
....Stenwick?

NAME: Person_1
This has proven to be a challenge.
I just don't know what I want. What
do I want?

NAME: Person_1
I want a man of moral fiber with a
strong sense of right and wrong.
Someone who doesn't seek power -
instead, they must have it thrust
upon them and find, within
themselves, the courage to rise to
the occasion.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, well, it sounds like what you
want is Uberman.

NAME: Person_1
That's it! Why make a copy when the
real thing will do?

NAME: Person_8
I was just kidding, sir. In case
you forgot, you actually burned
Uberman alive.

NAME: Person_1
Then we'll make a new one. Plato,
bring me the box!

NAME: Person_1
Behold - Uberessence. The very
thing that gave Uberman his
superhuman powers.

NAME: Person_8
Where the hell did you get that?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, I shot him with a power sucking
gun and had this idea to use this
to clone a whole army of evil
Ubermen. I'm not sure why I never
got around to following up with
that.

NAME: Person_5
I believe he defeated you before
you could, master.

NAME: Person_1
...Right. Man, he was good!

NAME: Side_2
You want another volunteer, sir?

NAME: Person_1
Not another volunteer driven by the
need for personal gain. Somebody
else, somebody pure.

NAME: NEWS Side_8
...who risked his own life to save
that of a young mother and her
child.

NAME: Person_4
Please, please, you're embarrassing
me. I saw someone in need and I
helped them. What more can we ask
of ourselves. I ask you, what more?

NAME: Person_1
Somebody like him!

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, sir. This guy is a real piece
of work. He used to teach bowling
at Kingpin's.

NAME: Person_1
A modest profession to brilliantly
hide his true heroic nature. I love
it.

NAME: Person_5
Then you are absolutely going to
love this -

NAME: Person_5
- He volunteers at a school for the
blind.

NAME: Person_1
He volunteers. He doesn't ask for
any reward for his deeds. The fates
are shining down on me. This Mr.
Stewart is truly an unselfish soul.

NAME: Person_4
You greedy little bastard. I
already gave you a twenty.

NAME: Side_10
Hey, you want me to play along?
Then pay up, bitch!

NAME: Person_4
Fine, but you better be convincing.

NAME: Person_4
Here she comes, go to work.

NAME: Side_10
Why can't I see! Why God?

NAME: Person_4
Hey, Peter. C'mon champ, let me
look at you.

NAME: Person_4
You know, in life we're all given
no more than we can bear. This
happened to you maybe because you
were meant to rise above it - Maybe
to be an inspiration to the other
little Peteys out there.

NAME: Side_10
You really think so, Hal?

NAME: Person_4
Hey, does it LOOK like I'm lying?
Now c'mon, go feel your way to
class before you get your little
butt suspended.

NAME: Person_4
Petey, wait a minute.

NAME: Person_4
Don't run into anything!

NAME: Person_5
I think I've seen enough, sir. This
is your guy.

NAME: Person_4
(obviously playing it up
for the woman's benefit)
Oh, there it is again. This is
really getting embarrassing now.

NAME: ATTRACTIVE   Side_21
Oh my God! It's you!   You're the man
who saved that woman   and her baby
the other day! It is   you, isn't it?

NAME: Person_4
Oh, crap. You got me.

NAME: ATTRACTIVE Side_21
Hey, you're on TV again.

NAME: Side_3
This just in. Upon a second look at
that tape from this morning, which
we'll now replay for you, it
appears it was not the heroic act
it first seemed to be.

NAME: Side_3 (O.S.)
With the tape slowed down you can
actually see the man push the woman
and her child out of the way in an
effort to save his own life.

NAME: Person_4
I guess that looks kinda bad.

NAME: Side_2
There he is, boss.

NAME: Person_1
Now, we're sure this won't kill
him?

NAME: Person_5
Yes, sir. He'll just feel a slight
electrical shock.

NAME: Person_1
Good.

NAME: Person_1
Slight electrical shock?

NAME: Person_4
God, I hate the weather in this
city.

NAME: Person_1
Follow him.

NAME: Side_14
You don't look so good, man.

NAME: Person_4
I don't feel good. I was struck by
freaking lightening.

NAME: Person_4
AAAAAAHHHHH! You can talk?

NAME: Side_14
No, you're just hallucinating. By
the way, we're out of orange juice.

NAME: Person_4
Man...

NAME: Person_4
Oh, God!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, God!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, God!

NAME: Person_4
Wait!

NAME: Person_4
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

NAME: Person_4
Something's not right here.

NAME: Person_4
Wake up! Wake up, Hal!

NAME: Person_4
Okay, okay. Let's get it together,
man.

NAME: Person_4
This is just some sort
of...episode. It will pass, it will
pass.

NAME: Person_4
Well, not too fast I hope.

NAME: Person_4
Yes, fast, fast!

NAME: Person_4
I think I need to go home.

NAME: Person_1
Welcome to your second birth, Hal
Stewart.

NAME: Person_1
Instruction is very important in
the formative years. Every hero
needs a mentor, a father figure to
look up to.

NAME: Person_6
Perfect.

NAME: Person_4
Who are you!?

NAME: Side_30
I am the guide on your journey.
Fate has chosen you to be it's
champion.

NAME: Person_4
Thank God. It was a dream. Man, I
must be losing it.

NAME: Person_4
Jesus! This isn't happening, this
isn't happening.

NAME: Person_6
Calm. All things must be filtered
through calmness.

NAME: Person_4
Bullshit! Sometimes it's best to
freak out.

NAME: Person_6
I think we must work on your
attitude first.

NAME: Person_4
Look I'm gonna call the cops in
about two seconds if you don't get
out of here.

NAME: Person_6
Are you calm now?

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, I'm okay.

NAME: Person_6
Good, because we've got a lot of
work to do.

NAME: Person_4
What the hell was that for?

NAME: Person_6
Rule number one: expect the
unexpected.

NAME: Person_4
Can you just tell me what this is
all about?

NAME: Person_6
The heavens are not in the habit of
bestowing a gift such as this to
just anyone. You are being rewarded
for being a man of great moral
fortitude with an unwavering belief
in humanity.

NAME: Person_4
That's me alright.

NAME: Person_6
I am to train you so you may
fulfill your destiny to defeat the
great menace to Metro City: Master
Mind.

NAME: Person_6
Come.

NAME: Person_4
We're are we going?

NAME: Person_6
To train.

NAME: Person_6
Strength is just as much in the
mind as it is the muscle. Remember,
both need to be exercised.

NAME: Person_6
Hey, Corky? You listening?

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, work both muscles.

NAME: Person_6
Trust me.

NAME: Person_4
What are you doing!?

NAME: Person_6
An invulnerability test. Something
wrong?

NAME: Person_4
Uh...yeah. I would prefer not to
get shot. Do not fire that thing!

NAME: Person_6
You're bulletproof.

NAME: Person_4
Okay, do you know that for sure?

NAME: Person_6
I do now.

NAME: Person_4
You suck.

NAME: Person_4
Ice Man, I got a bogie on my tail.
Two Russian Migs coming in hard and
fast.

NAME: Person_6
Hey!

NAME: Person_4
What?

NAME: Person_6
What did I tell you? Stomach down,
hands up.

NAME: Person_4
God, I feel so gay.

NAME: Person_6
What is it?

NAME: Person_6
Yes, it's John Cusack.

NAME: Person_6
...As did I.

NAME: Person_6
I'd love to!

NAME: Person_6
I mean, I AM a little hungry.

NAME: Person_6
Sure!

NAME: Person_4
WHOOOOA! Man, that is so cool. It's
like fly - Oh my God, I almost said
it was like flying.

NAME: Person_6
For the rest of the day I want you
to continue to practice your flying
posture.

NAME: Person_4
Why, where're ya going?

NAME: Person_6
...To do something...mysterious
...and Asian.

NAME: Person_4
Say no more, bro. I'll just keep at
it, then.

NAME: Person_2
How's your sandwich?

NAME: Person_7
It's quite delicious.

NAME: Person_2
Hope you don't think I'm too
forward. Some men are intimidated
when a woman asks them out. I just
find you really easy to talk to.

NAME: Person_7
And I you.

NAME: Person_2
You know, you're not at all like
you are in the movies.

NAME: Person_7
I'm not?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. I don't know - You have this
strange, refined way of speaking.

NAME: Person_7
I do? That is most interesting.

NAME: Person_2
Anyway, when we were talking the
other day I just felt, even though
we only talked for a couple of
hours, that we've known each other
for years.

NAME: Person_7
I know just what you mean.

NAME: Person_2
You know what? This sandwich is
disgusting.

NAME: Person_2
Of course I already ate half of it.
I wonder what that says about my
character?

NAME: Person_7
It means you don't give up on a
sandwich. You see that it has
potential, and you give it every
chance to be all it can be.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks, but knowing me, I was
probably projecting my expectations
of what a lunch should be on the
sandwich. It might have been okay
at first, but I just made it
bitter.

NAME: Person_7
Is that what happened with your
last sandwich - I mean, boyfriend?

NAME: Person_2
When I look back, I probably
shouldn't of expected so much from
him. He was already a giving
person. You know, one of those go
out and save the world types.

NAME: Person_7
I've run into a few.

NAME: Person_2
I was selfish, I guess. I didn't
want to share him with anybody
else.

NAME: Person_7
It sounds like he was a special
man.

NAME: Person_2
They broke the mold.

NAME: Person_7
Perhaps not.

NAME: Person_3
What's the "T" stand for?

NAME: Person_6
Titan.

NAME: Person_3
What's that supposed to mean?

NAME: Person_6
It's from Roman mythology. Zeus's
father...oh, just go with it. You
look perfect.

NAME: Person_3
I don't think this mask is big
enough. Are you sure no one is
gonna recognize me?

NAME: Person_6
It's fine, just don't slouch. It's
all in the posture.

NAME: Person_6
It is time.

NAME: Side_31
Alright folks, this is a robbery.
Nobody moves - yadda, yadda,
yadda...

NAME: Side_11
The safe. Let's go.

NAME: Side_6
Okay, just don't hurt anyone.

NAME: Side_11
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

NAME: Person_3
Well, boys, there's no need for all
this just to get the free toaster.

NAME: Side_32
What are you suppose to be?

NAME: Person_3
Justice.

NAME: Side_11
Well, justice, suck on this...

NAME: Person_3
Now it's my turn.

NAME: Person_3
Hey, George, here comes the sun.

NAME: Person_3
Say, Paul, your mother should
know...that you're a scumbag.

NAME: Person_3
John, all you need is love...

NAME: Person_3
...and a good urologist.

NAME: Person_4
Well, Ringo...um...um...you're
under arrest.

NAME: Side_6
On behalf of the First National
Bank of Metro City, I'd like to
offer you a reward for your act of
bravery.

NAME: Person_3
Ten thousand dollars!

NAME: Person_3
I...can't except this. Law and
order is it's own...um...reward.

NAME: Side_3
This story's mine.

NAME: Person_2
Listen, Brad. We were just in the
area. I was just trying to -

NAME: Side_3
I've been in this business long
enough to know pretty well what you
were "just trying to do." Besides,
I heard you couldn't take the big
game anymore and were put on fluff
detail?

NAME: Side_33
You're not gonna take that from
him, are you?

NAME: Person_2
He's right. Old habit, I guess.
We'll get out of your way.

NAME: Side_3
Besides, I'm sure there's a pancake
supper somewhere that needs
covering.

NAME: Side_3
For months now, since the death of
Uberman, the citizens of Metro City
have been holding out for a hero.
Well, it appears they won't have to
hold out for much longer as a new
costumed crusader has suddenly
stormed onto the scene. Today, at
the Metro Savings and Trust, a
masked mystery man single-handedly
defeated "The Fab Four Gang." Just
who is this new caped avenger?

NAME: Side_3
I'm sure all of our viewers are now
wondering, what's the "T" stand
for?

NAME: Person_3
It's a message to all the scum out
there. Uberman may be gone, but
Metro City has a new protector, and
his name is "Tighten!"

NAME: Side_8
How do you spell that?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, for heaven's sake. I can't
believe it. He misspelled his name.

NAME: Person_1
No matter, I suppose.

NAME: Person_1
We've now fully established Titan
as Metro City's hero. They will
love him just as they loved
Uberman. Everything is going
according to plan.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, if the plan is getting us in
jail.

NAME: Person_1
You know, Einstein, maybe I should
have called you Socrates. He also
didn't know when to keep his
thoughts to himself.

NAME: Person_8
I just fail to see the point in all
of this. I mean, why are we
creating another superhero when it
was such a pain in the ass for you
to get rid of the other one? I
mean, Uberman is destroyed, we
should be using this opportunity
to...to...

NAME: Person_1
To what?

NAME: Person_8
I don't know. To take over the
weather, space, the world -
whatever super villains are
SUPPOSED to do.

NAME: Person_1
The reason someone like you will
always be a minion is because you
have no foresight. We take over the
earth, like you said. Then what?
Women? Cars? Money? Even the
grandest treasures will lose their
lustre if you don't have someone to
hold them over.

NAME: Person_8
That's it! This balance of the
force bullshit is getting way too
Oprah for me. I'm blowing. Who's
with me?

NAME: Person_1
You dare?

NAME: Person_8
Yeah, I dare. I'm sick of wearing
stupid costumes, and I'm sick of
working for a super villain who's
turning into a softie.

NAME: Person_1
What - did - you - call me?

NAME: Person_8
You heard me. You used to be an
inhuman monster, now look at you.
You're creating super heroes, you
don't go with us on robberies
anymore, it's been days since you
threatened anyone, oh, and not to
mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing.

NAME: Person_1
THAT is none of your business,
knave!

NAME: Person_8
Hey, you guys haven't sealed the
deal yet, have you?

NAME: Person_1
Silence!

NAME: Person_8
Oh, Master, your head is so big.

NAME: Person_1
I'm warning you, Einstein.

NAME: Person_8
Take me!

NAME: Person_1
I said silence!

NAME: Person_1
Get out of my sight.

NAME: Person_2
Don't get me wrong, I love being a
reporter. I don't think I could do
anything else. It's the
consequences of what we do that I'm
having a problem with.

NAME: Person_7
That's where journalistic
responsibility comes in, no?

NAME: Person_2
It's supposed to.

NAME: Person_7
Sounds to me like you're running
from something.

NAME: Person_2
I got someone I cared about killed.
If it wasn't for me, he wouldn't
have been involved.

NAME: Person_7
You can't blame yourself. My father
used to say each of us must answer
the great call to truly feel alive.

NAME: Person_2
Was he an actor?

NAME: Person_7
...No. He was...a landscaper. And a
horrible one. I mean he would fail
time and time again at
his...landscaping. And sometimes
he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown
in jail -

NAME: Person_2
Jail?

NAME: Person_7
My point is he took the good with
the bad. He grew a little each
time. Improved, learned.

NAME: Person_2
Was he ever successful?

NAME: Person_7
God, no...but don't let deter you.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks for this. You know, this is
embarrassing, but it's been a long
time since I -

NAME: Person_2
I think it's starting to rain. We
might want to find a table inside.

NAME: Person_7
What were you gonna say?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, I was gonna say...It's been a
long time since...well, I've been
with someone I...enjoy being with.

NAME: Person_7
To people who enjoy being with each
other.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, no. Don't look at me.

NAME: Person_7
Okay, never mind that. Now, where
were we?

NAME: Person_2
Oh my God.

NAME: Person_1
You're not gonna get all freaky
about this, are you?

NAME: Person_2
This...this is too much, even for
you. God, I go out with you, tell
you my innermost thoughts.

NAME: Person_1
I only did this because I wanted to
talk to you on the same level. You
know, without all the baggage?

NAME: Person_2
Baggage? You burned my boyfriend
alive, you sick son-of-a-bitch!

NAME: Person_1
You see, that's exactly what I'm
talking about.

NAME: Person_1
Roxanne!

NAME: Person_2
Stay away from me.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_1
Stupid. What was I thinking? Plato,
it's his fault. He's the one who
sent me on this weak-willed path.
I'll filet his scrotum for this.
Me, a creature of evil, in love
with Roxanne Ritchi. Preposterous.
I hardly give such matters thought

NAME: Person_1
I should just go up there and just
lay it all out to her. "Roxanne, I
like you - I always have. Oh, and
I'm sorry I blew up your ex.
(realizing the absurdity of his
words) Yeah, that would go over
like a pants-less clown at a
child's birthday party. What the
hell am I even doing here? Who
cares what she thinks? I'm a
supervillain and here I am acting
like a love struck schoolboy.
Forget this. I control my own
destiny!

NAME: Person_1
Perfect.

NAME: Person_2
Damn.

NAME: Person_2
Please be open.

NAME: Person_2
Thank God.

NAME: Person_2
A pack of Lady Strikes, please.

NAME: Person_1
Hello, Triple A?

NAME: Person_1
I'll call you back.

NAME: Side_15
Hey!

NAME: Side_7
Shut up, Gramps.

NAME: Side_7
Gimme that necklace!

NAME: Person_2
I don't think so.

NAME: Side_7
I said give it to me!

NAME: Side_7
What the hell's that? A super
soaker?

NAME: Person_1
No, it's a goo gun.

NAME: Side_7
Yeah, what's it do?

NAME: Person_1
It goos.

NAME: Person_1
It's...a prototype.

NAME: Side_15
I know you! You Master Brain guy.
You a hero.

NAME: Person_1
Don't - EVER - say that again.

NAME: Person_2
Hey!

NAME: Person_2
Are you following me or something?

NAME: Person_1
Don't flatter yourself.

NAME: Person_2
Don't walk away from me when I'm
talking to you.

NAME: Person_2
What a minute...all that stuff you
use to say to me when Uberman was
alive - about me being the loyal
queen by your side as you rule over
Metro City. That wasn't just super
villain rhetoric, was it? You
actually meant it!

NAME: Person_1
My, someone has a rather high
opinion of themselves.

NAME: Person_2
Do you really think I would be with
someone like you?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Person_5
Everything alright, sir?

NAME: Person_1
Fine, why do you ask?

NAME: Person_5
You...just...seem...

NAME: Person_1
Go on.

NAME: Person_5
...distracted.

NAME: Person_1
Just with business, my minion. Just
with business. I've decided it is
time.

NAME: Person_5
You mean?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, we've created our hero, now
it's time to give him a little
motivation.

NAME: Side_2
How do we do that?

NAME: Person_1
To be simply good is not enough. A
hero must be driven by an almost
relentless desire to right a wrong
that can never be corrected.

NAME: Person_5
You mean?

NAME: Person_1
Yes, he must lose someone near and
dear to him - his father figure.
Gentlemen, it's time for Operation
Mentor Kill!

NAME: Person_3
Man, what the hell happened down
there? Wait a sec -

NAME: Person_3
Crap.

NAME: Person_3
You okay?

NAME: Person_6
I'm dying, kid. There is just one
last lesson I have for you. It is
the most important of all.

NAME: Person_3
What's that?

NAME: Person_6
Master Mind did this, you must
avenge me.

NAME: Person_3
Master Mind? Why?

NAME: Person_6
Because he's evil. You must stop
the evil Hal - stop the...

NAME: Side_8 1
Tighten, Is this the work of Master
Mind?

NAME: Side_8 2
How will the death of your mentor
affect your resolve?

NAME: Side_8 3
Was that Pat Morita?

NAME: Person_3
This injustice will not go
unpunished. Master Mind, if you can
hear me, Tighten is coming for you.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, people, we don't have much
time. Titan should be here any
minute, so let's get the lead out.

NAME: Person_1
How's the death ray coming?

NAME: Side_2
Nearly up to full power, sir.

NAME: Person_1
Hum. Let's turn it down a few
notches. It's his first time and
we don't want to get in a lucky
shot, now do we?

NAME: Person_1
Anything on the radar yet?

NAME: Person_5
Not yet, sir.

NAME: Person_1
I see. Well, he must be planning
something big. Are the flame
androids deployed?

NAME: Person_5
All twelve.

NAME: Person_1
Wonderful, wonderful. Plato, Da
Vinci, take your places next to me.

NAME: Person_1
No slouching.

NAME: Person_5
He's certainly taking his time.

NAME: Person_1
He'll be here. That's the way it
works.

NAME: Person_1
Unprofessional, that's what this
is. No, it's disrespect for the
craft.

NAME: Person_1
Would Uberman have kept us waiting
like this? Of course not. He was a
pro who knew the score. It's time
we spelled out a few things for
this Titan. I will not be made a
fool of.

NAME: Person_3
Oh, for crying out loud.

NAME: Person_1
Do you know who I am?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, you're Master Mind. Yeah!
You're actually the guy I want to
see!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, so NOW you want to get down to
it. Well, I want to get a few
things off my chest first.

NAME: Person_1
Of all the inconsiderate - Do you
have any idea how long we waited
for you? We're you even planning on
coming to me and getting revenge?

NAME: Person_3
Well, at first I was going to. You
know, because that's what I figured
I was supposed to do. But then I
got to thinking-

NAME: Person_1
-You got to thinking? There's
nothing to think about. I'm the
villain. I do something bad, you
come and get me.

NAME: Person_3
- I got to thinking...what's the
point?

NAME: Person_1
Maybe you're right. What's the
point?

NAME: Person_1
What are these?

NAME: Person_3
That's what I wanted to talk to you
about.

NAME: Person_1
Where did you get all this?

NAME: Person_3
Get this: I stole them.

NAME: Person_1
From where?

NAME: Person_3
From all over. You see, once you
killed Pat and ruined my other
apartment building I was pretty
pissed off, so I figured I'd go,
find you and kick some ass. Then I
thought to myself: "Okay,then
what?" I mean, if we were to fight,
what would I get out of it? Would I
get my apartment back? Would I be
able to pay the bills?

NAME: Person_1
Well, what about your mentor?

NAME: Person_3
Tell you the truth? He was kind of
a dick. I mean, being a hero is
dandy and all, but it's volunteer
work. Now you've always had the
right take on all this. I mean,
when you rob a bank or take over
the diamond exchange you get
something out of it. I mean, when
you don't get caught, which, no
offense, isn't very often. And that
brings me to what I wanted to
propose to you: Who could catch you
if I'm by your side?

NAME: Person_1
You want to team-up?

NAME: Person_3
You got the brains, I got the
brawn. We could even call ourselves
that: `Brain' and `Brawn'. Look at
this.

NAME: Person_3
I even designed us some new
costumes.

NAME: Person_3
See, you'd be brain, so you got a
little one on your costume, and
then I'll have brawn on mine...once
I figure out the best, you know,
visual interpretation of it. What
do you think?

NAME: Person_1
What do I think?

NAME: Person_1
I think you're probably the biggest
idiot I've ever met. I mean, I
can't believe you. All your gifts,
all your powers, and all you want
to use them for is your own
financial fulfillment. You know
what? Your kind of people make me
sick.

NAME: Person_3
I worked hard on this.

NAME: Person_1
Oh - gee - I am so sorry!

NAME: Person_1
Of all the people to pick, it had
to be this loser.

NAME: Person_3
Now, hold on. You're going a little
too far.

NAME: Person_1
I wish your mother said that to
your father the night of your
conception, they would have saved
me a whole lot of heartache.

NAME: Person_3
Hey, I mean it.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, yeah? What are you gonna do?

NAME: Side_2
Master!

NAME: Side_2
What hurts?

NAME: Person_1
It!

NAME: Person_3
I don't need you, I don't need
anybody. I have the power to do and
take anything I want. And now, I'm
gonna take back everything this
city owes me. Beware Metro City,
it's time for Titan to collect.

NAME: Person_3
Oh, and from now on - I'M GONNA FLY

NAME: Side_2
How'd the plan go, boss?

NAME: Person_1
I just made myself redundant, old
friend.

NAME: Side_2
It's not that bad.

NAME: Side_9
Morning, Tighten.

NAME: Person_3
Morning.

NAME: Side_9
Is there something we can do for
you?

NAME: Person_3
Oh, don't bother about me. I'm just
here to make a withdrawal.

NAME: Side_6
Say, did he just rob us?

NAME: Side_9
Not sure. Sort of looks it, don't
it?

NAME: Side_6
Yeah.

NAME: Side_9
Should I, you know, stop him?

NAME: Side_6
Umm...Yeah.

NAME: Side_6
(looking down at the
guard)
He did rob us, didn't he?

NAME: Side_3
"Absolute power corrupts
absolutely." When Lord Acton stated
that, in a letter to Bishop Mandell
Creighton in 1887, no one thought
much about it, but today Metro City
is reeling from that very prophecy.
Tighten, who many thought of as our
savior, has turned his back on the
cause of justice.

NAME: Person_5
I don't understand it. He seemed to
have every characteristic we were
looking for in a superhero.

NAME: Person_1
Well, there's no use crying about
it now, we must take action. I'm
not going to play second fiddle to
that crass buffoon. We must destroy
Tighten.

NAME: Person_5
It won't be easy. Uberman had a
sense of decency and genuine love
for the people. That was his
weakness and was easily used
against him.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, but he possesses the same
flaws present in Uberman's DNA -
copper. It's like Benjamin Franklin
always said: "If something works
don't dick with it."

NAME: Person_3
I can have anything I want. I'm
like a god.

NAME: Person_3
Point to any woman in this bar. I
could have her in a second.

NAME: Person_3
Hey, you wanna get with this?

NAME: Side_16
Buddy, what do you want?

NAME: Person_3
NAME: 8Side_18
What do you want? That's the
question, isn't it. I mean, what do
you want when you can have
everything?
I suppose what I really want is to
never be forgotten again. I want to
do something that can never be cast
aside or one-upped. I want a -
what's it called? - A legacy. I
want a legacy. Yeah, that's it. I
like the sound that.

NAME: Side_16
I meant, what do you want to drink?

NAME: Person_3
Oh.

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_1
There can be only one master
criminal in this city - and it's
me.

NAME: Person_3
Really?

NAME: Person_3
I guess I should leave town then,
huh?

NAME: Person_1
I have a better idea - NOW!

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_38
That's copper my good man. Your one
weakness.
For all your amazing gifts of brawn
you are no match for my intellect.

NAME: Person_3
You know what? You're nothing but a
bug. Not even worth my effort.

NAME: Person_1
He's not as dumb as I thought.

NAME: Person_5
I guess not...Funny, though.

NAME: Person_1
What's funny?

NAME: Person_5
Funny Uberman didn't think of the
same thing.

NAME: Person_4
That's it!

NAME: Person_4
Hello, Legacy.

NAME: Side_5
Hey, that's my ball!

NAME: ELDERLY Side_21
That was a close one. Sixth floor,
please.

NAME: Person_1
Wow, I always thought Uberman was
your first superhero - but it looks
like our little Roxanne dated a
linebacker in college.

NAME: Person_2
That's my diary.

NAME: Person_1
So it is.

NAME: Person_2
It's personal.

NAME: Person_1
Well, then I wouldn't leave it in
your underwear drawer for just
anyone to find.

NAME: Person_2
What do you want?

NAME: Person_1
I need your help.

NAME: Person_2
So you knock me out and tie me to a
chair?

NAME: Person_1
You're not going to like what I'm
about to tell you.

NAME: Side_3
It's chaos here in city square as
city police -

NAME: Person_2
He's really out of control.

NAME: Person_1
Tell me about it.

NAME: Person_2
I should have known. You have
something to do with this, don't
you? - With Titan turning evil.

NAME: Person_1
Well, the evil thing he did by
himself. My goal was to give MYSELF
purpose by creating an intellectual
sparring partner.

NAME: Person_2
You're talking like you made him.

NAME: Person_1
And they call me Master Mind.

NAME: Person_2
Let me get this straight. You
missed getting your ass kicked, so
you made a new guy to kick your
ass. That's pathetic.

NAME: Person_1
In hindsight...

NAME: Person_2
And his powers, they're just like
Uberman's. Why would he have his
powers?

NAME: Person_1
I had some left over from
something. I infused him with it.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, that's why I decided to tie
you up.

NAME: Person_2
You did all this because you wanted
purpose?

NAME: Person_1
He seemed nice.

NAME: Person_3
Closer. I want to show the people
my real face.

NAME: Person_3
Recognize me?

NAME: Person_2
Hal Stewart. He's the guy we
thought saved that woman and kid.
Turned out he was just trying to
save his own ass.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, good to know - NOW!

NAME: Person_3
That's right, I'm really Hal
Stewart. Former hero and bowling
teacher at Kingpin's Bowling.

NAME: Person_2
You picked a bowler to give super
powers to?

NAME: Person_1
It's a modest profession!

NAME: Person_3
With my new found power, I've
recently started to wonder what
sort of legacy I should leave.
Should I be a hero? I tried that
once before - even saved a lady and
her baby from being squashed. I was
treated like a god until everyone
started to shit on me - Okay, so
what if I didn't "purposely" save
them!

NAME: Person_3
Well, I'm going to make something
that can't be taken away from me.
I'm going to create a permanent
monument to my greatness. One that
won't be so easily forgotten or
erased.

NAME: Person_3
I intend to create a new category
in the Guinness Book of World's
Records by rolling the biggest
strike in the history of bowling.

NAME: Person_3
My thanks to the city planning
commission. This wouldn't have been
possible without them.

NAME: Person_3
Tell your friends and family to
tune in right here to this station
at noon tomorrow.

NAME: Person_2
My god, he's nuts. That'll destroy
the whole business triangle.

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
My lair is in the direct path of
the ball.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, real nice. Wouldn't want
anything to happen to your hideout,
would we?

NAME: Person_1
You don't understand. I have
certain equipment that's - that's
highly unstable.

NAME: Person_2
What do you mean?

NAME: Person_1
I sort of have a hydrogen reactor,
okay?

NAME: Person_2
A HYDROGEN reactor?

NAME: Person_1
It's experimental - only one in the
world...Well, how do you think I
power all my inventions? Someone
like me can't pay for electricity.
The bills would be outrageous.

NAME: Person_1
It creates 100 times the output of
a nuclear one...If destroyed it
could...

NAME: Person_2
- Vaporize the entire city!

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_40
Pshaw...the whole eastern seaboard,
actually. That little baby is
amazing. I'm quite proud of it.
I mean...we'd better find a way to
stop him.

NAME: Person_1
Did Uberman have a hideout?

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
A cave, a solitary fortress of some
kind. C'mon, all heros have a place
to hang their capes up in. Roxanne,
it may be our only chance to find
something, a clue, anything that
could give us a fighting chance.

NAME: Person_2
It's under his house.

NAME: Person_1
Whose house?

NAME: Person_2
Wayne Scott's.

NAME: Person_1
Wayne Scott? Uberman was Wayne
Scott!? Wayne Scott, the wealthy
philanthropist? But he disappeared -

NAME: Person_2
He disappeared just over two months
ago when you killed him. Not only
did you rid the world of a hero,
you killed a kind, noble, generous
man.

NAME: Person_2
Looks like you got what you always
wanted. Uberman is out of the
picture and Metro City is doomed.

NAME: Person_1
"Metro City doomed." You know, I
never thought I'd say something
like this, but here it goes -

NAME: Person_1
Not if I have anything to say about
it.

NAME: Person_1
Such a dark place for one such as
you. I wonder, underneath your
noble deeds, what inner demons
drove you to your endless crusade
for justice?

NAME: Person_1
Good lord, man. You've only been
dead for two months.

NAME: Person_1
A disguise so simple, it's
ingenious. No wonder I never caught
on.

NAME: Person_1
Two lives, yet in both you were an
ideal. Perhaps it was you who was
victorious in the end, old friend.

NAME: Person_1
I'll miss how predictable you were.

NAME: Person_1
Hello? Anyone here...besides..all
the BIG MEN who are with me now?

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_41
What's the worst you're gonna find?
The man was a boy scout, not a
serial killer.

NAME: Person_1
Ahhhhhh!

NAME: Side_1
Jesus!

NAME: Side_1
What the hell are you doing here?

NAME: Person_1
I might just ask you the same
question. I had thought I
incinerated you.

NAME: Side_1
You scared the bejesus out of me.
How'd you figure out I was still
alive? Wait, how do you know my
identity!?

NAME: Person_1
Roxanne told me. As for your ruse,
I forgot to line the bottom of the
copper cage - Somebody pointed that
out to me recently. Figured if they
could do it, so could you. But one
thing I couldn't figure out -

NAME: Side_1
The skeleton? Something I
"borrowed" from a medical school a
few months before.

NAME: Person_1
A few months? How long had you been
planning this?

NAME: Side_1
I always planned to retire -
eventually. I mean, come on, you
can't do this sort of thing in your
fifties. You'd just look
ridiculous.

NAME: Person_1
I see it all so clearly now.

NAME: Person_1 (CONT'D - V.O)
Then you must have flown to a safe
distance and waited for the
explosion, then...

NAME: Side_43
Man, you ARE smart.

NAME: Person_1
But why fake your death? Why go
through all of it? You could have
just quit.

NAME: Side_1
NAME: Side_44
But the responsibility would still
be there.
A cop can retire and stop handing
out speeding tickets - but people
expect more from superheroes. I
tell you, a volcano couldn't erupt
in Zimbabwe without everyone
expecting me to do something about
it. I figured, out of sight, out of
mind.

NAME: Person_1
And Wayne Scott? Why did he have to
disappear?

NAME: Side_1
Both of my lives have so much
baggage. It's time for new baggage,
you know?

NAME: Person_1
I just can't believe it. This whole
time you've been in hiding while a
force of great evil is tearing your
city apart?

NAME: Side_1
I don't want to hear about it.
That's why I don't have a
television in here to remind me of
all the things I SHOULD be doing.
Hell, I could get a wife to do
that.

NAME: Person_1
There's a demented supervillain out
there about to destroy our - I
mean, your city.

NAME: Person_1
You're really going to do nothing?

NAME: Side_1
Good and evil have a way of
balancing themselves out. If this
guy is as bad as you say, somebody
will rise up to fight him. It's
just the order of things. You found
me, didn't you?

NAME: Side_1
I know it's hard, but you'll find
someone else someday.

NAME: Person_1
You're the only one who can stop
him.

NAME: Side_1
Couldn't if I wanted to. Gotta a
plane to catch.

NAME: Person_1
A plane?

NAME: Side_1
Going to Barbados for a little
change in climate. Now, if you'll
excuse me, I got to go pack.

NAME: Side_1
You were a good foe. I'm sorry if
I've let you down. If it makes a
difference, you were the best foe a
hero could ask for.

NAME: Person_1
Not smart enough to come up with a
full-proof trap.

NAME: Side_1
Well, you did almost have me when
you figured out my weakness was
copper. Now that made me sweat a
little. Took me way too long to
drill out from under that cage.

NAME: Person_1
I got lucky.

NAME: Side_1
Anyway, it's a good thing for my
sake that I could always count on
you for an out.

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean?

NAME: Side_1
C'mon, we always threw each other a
couple of bones. You would always
leave me an out in one of your
`full-proof' traps, and I'd never
had you incarcerated at a
penitentiary that you couldn't
eventually escape from. It kept our
little game going.

NAME: Person_1
Game? - Was that all this ever was
to you? You know, I was trying my
best every time I fought you. Those
`outs' as you call them were
unintentional.

NAME: Side_1
Oh.

NAME: Person_1
I guess I was never really a match
for you, was I?

NAME: Person_1
Then how can I expect to be one for
Titan?

NAME: Person_1
What about Roxanne?

NAME: Side_1
I think we both got what we wanted
out of our relationship. She got a
career out of me, and I got plenty
of other things out of her. But I'm
ready to move on to greener
pastures.

NAME: Person_1
I guess I wasn't the villain I
thought I was, and you...you
weren't the hero I thought you
were.

NAME: Side_1
Roxanne! How long have you been...

NAME: Person_2
Long enough.

NAME: Person_2
Don't you have something else you
can go do?

NAME: Person_3
Alright, I want this whole thing to
look ESPN professional, understand?

NAME: Person_3
You guys are about to get some good
footage. I might need a little
room, though.

NAME: Side_17
Titan, we have orders from the city
of Metro to take you into custody.
If you do not give your self up
willingly, we will be forced to
open fire.

NAME: Side_17
What is your answer?

NAME: Person_3
Miss me?

NAME: Person_3
Didn't mean to get you involved in
all of this.

NAME: Person_3
Hey, man! You killed my suds!

NAME: Person_3
That's one was for you, beer.

NAME: Person_3
Guys, please tell me you got that
last bit.

NAME: Side_3
Huh?

NAME: Person_3
You're kidding me. I give you my
sexiest moves and you mean to tell
me it was for nothing?

NAME: Side_3
We were afraid something might hit
us.

NAME: Person_3
Looks like I've given the story of
the century to the wrong man.

NAME: Person_3
Wait. What about that other
reporter. Blond. Not so lumpy on
the topper half, but killer legs.

NAME: Side_3
Roxanne. You want Roxanne. She's a
much better reporter than I am. You
want her.

NAME: Person_3
Where can I find her.

NAME: Person_9
We're actually not supposed to give
out that sort of information.

NAME: Side_3
1314 Mockingbird Lane. I believe
she lives in a penthouse.

NAME: Person_3
You've been very helpful.

NAME: Person_1
Hurry, we must be on our way as
soon as possible.

NAME: Side_2
Master, why must we flee?

NAME: Person_1
I told you, Titan is too powerful.
If he's set on destroying us,
there's precious little we could do
about it.

NAME: Side_2
Where are we going?

NAME: Person_1
To another city, someplace with a
shitload of superheroes to fight.
We'll start over, we'll go back to
doing what we do best.

NAME: Person_5
With our tails between our legs?

NAME: Person_1
Plato, do you have a better plan?!

NAME: Person_1
Hello...Roxanne?

NAME: Person_2
What are you going to do about
Tighten?

NAME: Person_1
Right now I'm packing, later I'll
have a snack on the train.

NAME: Person_2
You're running away?

NAME: Person_1
In a word - yes.

NAME: Person_2
You created this monster...

NAME: Person_1
I didn't create this - the god's of
irony did and I am eating the crow
I so richly deserve.

NAME: Person_2
There's no time for self pity.

NAME: Person_1
I'll make the time.

NAME: Person_1
You can leave with us. You'll be
safe.

NAME: Person_2
I'm not going anywhere.

NAME: Person_1
Will you listen to me, no one can
stop him.

NAME: Person_2
You have to try. The city needs
your help.

NAME: Person_1
I'm afraid you have an inflated
opinion of me.

NAME: Person_2
What the hell's happened to you?
The Master Mind I knew would never
have run from a fight even though
he knew deep in his heart that he
didn't have a chance in hell of
winning it. It was your best
quality. You need to be that man
right now...I...

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
I believe in you.

NAME: Person_1
Sweet words, but that man is dead.
Please, Roxanne, just come with me.

NAME: Person_2
No...I guess you are a coward after
all.

NAME: Person_3
Man, have I got a story for you.

NAME: Person_1
Roxanne? Roxanne?

NAME: Person_3
What pose would be best? The corny
folded arms thing?

NAME: Person_3
Or maybe on the hips, like this.

NAME: Person_3
No, makes me look like a flamer
pirate.

NAME: Person_9
Shouldn't we be making a run for it
right about now?

NAME: Person_2
The guy can outrun bullets. I don't
think either one of us is in that
kind of shape.

NAME: Person_3
She's right, Frank.

NAME: Person_3
Also got super hearing. I promise
not to keep the both of you long,
but you'll thank me when this is
all over.

NAME: Person_1
Dad, it's me...
(he looks around to make
sure no one can hear)
...Bubsy. I know we haven't talked
in a while, and I'm sorry. It's
been a little crazy trying to live
up to a legacy.

NAME: Person_1
Anyway...You raised me to be the
worst that I could possibly be. And
I've tried to live up to that as
best as I could - even dropping out
of dentistry school like you wanted
me to. But I'm about to do
something now that would really
piss you off. I'm going to go
against everything you ever taught
me. I hope...I hope that maybe
you'll look down at what I'm about
to do as not so much a good deed,
but more like the outright defiance
of a hateful and ungrateful, son.
If you could do that, then maybe -
in your own little way - you could -
for probably the first time - find
a reason to be proud of me.

NAME: Person_1
Well...either way, you're probably
going to see me real soon.
(calling over his
shoulder)
Men?

NAME: Person_5 AND Side_2
Yes Sir?

NAME: Person_1
Stop packing. Our work is not
finished here.

NAME: Side_8
We interrupt your regular afternoon
programming to show you live
footage of a potential dangerous
situation in downtown Metro. The
former hero knows as Titan is
placing what appears to be a giant
ball...

NAME: Side_8
Hold on...It appears our own
Roxanne Ritchi is somehow at the
scene. We now go to her with a live
report.

NAME: Side_2
Sir, I think you should see this!

NAME: Person_2
I'm here with the cause of the
destruction in Metro City. He has
kidnapped me and a cameraman to
chronicle what he refers to as the
creation of a monument to his
invincibility and overall
"Asskickiness." He will use this
giant concrete bowling ball to play
the largest game of bowling ever
using the buildings of downtown
Metro City as his pins.

NAME: Person_3
And I'm going for the biggest
strike ever.

NAME: Person_3
And you, Metro City, have a
ringside seat as I cement my name
in the anal of history.

NAME: Person_2
Annals.

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_2
Nevermind.

NAME: Person_3
NAME: Side_46
(in quiet professional
bowler announcer voice)
Like Tiger before him, a young
savior has come to raise a sport
from the ashes. Rookie Hal Stewart,
a young man with a dream, realizing
that dream here today, folks.
One might click there heels and say
"There's no place like home" upon
finding themselves in such a
fantasy. Well, Hal looks very much
at home right were he is - with a
ball in hand and glory in his
sights.

NAME: Person_2
Hal, I know everyone treated you
like shit, but you don't have to do
this.

NAME: Person_3
You're right. I don't HAVE to do
anything. Isn't that cool?

NAME: Person_3
Here's one for the record books!

NAME: Person_3
What the...?

NAME: Person_9
Look, what's that flying in the
air?

NAME: Person_1
C'mon, slow down

NAME: Person_1
C'mon.

NAME: Person_1
Gutterball!

NAME: Person_1
Bowling? What other trailer park
sports can you play?

NAME: Person_3
You are becoming a real pain in my
ass. I should have done this a long
time ago.

NAME: Side_47
Plato, Da Vinci.   Secure Roxanne,
he's falling for   it.

NAME: Person_3
What the hell?

NAME: Person_1
Shit! Stupid monkeys and their
fruit.

NAME: Person_3
No more games.

NAME: Person_1
Could it really be that easy--

NAME: Person_1
Didn't think so.

NAME: Person_3
If you don't mind, I'm going to
punch trough your face now.

NAME: Person_1
I'm alive.

NAME: Person_1
Uberman?

NAME: Side_48
It's Uberman!

NAME: Side_49
Uberman's alive!

NAME: Side_50
We're saved!

NAME: Person_1
I thought.

NAME: Side_4
So did I.

NAME: Side_4
Thank you, old enemy.

NAME: Person_1
For what?

NAME: Side_4
Showing me the error of my ways,
Showing me I'm meant to be this
city's savior, showing me that,
while we can try, there is no
running away from our true destiny.

NAME: Person_3
Oh...Did I interrupt something?

NAME: Person_3
Where you going, buddy?

NAME: Person_3
Welcome to Paintown. Population:
you.

NAME: Person_3
Time to finish this.

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_1
Quick joke - What's the capital of
Thailand?

NAME: Person_3
Huh - I don't know.

NAME: Person_1
It's bang cock!

NAME: Person_3
Ow.

NAME: Person_1
So, I guess pennies are good for
something.

NAME: Person_2
Pretty strange, huh?

NAME: Person_1
They're cheering for me.

NAME: Person_2
You saved them. You saved
everybody. How's it feel?

NAME: Person_1
It's a...it's nice, you know? I
usually don't get a lot of
feedback.
But I also kind of caused all this.
What happens when they find that
out I was the cause of some of
this?

NAME: Person_2
What they don't know won't hurt
them.

NAME: Person_1
I guess that is all in the past.

NAME: Person_2
You're the hero.

NAME: Person_1
I don't think I'd go that far...I
mean I just...er...

NAME: Person_2
Master Mind?

NAME: Person_1
Yes?

NAME: Person_2
Stop talking.

NAME: Side_51
Who's bad? Well, not Master Mind.
It seems the former villain has
done a career 180 after defeating
Tighten and saving Metro City from
certain enslavement. And here he is
getting a full pardon by Metro
City's Mayor, Steve Dent.

NAME: Side_52
Ahhh!

NAME: Person_1
Sorry - Metal hand. Force of habit.

NAME: Person_1
We're okay, right?

NAME: Side_3
And what about Tighten? Is there a
prison in existence that can hold
this super powered menace? Well,
the answer we found is no.

NAME: Side_53
Of course normally he could break
out of there anytime, but as you
can see we've taken some special
precautions.

NAME: Side_3
What is a Hero? It seems never has
that question needed to be asked
more than it does tonight. We go to
our very own Roxanne Ritchi, making
her triumphant return to our news
desk for the answer.

NAME: Person_2
What is a hero? Well, there are
many different kinds. There are
those who hear a call, like the
policeman or doctor, then there's
the kind the public creates in
their search for meaning and hope.
Then, there are those who have the
courage to change.

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna give you a chance to
surrender.

NAME: Person_1
Way to take out those two goons,
guys!

NAME: Side_2
What two goons?

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, we're new at this.

NAME: Person_1
...and I swear to God, she was wrecked.
It was pure insanity.

NAME: Person_1
Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...

NAME: Person_1
Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it --

NAME: Side_11
Cappuccino, please.

NAME: Person_8
On us.

NAME: Side_11
No, I insist.

NAME: Person_1
Shit.

NAME: Person_8
Where do you think you're going?

NAME: Person_1
It's -- five past...

NAME: Person_8
You'd better be here early tomorrow.

NAME: Person_1
Ok.

NAME: Person_1
And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...
Revision                      4.

NAME: Person_1
No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
waiting `til Denver to tell her...?
Oh. I see...
No, you're right. I understand.
Ok... I just... Oh...

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --

NAME: Side_8
One second.

NAME: Side_8
...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
done in here.

NAME: Side_8
You know what? I think we're good. Thanks
for coming in.

NAME: Person_5
Holy Mother of God.

NAME: Person_5
Ever heard of a vent?

NAME: Person_1
I wanted to give you an entrance.

NAME: Person_6
(appearing in the hall, 26,
eating Cheetos)
Mia! How'd it go?

NAME: Person_1
Eh...

NAME: Person_6
Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know who Jen and Rachel are.

NAME: Person_6
They're the worst.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know if they were there.

NAME: Person_6
I bet they were.
Revision                           6.

NAME: Side_18
Why is there a convention in the bathroom?

NAME: Person_5
Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming,
right?

NAME: Person_1
Can't. Working.

NAME: Person_1
Yes?

NAME: Person_5
Look, I know things didn't go well today.
There are four things in my inbox that
you're perfect for and I will submit you.
But right now -- you're coming.

NAME: Person_5
It'll be fun.

NAME: Person_1
It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed
into one of those glass houses.

NAME: Person_5
Exactly. Fun.

NAME: Person_5                         Person_1
This looks familiar.             I was going to give it
back!

NAME: Person_6
Come on, Mia. When else do you get to
see every Hollywood clich crammed
into a single home?

NAME: Person_5
Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's
nothing to make fun of. This party will
be humanity at its finest.

NAME: Person_1
No...

NAME: Person_2
You gotta stop breaking into my home.

NAME: Person_3
You think Mom or Dad would call this a
home?

NAME: Person_2
Please don't sit on that.

NAME: Person_3
Are you serious?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool.
The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away.

NAME: Person_3
I wonder why.
I brought you this. It's a throw rug.

NAME: Person_2
Don't need it.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis
pissed on it?

NAME: Person_2
That's almost insulting...
Did he?
Revision                        11.

NAME: Person_3
When are you going to unpack these boxes?

NAME: Person_2
When I unpack them in my club.

NAME: Person_3
Oh my God. It's like a girl broke up with
you and you're stalking her.
You're not still going by there, are you?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_2
They've turned it into a tapas-samba
place. You believe that?

NAME: Person_3
Seb --

NAME: Person_2
Who wants to tapas while they samba?

NAME: Person_3
I have someone I want you to meet.

NAME: Person_2
I don't want to meet anyone.

NAME: Person_3
You'll like her.

NAME: Person_2
Uh-huh. Does she like jazz?

NAME: Person_3
Probably not.

NAME: Person_2
Then what are we gonna talk about?

NAME: Person_3
You'll talk about the weather.

NAME: Person_2
Ok. Then I have someone I'd like you to
meet. He's got a face tattoo, but a heart
of gold.
Revision                      12.

NAME: Person_3
Sebastian --

NAME: Person_2
How long's it been?

NAME: Person_3
You need to get serious. You live like a
hermit. You're driving without insurance.

NAME: Person_2
I am serious. I had a very serious plan
for my future. It's not my fault I got
Shanghai'ed.

NAME: Person_3
You did not get "Shanghai'ed", you got
ripped off.

NAME: Person_2
What's the difference?

NAME: Person_3
It's not as romantic as that.
And everyone knew that guy was shady
except for you.

NAME: Person_2
Why do you say romantic like it's a dirty
word?

NAME: Person_3
Unpaid bills are not romantic. Call her.

NAME: Person_2
You're acting like life's got me on the
ropes -- what you don't understand is, I
want to be on the ropes. I'm letting life
hit me `til it gets tired. Then I'm gonna
make my move. It's a classic rope-a-dope.

NAME: Person_3
I love you. Unpack your boxes.

NAME: Person_2
I'm changing the locks.
Revision                       13.

NAME: Person_3
You can't afford it.

NAME: Person_2
I'm a phoenix rising from the ashes!

NAME: Person_9
Seb.

NAME: Person_2
Bill. Thanks for having me back.

NAME: Person_9
Your welcome. Stick to the set list.
Revision                       14.

NAME: Person_2
Of course.
(under his breath as he heads
to the piano)
Though I don't think they care what I
play.

NAME: Person_9
I do, and I don't want to hear the free
jazz.

NAME: Person_2
How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two
for you, one for me?
Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that
works. Good deal.

NAME: Side_20
Well... Welcome back.

NAME: Person_2
There's a nice way to say that.

NAME: Person_9
...every goddamned night.

NAME: Person_2
I'll stick to the set list, I promise --

NAME: Person_9
Too late. You're done.

NAME: Person_2
You're not gonna find a better player. You
know that.

NAME: Person_9
Do you think anyone here gives a shit?

NAME: Person_1
I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --

NAME: Side_21
Revision                         16.

NAME: Person_1
I don't like the fissure on the GT scan.
Did you test for achromatopsia?

NAME: Person_1
D.O.A. on 23rd, perp laughing his face off
at P.D. Damn Miranda Rights.

NAME: Person_1
This is my classroom. You don't like it,
the door's to my left.

NAME: Person_1
No, Jamal. You be trippin'.

NAME: Person_5
There you are! You need to meet someone!
Carlo, this is Mia. Mia, Carlo's a writer.

NAME: Side_9                           Person_5
Nice to meet you, Mia.          He's got projects all over
town.

NAME: Side_9
They say I have a knack for world-building.

NAME: Person_1
Congratulations. I have to grab a drink...
Revision                        17.

NAME: Side_5
Alright, one more for y'all before we
break. Do I hear any requests?

NAME: Person_1
"I Ran".

NAME: Side_5
"I Ran" it is.
Wanna start us off, piano-man?

NAME: Side_5
I walked along the avenue...

NAME: Person_2
Ok. I remember you.

NAME: Person_2
And I'm sorry if I was curt that night.

NAME: Person_1
"Curt"?

NAME: Person_2
Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that.
Revision                       18.

NAME: Person_1
Ok.

NAME: Person_2
But requesting "I Ran" from a serious
musician -- it's too far.

NAME: Person_1
My God. Did you just call yourself "a
serious musician"?

NAME: Person_2
I don't think so.

NAME: Person_1
Can I borrow what you're wearing?

NAME: Person_2
Why?

NAME: Person_1
Because I have an audition next week. I'm
playing a serious fire-fighter.

NAME: Person_2
So you're an actress. That makes sense.
Have I seen you in anything?

NAME: Person_1
Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner
Brothers lot. That's a classic.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how
you can look down on me from all the way
up there.

NAME: Side_5
Sebastian. Second set.

NAME: Person_2
He doesn't tell me what to do.

NAME: Person_1
He just told you what to do.

NAME: Person_2
I let him.
Revision                          19.

NAME: Person_2
What's your name?

NAME: Person_1
Mia.

NAME: Person_2
Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies.

NAME: Side_5
Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you
did tonight...

NAME: Side_9
...Goldilocks from the point of view of
the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox
and Warners are going crazy for it.

NAME: Side_9
...We're going after Charlize. For the
bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a
franchise. But the thing is it's grounded.

NAME: Person_1
George Michael!

NAME: Person_2
You again.

NAME: Person_1
Did you just get your keys?

NAME: Person_2
...Yeah.
Revision                       20.

NAME: Person_1
Can you grab mine?

NAME: Person_2
...Which one is it?

NAME: Person_1
The Prius.

NAME: Person_1
The one with the green ribbon.

NAME: Person_1
Shit...

NAME: Person_2
Those look comfortable.

NAME: Person_1
They are...n't.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you for saving the day back there.

NAME: Person_2
You didn't give me much of a choice.

NAME: Person_1
Strange that we keep running into each
other.

NAME: Person_2
It is strange. Maybe it means something.

NAME: Person_1
I doubt it.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah I don't think so either.
Revision                        21.

NAME: Person_2
Put the clicker under your chin.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_2
It turns your head into an antenna.
Probably gives you cancer, but you find
your car more quickly.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh.

NAME: Person_2
You don't live as long, but you get
things done faster, so it all evens out.

NAME: Person_1
Oh my God.

NAME: Person_1
Eh.

NAME: Person_2
Not much to look at.

NAME: Person_1
Agreed. I've seen better.

NAME: Person_1
Hey... Greg...? Can you hear me...? Yeah,
I'm just leaving now... K, see you soon...

NAME: Person_1
Ah. Great... Well... Do you want a ride
to your car?

NAME: Person_2
No, that's fine... Thanks...

NAME: Person_1
...Ok...

NAME: Person_1
Night.

NAME: Side_12
Are these pastries gluten-free?

NAME: Person_1
No...

NAME: Side_12
What?? I want a refund.

NAME: Person_8
You're closing up Friday.

NAME: Person_1
I have an audition. Remember?

NAME: Person_8
Do I look like I care? Reschedule it.

NAME: Person_1
But you said --

NAME: Person_8
And fix your apron.

NAME: Person_1
...Hi.
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_2
Meetings. Studio heads.
Revision                       24.

NAME: Person_1
Uh-huh. How'd you get on the lot?

NAME: Person_2
Piece of cake.

NAME: Person_2
Actually it took me four hours and I
ended up running. We probably have twenty
minutes before the guy finds me. You got
a break coming up?

NAME: Person_1
I'm off in ten.

NAME: Person_2
Great. I'll hide in the bathroom.

NAME: Person_1
That's the window Ingrid Bergman and
Humphrey Bogart looked out of in
Casablanca.

NAME: Person_2
What's your Bogart's name...?
Is it Greg?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Greg.

NAME: Person_2
How long have...?

NAME: Person_1
We've been seeing each other for a few
months.

NAME: Person_1
I love this stuff. Makes coming to work
easier.

NAME: Person_2
I know what you mean. I get breakfast
five miles out of the way just to sit
outside a jazz club.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah?

NAME: Person_2
It was called Van Beek. The swing bands
played there. Count Basie. Chick Webb.
It's a samba-tapas place now.

NAME: Person_1
A what?

NAME: Person_2
Samba-tapas. It's... Exactly. The joke's on
history.

NAME: Person_2
Anyway, that's L.A. They worship everything
and they value nothing.

NAME: Side_23
Clear the frame!

NAME: Person_1
We need to wait here.

NAME: Person_2
I know. They shoot movies on my street.
"C-stands." "Apple box." "Don't forget to
sign out."

NAME: Person_2
How'd you get into all this?
Revision                          26.

NAME: Person_1
Into...? Oh -- I -- my aunt was an
actress. She was in this traveling
theater company... And there was this
little library across the street from my
house when I was growing up. This was
Boulder City, Nevada -- every house
looked exactly the same. I was ten and
already I needed to get out. And one day,
my aunt flew into town, and she showed me
the library's old-movie section. We spent
a whole day watching one after the other.
Bringing Up Baby. Notorious. Casablanca.
I never knew the world was so big.

NAME: Person_1
I started putting on plays in my garage.
I'd write the scripts and print up
programs, and she'd give me props to use
from wherever she'd just been -- New
York, London, Paris. And then she'd jet
off again and I wouldn't hear from her
for another year.

NAME: Person_2
Who would you invite to watch? Your
parents?

NAME: Person_1
God no -- I didn't invite anyone. That
would have been terrifying.

NAME: Person_1
Honestly, I wish I loved something else.
I've tried so hard to want other things.

NAME: Person_1
I left school after two years to come here,
my fourth manager just dropped me, and my
last audition was for a teen soap pitched
as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.
Should've been a lawyer.
Revision                        27.

NAME: Person_2
...`Cause the world needs more lawyers.

NAME: Person_1
Well it doesn't need more actresses.

NAME: Person_2
You're not just an actress.

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean, "just an actress"?

NAME: Person_2
You said it yourself, you're a child-
prodigy playwright.

NAME: Person_1
That is not what I said.

NAME: Person_2
You're too modest to say it but it's
true. So you could write your own roles.
Write something that's as interesting as
you are.

NAME: Person_1
Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine
for an open-mic night. It was horrible.

NAME: Person_2
All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong
could have played the marching-band
charts he was given. What did he do
instead? He made history.

NAME: Person_1
Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make
history instead.

NAME: Person_1
Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's
something I should tell you...

NAME: Person_2
Yeah?
Revision                       28.

NAME: Person_1
I hate jazz.

NAME: Person_2
What does that mean? "I hate jazz"?

NAME: Person_1
It means when I listen to it I don't like
it.

NAME: Person_2
But it's such a blanket statement. It's
like saying "I hate animals".

NAME: Person_1
I do hate some animals.

NAME: Person_2
Do you need to be anywhere right now?

NAME: Person_2
Most people say they hate jazz because
they don't have context. They don't get
where it came from. All these people
packed into flophouses in New Orleans,
speaking five different languages, and
jazz was how they talked to each other.

NAME: Person_1
I thought it was just Kenny G.

NAME: Person_2
...What?

NAME: Person_1
I associate it with facials. It's
relaxing.

NAME: Person_2
It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a
gunfight `cause somebody told him he
played a wrong note!
Revision                           29.

NAME: Person_1
Right, but it's good to talk over. Where
I grew up there's this jazz station
they'd play at cocktail parties whenever
they served the salami and cheese.

NAME: Person_2
Mia. These are things you can't unsay.

NAME: Person_2
It's not cocktail music -- it's a high-
wire act. These guys are performing and
composing and rearranging all at once.

NAME: Person_2
That's why you need to be in the space
and see what's at stake. This whole thing
-- it's dying. In twenty minutes they'll
head off to cut commercial sessions or do
pit at the Pantages `cause they have to --
but when I have my own place -- my club --
they'll play whatever they want.

NAME: Person_1
Your club?

NAME: Person_2
...It's gonna be the old Van Beek. I'm
getting the lease back. It'll be perfect.

NAME: Person_2
The world tells everyone to move on. Says
the music's had its moment. But I love it
too much. I'm not moving on.

NAME: Person_2
So?

NAME: Person_1
Hi, I just missed a call...

NAME: Person_1
I got a call-back!

NAME: Person_2
Really? For what?

NAME: Person_1
That show I told you about.

NAME: Person_2
Dangerous Minds meets The O.C.?

NAME: Person_1
Right. It's -- actually more like Rebel
Without a Cause.

NAME: Person_2
That's amazing! "I got the bulletsssss!"

NAME: Person_2
You've seen it, right?

NAME: Person_1
Obviously.
No.

NAME: Person_2
What? You're the movie person.

NAME: Person_1
It's the one I lie about.

NAME: Person_2
Come on. You can't do this audition and
never see Rebel. The theater near me's
playing it. If you want -- I can take
you. For research.

NAME: Person_1
...Ok.
Revision                          31.

NAME: Person_2
10pm Monday at the Rialto. Cool?

NAME: Person_1
Ok.
For research.

NAME: Person_1
Hi, Mom!

NAME: Person_1
Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot.

NAME: Person_1
Well -- it's not picked up yet.

NAME: Person_1
First they make the pilot, then if they
like the pilot it goes on TV.
Revision                           32.

NAME: Person_1
Well, no, I have a call-back.

NAME: Person_1
It's another audition.

NAME: Person_1
...Well when you put it like that it
sounds like a huge accomplishment.

NAME: Person_1
Oxygen.

NAME: Person_1
You know what, I have to go. I love you.

NAME: Side_24
Mia Dolan?

NAME: Side_10
Whenever you're ready.

NAME: Person_1
Two options. Follow my rules, or follow
my rules. Kapish? You want to bully,
you'd best be ready to get bullied --

NAME: Side_10
Thanks.

NAME: Person_1
I can do it another way --

NAME: Side_10
No, thanks, that was great.

NAME: Person_6
Mia?

NAME: Person_6
Greg's here...

NAME: Side_1
Hey... I'm parked out front. But we
should hurry, my brother just landed.

NAME: Side_1
Did you forget?

NAME: Person_1
Shit. No. Yes. I'll change...

NAME: Side_1
It's ok.

NAME: Side_1 (O.S.)
Josh! Yep, just picking Mia up now. Will
be there in twenty.

NAME: Side_2
That's right -- but now we've got a
surround-sound set-up, so it's like --

NAME: Side_13
It's like being in a movie theater.

NAME: Side_2
It's better than going to a theater,
really. You know theaters these days --

NAME: Side_1
Oh, sure --

NAME: Side_2
-- they're so dirty, and they're either
too hot or too cold, and there's always
people talking, which is just --
-- just so annoying, I mean you're trying
to watch a movie -- one second --
Hello?...

NAME: Side_13
Probably work.

NAME: Side_2
Yeah, I'll have to call you back.
So, yeah, we love it.

NAME: Side_2
One word for you. Nicaragua.

NAME: Side_1
I've never heard anyone say that. Was it
amazing?
Revision                          36.

NAME: Side_2
Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort.
It was unbelievable.

NAME: Side_1
Mia?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_1
I have an idea.

NAME: Person_5
Is that a script?

NAME: Person_1
It's a play. I'm going to put it on myself.

NAME: Person_1
Actually -- it's a -- it's a one-woman
show...

NAME: Person_5
...Is that gonna happen every time?

NAME: Person_1
I think so.

NAME: Person_1 (O.S.)
It's one-way!!

NAME: Person_2
Keith?
Revision                       41.

NAME: Person_4
Holy shit. Come here, man.

NAME: Person_2
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.
We used to play together.

NAME: Person_4                           Person_1
Hey, Mia.                         Hey...

NAME: Person_4
So how've you been?

NAME: Person_2
Great. You?

NAME: Person_4
Keeping busy. Got a new combo.

NAME: Person_2
Good for you.

NAME: Person_4
...Looking for keys.

NAME: Person_2
I'm good.

NAME: Person_4
You sure? It pays.

NAME: Person_2
I'm good.

NAME: Person_4
Let's just grab a drink then. Call me.
It's been too long.

NAME: Person_2
You bet.

NAME: Person_4
Nice meeting you, Mia.
Revision                           42.

NAME: Person_1
Nice meeting you.

NAME: Person_2
It's beautiful.

NAME: Person_1
...You're just saying that.

NAME: Person_2
No... I'm not.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know... Is the whole thing too
nostalgic?

NAME: Person_2
That's the point.

NAME: Person_1
But do you think people will like it?

NAME: Person_2
Fuck `em.

NAME: Person_1
You always say that.

NAME: Person_2
I truly believe it.

NAME: Person_1
Fine -- as long as you sit front-row
`cause I'll probably throw up on the
middle of the stage otherwise.

NAME: Person_2
I'll be front-row.

NAME: Person_1
I made something for you.

NAME: Person_2
What's that?

NAME: Person_1
It could be the name design. On the door.

NAME: Person_2
Why does it say "Seb's"?

NAME: Person_1
That's what you should name it.

NAME: Person_2
Never.

NAME: Person_1
Sebastian, no one's going to a club called
"Chicken on a Stick".

NAME: Person_2
You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name
"Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's
gonna be old-school jazz and beer and
chicken. "Chicken on a Stick".

NAME: Person_1
No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz.
And it's time to start looking for other
places.

NAME: Person_2
It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them
samba all over its history.

NAME: Person_1
Make your own history.

NAME: Person_2
Your play's incredible.

NAME: Person_2
The whole world from your bedroom? Who's
doing that?
Revision                    44.

NAME: Person_1
I'm doing that.

NAME: Person_1
So who was that guy at the Lighthouse?

NAME: Person_2
...Which guy?

NAME: Person_1
The one who offered you a gig.

NAME: Person_2
You mean Keith? He's the worst.

NAME: Person_1
Why was it weird between you two?

NAME: Person_2
It's always weird with him.

NAME: Person_1
He did offer you a job.

NAME: Person_2
Right...

NAME: Person_1
Are you going to call him?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_1
Ok...

NAME: Person_2
Here's what we know. It's definitely
Chicken on a Stick --
-- and your play is going to be a
triumph.

NAME: Person_1 (O.S.)
Look -- he's going to find a way to open
it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's
Dad?

NAME: Person_4
Sebastian.

NAME: Person_4
Didn't know if I'd see you today.

NAME: Person_2
Well... Here I am.

NAME: Person_2
Where's the piano?

NAME: Person_4
Here's the deal. We've got distribution
with Universal, got our own imprint.
We're about to go on the road. We can cut
you in for 1K a week while we tour, plus
an equal share of any merchandise or
ticket revenue that comes in. Sound good?

NAME: Person_4
Sebastian?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, that...that...
...sounds good.

NAME: Person_4
Let's play, see how it feels.

NAME: Person_4
I know. It's different.

NAME: Person_4
But you say you want to save jazz. How
are you going to save jazz if no one's
listening? Jazz wouldn't exist if people
hadn't gotten tired of what they were
listening to before.
I mean, do you really think a bunch of
ninety-year-olds in a basement is the
future of the form? Traditionalists whined
when Kenny Clarke started dropping bombs.
If traditionalists had their way, we'd
still be playing Dixieland.

NAME: Person_2
You're holding onto the past. But jazz is
about the future.

NAME: Person_4
I get it. I got it wrong. Last guy wasn't
as good as you. But you're a pain in the
ass, man.

NAME: Person_4
If it's not your thing, just let me know.
I don't want you uncomfortable and trying
to change this into something it's not.
But if you want it -- the job's yours.

NAME: Side_27
Revision                      48.

NAME: Person_2                        Person_1
City of stars...              You've never shined so
brightly.
Revision                           50.

NAME: Side_29
Revision                          51.

NAME: Person_3
Look at him -- watch --

NAME: Person_3
Now he's going to check the other window.
Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check
again. Yep, still closed.

NAME: Side_15
Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two
want anything?

NAME: Person_1
Thanks Harry, I'm good.
Revision                       52.

NAME: Person_3
Same here but I think someone's trying to
break into your car.

NAME: Person_3
Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now?

NAME: Person_1
I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure...

NAME: Person_3
You should come over tonight. Harry's
cooking, but don't let that stop you.
What's the matter?

NAME: Person_1
Nothing...

NAME: Person_3
You miss him.

NAME: Person_1
I guess. I'm adapting.

NAME: Person_3
I got used to being alone. Growing up it
was just me and Seb. We only had each other.

NAME: Person_1
He told me.

NAME: Person_3
I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met
Harry and -- we just fit...
You've changed Seb. You know that?

NAME: Person_1
Do you think he's happy?

NAME: Person_3
Is he happy?

NAME: Person_1
I mean with the band, the travel, all of it.
Revision                        53.

NAME: Person_3
Our dad never got to do what he wanted.
We were always treading water, he took a
job running a washer-dryer store. But
every night at home he'd play his
clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record.
So I look at Sebastian... Playing music,
getting paid for it. I'm happy for him.

NAME: Person_3
Dreams change.

NAME: Person_3
Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon.

NAME: Person_3
I told you not to get me anything!

NAME: Side_15
Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess.

NAME: Person_3
No -- I changed my mind.

NAME: Person_1
Hey it's me... Not sure where you are --
maybe Boston? Or Dallas? Anyway... I
haven't heard from you in a while... I
miss you...
Ok... Bye...

NAME: Person_2
Surprise.

NAME: Person_2
And...
(he hurries to the kitchen --
and holds up a big apple pie)
There's twenty-five pounds of apples in
it. It probably destroyed an ecosystem
but it tastes good.

NAME: Person_2
I have to head back in the morning but I
needed to see you.

NAME: Person_2
Feels so good to be home.

NAME: Person_1
Stay.

NAME: Person_2
How's the play going?

NAME: Person_1
I'm nervous.
Revision                 55.

NAME: Person_2
Why?

NAME: Person_1
Because...
What if people show up?

NAME: Person_2
Fuck `em!

NAME: Person_2
You're nervous about what they think?

NAME: Person_1
I'm nervous to be up on a stage and
perform in front of people. I'm
terrified.

NAME: Person_2
They should be so lucky to see it.
It's going to be incredible. I can't
wait.

NAME: Person_1
I can.

NAME: Person_1
What time do you leave in the morning?

NAME: Person_1
Ugh.

NAME: Person_2
Yep. Boise.

NAME: Person_1
Boise?

NAME: Person_2
You should come.

NAME: Person_1
To Boise?
Revision                     56.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, you could knock that off your
bucket list.

NAME: Person_1
Wish I could.

NAME: Person_2
Why can't you?

NAME: Person_1
Come to Boise?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Because I have to rehearse.

NAME: Person_2
Can't you rehearse anywhere?

NAME: Person_1
You mean anywhere you are?

NAME: Person_2
...I -- I guess...

NAME: Person_1
Well, all my stuff is here and my show's
in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it
doesn't seem practical...

NAME: Person_2
Right... I just -- we're going to have to
do things so we can see each other. We
never see each other.

NAME: Person_1
I know, but when are you done?

NAME: Person_2
...What do you mean?

NAME: Person_1
When are you done with the tour?
Revision                   57.

NAME: Person_2
But -- as soon as we're done with the
tour we go back and record, and then we
go back on tour.

NAME: Person_2
We tour so we can make the record, and
then we go back on tour to sell the
record.

NAME: Person_1
So it's...the long haul?

NAME: Person_2
...What does that mean?

NAME: Person_1
I mean the long haul -- like, you're
going to be in this band for a long time.

NAME: Person_2
What did you think I was going to do?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know, I didn't think the band
would --

NAME: Person_2
You didn't think we'd be successful.

NAME: Person_1
No, that's not what I meant. What I meant
was -- this band -- you're going to be on
the road for -- what, years now?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road
for years with just this record.

NAME: Person_1
Do you like the music you're playing?

NAME: Person_2
I don't know how that matters.

NAME: Person_1
It matters if you're going to give up
your dream to be on the road for years.
Revision                    58.

NAME: Person_2
Do you like the music I'm playing?

NAME: Person_1
Yes. I do.
I just didn't think you did.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, well, I --

NAME: Person_1
And now I hear you're going to be on the
road for years, and I'm --

NAME: Person_2
What are you doing? Why are you doing
this?

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean why am I doing this?

NAME: Person_2
This is what you wanted from me.

NAME: Person_1
To be in this band?

NAME: Person_2
To have a steady job.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, I wanted you to have a job so you
could take care of yourself and start
your club.

NAME: Person_2
So I'm doing that. So why aren't we
celebrating?

NAME: Person_1
Why aren't you starting your club?

NAME: Person_2
You said yourself no one wants to go to
that club! No one wants to go to a club
called Chicken on a Stick --

NAME: Person_1
Change the name!

NAME: Person_2
-- and no one likes jazz. Not even you.
Revision                         59.

NAME: Person_1
I do like jazz now, because of you.

NAME: Person_2
What am I supposed to do? Go back to
playing "Jingle Bells" so I can save
money for some Shangri-La club no one
wants to go to?

NAME: Person_1
People will want to go to it! People love
what other people are passionate about.

NAME: Person_2
Not in my experience.

NAME: Person_2
Anyway -- it's time to grow up. You know?
This is what I'm doing. If you had a
problem, I wish you would've said
something earlier, before I signed on the
dotted line.

NAME: Person_1
You had a dream that you were sticking
to, that --

NAME: Person_2
This is the dream!

NAME: Person_1
This is not your dream.

NAME: Person_2
Guys like me go their whole lives and
never do anything that's liked. I'm
finally doing something that people
enjoy. What is wrong with that?

NAME: Person_1
Why do you care so much about being liked

NAME: Person_2
You're an actress, who are you to talk??

NAME: Person_2
Maybe you liked me more when I was a
failure because it made you feel better
about yourself.

NAME: Person_1
Are you kidding?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_2
Wait --

NAME: Person_2                          COLE
See you tomorrow.                 See ya.

NAME: Person_4
You good for tonight, right?

NAME: Person_2
...Tonight?

NAME: Person_4
Seven. The photo shoot.
Mojo.

NAME: Person_2
I thought that was next Thursday.

NAME: Person_4
No. It's tonight.

NAME: Person_4
Is that ok?

NAME: Side_3
Put a light on the drums... I need more
fill in this corner...

NAME: Side_3
Bass, head up. Piano, look down at the
keys.

NAME: Side_3
Cut the music. Turn the keyboard live.
Piano look up, play.

NAME: Side_3
No -- piano -- actually play something.

NAME: Side_3
Good, now bite your lip like you're
concentrating on a solo.

NAME: Side_3
That was good. Don't stop.

NAME: Person_2
Mia!

NAME: Person_2
I'm sorry --

NAME: Person_1
Stop --

NAME: Person_2
I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm
sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise
I'll make it up to you --

NAME: Person_1
It's over.

NAME: Person_2
...What do you mean?

NAME: Person_1
I'm done embarrassing myself.

NAME: Person_2
You didn't embarrass yourself...
Revision                     65.

NAME: Person_1
No one showed up. I can't even pay back
the theater.

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna go home for a while.

NAME: Person_2
...This is home.

NAME: Person_1
Not anymore.

NAME: Person_3
You remember the McKenzies?

NAME: Person_2
Oh God, I didn't see them.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah. They kept going, "oh Sebastian's so
handsome".

NAME: Person_2
You look beautiful.
I hope it was ok. I haven't played in a while.

NAME: Person_3
You were great
You're always great when you play.

NAME: Person_3
Now -- listen to me. I want you to save
for a down payment. You understand? You
need a home.

NAME: Person_2
Yes ma'am.

NAME: Person_3
I'm not gonna be hovering anymore.

NAME: Person_2
...You still think New York?

NAME: Person_3
I think so. Maybe Boston. I don't know,
it's exciting...

NAME: Person_3
Ah I gotta -- the future in-laws...

NAME: Person_3
Is my...my hair...?

NAME: Person_2
What...?

NAME: Person_2
Wrong number.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, well...not anymore.

NAME: Person_2
I won't.

NAME: Person_2
"Casting"...?
Revision                      68.

NAME: Person_1'S MOM                            Person_1
Night, sweetie.                 Night, Mom.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
You want some more rice?

NAME: Person_1
I'm ok.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
You look hungry.

NAME: Person_1
I'm good...

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
It's fun having you back. Your mom
ditches me at ten.

NAME: Person_1
You took down the swing.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
She made me.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
I've still got all your old tapes.

NAME: Person_1
Oh God. Throw those away.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
Never.

NAME: Person_1'S DAD
What the hell...?

NAME: Person_1
Why did you come here?

NAME: Person_2
Because I have good news.

NAME: Person_1
Ok...

NAME: Person_2
Amy Brandt. The casting director.

NAME: Person_1
I know who she is.

NAME: Person_2
She was at your play. And she loved it.
And she loved it so much that she wants
you to come audition for a huge movie
she's got.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not going.

NAME: Person_2
...Excuse me?

NAME: Person_1
I'm -- no... That will kill me.

NAME: Person_2
That's it?

NAME: Person_1
Yes.
Revision                    70.

NAME: Person_2
So you're happy here?

NAME: Person_1
I'm happier.

NAME: Person_2
Why won't you come?

NAME: Person_1
I told you.

NAME: Person_2
I don't buy it.

NAME: Person_1
Because it's another audition!
I've been to hundreds of auditions. Do
you want to know what happens? Either
they interrupt me because someone ordered
a sandwich, or they cut me off after two
seconds, or I'm crying and they start
laughing, or I'm one of a hundred
lookalikes in the waiting room who never
has a chance, because --
-- because --

NAME: Person_2
Because what?

NAME: Person_1
Because I'm probably not good enough.

NAME: Person_2
Yes you are.

NAME: Person_1
No. Maybe I'm not.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe I'm one of those people who's
always wanted to do it but never had a
chance. It's a pipe dream. Maybe it's
like you said. Maybe I need to grow up.

NAME: Person_1
I can go back to school. I can find
something else that I'm supposed to do. I
left school to give it a shot, and it
didn't work out, and it took six years,
and I don't want to do it anymore.

NAME: Person_2
Why?

NAME: Person_1
Why what?

NAME: Person_2
Why don't you want to do it anymore?

NAME: Person_1
...Because it hurts a little bit too
much.

NAME: Person_2
I told them you'd be there at five-thirty
tomorrow. I'll swing by here before I
drive back at eight. Either you'll be
outside or you won't.

NAME: Person_1
How did you find me?

NAME: Person_2
The house across from the library.

NAME: Side_6                       Person_1
Hi, Mia.                        Hi.

NAME: Side_6
I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you.

NAME: Side_6
The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script.
Revision                        73.

NAME: Side_33
We want to build the character with you.
It's a process. Three-month rehearsal,
four-month shoot.

NAME: Person_1
...Ok.

NAME: Side_6
So why don't you just tell us a story?

NAME: Person_1
...About...?

NAME: Side_6
About anything.

NAME: Side_6
Whenever you're ready.

NAME: Person_1
My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She
used to tell me these stories, when I was
growing up, about living abroad...
I remember -- she told me she jumped into
the Seine once...

NAME: Person_2
When do you find out?

NAME: Person_1
They said the next couple of days... But
I'm not expecting to find anything out.

NAME: Person_2
You're going to get it.

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm not.

NAME: Person_2
You are. I know these things.

NAME: Person_1
Where are we?

NAME: Person_2
Griffith Park.

NAME: Person_1
I mean -- where are we?

NAME: Person_2
I know...
I don't know.

NAME: Person_1
What do we do?

NAME: Person_2
I don't think we can do anything. Because
when you get this --

NAME: Person_1
If I get this --
Revision                           75.

NAME: Person_2
When you get this -- you've got to give
it everything you've got.

NAME: Person_2
It's your dream.

NAME: Person_1
What are you going to do?

NAME: Person_2
I've got to follow my own plan. Stay
here. Get my own thing going. You know...

NAME: Person_2
You're going to be in Paris. Good jazz
there. And you love jazz now.

NAME: Person_2
Right?

NAME: Person_1
Right.

NAME: Person_2
I guess we're just going to have to wait
and see.

NAME: Person_1
You know I'm always going to love you.

NAME: Person_2
I'm always going to love you too.

NAME: Person_2
Look at this view.

NAME: Person_1
I've seen better.
Revision                         76.

NAME: Person_2
Agreed.

NAME: Person_1
I've never been here during the day.

NAME: Person_1
Hi... Iced coffee, please.

NAME: NEW Person_8
On us.

NAME: Person_1
No, no, that's fine.

NAME: Person_2
Alright, I'm done.
Harris did a nice job with it.

NAME: Side_7
Took him long enough.

NAME: Person_2
No one touches the instruments. Carson's
coming an hour early to test levels.

NAME: Side_7
I got a check for you to sign.

NAME: Person_2
How'd we do last month?

NAME: Side_7
Not too bad.
Revision                          78.

NAME: Person_2
Not too bad is great.
(taps the Employee on the
shoulder)
See you tonight.

NAME: Side_7
See you tonight.

NAME: Side_16
King Seb!

NAME: Person_2
Hothouse Eddie -- miss me?

NAME: Side_16
Like the desert misses the rain.

NAME: Side_17
Seb -- Edgar's bringing his horn tonight.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah? Tell him to tune it, huh?

NAME: Side_17
That's not Edgar.

NAME: Person_1
Bye, sweetie. You be nice to Chelsea.

NAME: Side_35
Bye, Mrs. Dolan.

NAME: Side_4
What if we miss this? What do we tell
Natalie?
Revision                      80.

NAME: Person_1
We can just see it back in New York...

NAME: Person_1
Do you want to just skip it...? Turn off
here and get dinner?

NAME: Side_4
Alright...

NAME: Side_4
This looks fun.

NAME: Side_4
Come on...

NAME: Side_4
Mia?

NAME: Person_2
Manny Halloran, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't know, I told him to play "Jingle
Bells".

NAME: Person_2
Welcome to Seb's.

NAME: Person_1
I just wanted to say -- I saw your
playing, and I --

NAME: Side_36
Revision                           85.

NAME: Side_4
Do you want to stay for another?

NAME: Person_1
No... We should go.

NAME: Side_5
Goddamn bugs.

NAME: Side_5
Deja me hablar.

NAME: Person_7
Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
you comin' from?

NAME: Side_5
I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

NAME: Person_7
Sure you were. What do you say we have a
look at your catch?

NAME: Person_7
Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.
Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!

NAME: Person_7
What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
need --

NAME: Person_1
We'll take it from here.

NAME: Person_7
Who the hell are you?

NAME: Person_1
INS Division 6.

NAME: Person_7
Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

NAME: Person_1
Really?

NAME: Person_1
What're we thinking, Dee?

NAME: Side_2
Tough call, Kay.

NAME: Person_1
!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
Estados Unidos.
(Don't worry grandma.
Welcome to the United
States.)
A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
no? Buena suerta.
(Where are you going? San
Antonio?  Looking for
work, aren't you?  Good
luck.)
Es un placer verle aqui.
(It's a pleasure seeing
you here.)

NAME: Person_1
Que dices si te rompo la cara?
(What do you say if I
break your face?)

NAME: Person_1
No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
verdad, amigo?
(You don't speak a word
of Spanish, right, friend?)

NAME: Person_1
We got a winner.
Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
(The rest of you are free
to go. Scram!)

NAME: Person_7
Sir!

NAME: Person_1
Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.

NAME: Person_7
Sir, you can't just --

NAME: Person_1
Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
dealing with!

NAME: Person_1
We're gonna have a little chat with our
friend here. You boys can hit the road ...
and keep on protecting us from dangerous
aliens.

NAME: Person_7
You ever heard of Division 6?

NAME: Side_14
There is no Division 6.

NAME: Side_20
Who are those guys?

NAME: Person_1
I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
dollars to pesos that you're not --

NAME: Person_1
-- from anywhere near here.

NAME: Person_1
Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

NAME: Person_1
Political refugee. Right.

NAME: Side_2
You know how many treaty articles you've
just violated?

NAME: Person_1
One, my ass. Try seven.

NAME: Side_2
From unauthorized immigration to failure to
properly inoculate prior to landing.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
put up your arms.

NAME: Person_1
Ah, shit.

NAME: Person_1
Dee! Shoot him!

NAME: Person_1
Dee, for Christ's --

NAME: Person_7
Th -- th -- th --

NAME: Person_1
"That."

NAME: Person_7
That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

NAME: Person_1
Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
you.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
calm down. If you'll just give me your
attention for a moment I'll tell you what
happened.

NAME: Person_1
This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
some friends from out of town. The red eye
here isolates and measures the electronic
impulses in your brain. More specifically,
the ones for memory.

NAME: Person_1
Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
holes at 40, 60, and 80.

NAME: Side_14
What in the hell is going on?!

NAME: Person_1
Exactly the right question. And the answer
lies right -- here. Pay attention.

NAME: Side_21
Who are you, really?

NAME: Person_1
Really? I'm just a figment of your
imagination.

NAME: Person_1
God, we're a gullible breed.

NAME: Person_1
I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
alive after a blast like that.

NAME: Person_7
What -- blast?

NAME: Person_1
Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
to exercise more caution before discharging
your firearms.

NAME: Person_1
Especially you.

NAME: Side_2
I'm sorry. About...back there.

NAME: Person_1
Happens.

NAME: Side_2
Didn't used to.

NAME: Side_2
The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
me...

NAME: Side_2
They're beautiful, aren't they?

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Side_2
The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

NAME: Person_1
No. You won't.

NAME: Person_3
Stop! NYPD!

NAME: Side_9
All yours, Edwards!

NAME: Person_3
Grand Central Station off to your left,
folks...

NAME: Person_3
Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
gear!

NAME: Person_3
Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

NAME: Side_12
He's coming! He's coming!

NAME: Person_3
And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
too.

NAME: Person_3
What the...

NAME: Person_3
Wassup?

NAME: Side_12
He's coming! He's coming because I failed,
and now he'll kill me too!

NAME: Person_3
Stop!

NAME: Side_12
You don't understand. Your world is gonna
end.

NAME: Person_3
What are you?!

NAME: Side_6
Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

NAME: Person_3
No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
again with another completely different set.

NAME: Side_11
Sort of a low beam, high beam.

NAME: Side_6
Was that before or after he drew the weapon
which you claim evaporated into a million
pieces?

NAME: Person_3
After, sir.

NAME: Side_6
And why do you suppose none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?

NAME: Person_3
'Cause some of the other officers are a
little soggy in the midsection. And they
couldn't keep up, sir.

NAME: Side_11
Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
am --

NAME: Person_3
What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

NAME: Side_11
What the hell is your problem?

NAME: Person_3
My problem is you being all up in my damn
face all the time.

NAME: Side_11
I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
minutes -- your best shot.

NAME: Side_6
Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
Now.

NAME: Person_3
You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
pudgy bastard.

NAME: Person_4
Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
believe you. I opened him up. Find me at
the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
found.

NAME: Person_3
Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

NAME: Person_4
You have really pretty eyes.

NAME: Person_4
Yes. That's right.

NAME: Person_1
Some night, huh?

NAME: Person_3
Oh, yeah, some night.

NAME: Person_1
They were gills.

NAME: Person_1
Not eyelids.

NAME: Person_3
Who are you?

NAME: Person_1
Did he say anything to you?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
an end.

NAME: Person_1
Did he say when?

NAME: Person_3
You're kidding, right?

NAME: Person_1
Would you recognize his weapon if you saw
it again?

NAME: Person_3
Absolutely.

NAME: Person_1
Let's take a ride.

NAME: Person_3
Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

NAME: Person_1
It's all done.

NAME: Side_6
Good work, Edwards.

NAME: Person_1
You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
That's double tough.

NAME: Person_3
So who you with?

NAME: Person_3
You got the plain clothes, the
government-issued wheels. Secret Service?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
funding.

NAME: Person_1
Nothing is what it seems, kid.

NAME: Person_3
Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

NAME: Person_1
I'm part of a secret organization that
monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

NAME: Person_3
This is where we're going?

NAME: Person_3
Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
Doesn't even sell guns.

NAME: Person_1
Really?

NAME: Person_3
All right, you think it's worth shaking him
up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
answers.

NAME: Person_1
Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

NAME: Person_8
Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
proper authorities.

NAME: Person_3
Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

NAME: Person_8
Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
work here because I love the hours.

NAME: Person_3
I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
stuff.

NAME: Person_8
C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

NAME: Person_8
H-hiya Kay, how are you?

NAME: Person_1
The imports, Jeebs. Now.

NAME: Person_8
You know I got outta that business a long
time ago, Kay.

NAME: Person_1
Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
lie.

NAME: Person_8
Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

NAME: Person_1
I'm going to count to three.

NAME: Person_3
He'll do it, Jeebs.

NAME: Person_1
One.

NAME: Person_3
I've seen him do it.

NAME: Person_1
Two.

NAME: Person_3
Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
like this.

NAME: Person_8
He's always crazy.
Take a cruise. Get a massage --

NAME: Person_1
Three.

NAME: Person_3
Put down the gun and put your hands on the
counter!

NAME: Person_1
I warned him.

NAME: Person_3
Drop the weapon!

NAME: Person_1
You warned him.

NAME: Person_3
You are under arrest. You have the right to
remain silent.

NAME: Person_1
Will you relax?

NAME: Person_8
Do you know how much that hurts?

NAME: Person_1
Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
another one.

NAME: Person_1
Edwards?

NAME: Person_3
Uh, this. This is what I saw.

NAME: Person_1
You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

NAME: Person_8
He looked all right to me.

NAME: Person_1
A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
Who was the target?

NAME: Person_8
I don't know.

NAME: Person_1
Jeebs!

NAME: Person_8
I don't know!

NAME: Person_1
This is all confiscated. All of it. I want
you on the next transport off this rock. Or
I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

NAME: Person_3
The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

NAME: Person_1
Searching for a handle on the moment here?
A place to file all this.

NAME: Person_3
See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
grow back.
What's going on?

NAME: Person_1
Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
a thing.

NAME: Person_3
Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
long time.

NAME: Person_1
Ever see one of these?

NAME: Person_1
-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
but this one's eating my popcorn!

NAME: Person_3
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

NAME: Person_3
Where am I?

NAME: Person_1
See what I mean about tequila? You're a
bright young man, James. Just lay off the
sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
sharp.

NAME: Side_22
Another beer?

NAME: Person_3
Coffee. Please.

NAME: Person_6
Figures.

NAME: Person_9
What is it, Edgar?!

NAME: Person_6
Get your big butt back in that house!

NAME: Person_6
You can have my gun when you pry it from my
cold, dead fingers!

NAME: Person_9
What on earth was it?!

NAME: Person_6
Sugar.

NAME: Person_9
I've never seen sugar do that.

NAME: Person_6
Give me sugar.

NAME: Person_6
In water.

NAME: Person_6
More.

NAME: Person_9
Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
hanging off your bones!

NAME: Person_6
That better?

NAME: Side_15
Help you?

NAME: Person_3
Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

NAME: Side_15
Elevator. Push the "call" button.

NAME: Person_5
You're late. Sit down.

NAME: Person_5
My name is Zed. You're all here because
you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

NAME: Person_5
And we're looking for one of you. Just one.
What will follow is a series of simple
tests designed to quantify motor skills,
hand-eye coordination, concentration,
stamina -- I see we have a question.

NAME: Person_3
Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
we doing this?

NAME: Person_5
Son?

NAME: Side_23
Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
honors. We're here because you're looking
for the best of the best of the best, sir!

NAME: Person_5
What's so funny, Edwards?

NAME: Person_3
I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
the best of the best of the best of the --"
(realizing nobody is with
him on this)
It just struck me as --
Humorous. Sir.

NAME: Person_5
Okay. Let's get going.

NAME: Person_3
Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
doing here?

NAME: Side_24
Looking for the best of the best of the best.

NAME: Person_3
Well, yeah, I know, but...

NAME: Person_5
The hell happened?

NAME: Person_3
Hesitated, sir.

NAME: Person_5
May I ask why you felt little Tiffany
deserved to die?

NAME: Person_3
She was the only one who actually seemed
dangerous. At the time.

NAME: Person_5
And how did you come to that conclusion?

NAME: Person_3
Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
not his head. His head is that butt-ugly
bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
the girl's books were way too advanced for
an eight-year-old's. And besides, from
where I'm looking, she was the only one who
appeared to have a motive. And I don't
appreciate your jumping down my throat about
it.

NAME: Person_3
Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

NAME: Person_5
He's got a real problem with authority.

NAME: Person_1
So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

NAME: Person_5
I hope you know what you're doing.

NAME: Person_5
Congratulations, you're everything we've
come to expect from years of government
training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
have one more test to administer, an eye
exam.

NAME: Person_3
You! Hey, what's goin' on?

NAME: Person_1
Back in the mid-fifties, the government
started a little underfunded agency with
the simple and laughable purpose of making
contact with a race not of this planet.

NAME: Person_5
Now, if you'll look directly at the end of
this device.

NAME: Person_1
Everybody thought the agency was a joke.
Except the aliens. They made contact on
March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

NAME: Person_1
There were nine of us that night. Seven
agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

NAME: Person_3
You brought the aliens flowers?

NAME: Person_1
They were intergalactic refugees with a
simple request. Let us use the earth as an
apolitical zone for people without a
planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
evidence of their landing.

NAME: Person_3
The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

NAME: Person_1
Why else would we hold it in Queens?
Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
They live among us, in secret.

NAME: Person_3
I see. Not to change the subject, but when
was your last cat-scan?

NAME: Person_1
Every six months; it's company policy.

NAME: Person_3
Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
while we're right here.

NAME: Person_1
Don't tell me we've only got that powdered
shit for cream again?

NAME: Person_1
Oh.

NAME: Person_1
For future reference, this is a better look
for you.

NAME: Person_1
Any given time, around fifteen hundred
landed aliens are on the planet, the
majority right here in Manhattan. Most
aliens are decent enough, just trying to
make a living.

NAME: Person_3
Cab drivers?

NAME: Person_1
Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
most part, don't have a clue. Don't want
one, either. They're happy. They think
they've got a pretty good bead on things.

NAME: Person_3
Why the big secret? People are smart, they
can handle it.

NAME: Person_1
A person is smart. People are dumb.
Everything they've ever "known" has been
proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
was the center of the universe. Five
hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
tomorrow.

NAME: Person_3
So what's the catch?

NAME: Person_1
What you'll gain in perspective, you'll
lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
You give up everything. Sever every human
contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

NAME: Person_3
Nobody?

NAME: Person_1
You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
There.  That's the speech I never heard.
That's the choice I never got.

NAME: Person_3
Hold up. You track me down, put me through
those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

NAME: Person_1
You got 'til sun-up.

NAME: Person_3
Is it worth it?

NAME: Person_1
You find out, you let me know.

NAME: Side_10
Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
Think we own the place?

NAME: Side_10
Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

NAME: Side_10
Takin' care of your pest problem.

NAME: Person_6
"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

NAME: Side_10
Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

NAME: Person_6
You know, I have noticed an infestation
here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
pond scum. So convinced of their own
superiority as they scurry about their
short, pointless lives.

NAME: Side_10
Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
'em?

NAME: Person_6
In the worst way.

NAME: Person_3
One thing you gotta know right now.

NAME: Person_3
All right. I'm in because there's some
next-level shit going on around here, and
I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
are a couple of things we need to get
straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
the skills. So as of now you can cease with
all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
"sport." Cool?

NAME: Person_1
Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

NAME: Person_1
As of this moment, they don't mean much.

NAME: Side_13
Purpose of trip?

NAME: Side_3
Diplomatic mission.

NAME: Side_13
Duration of stay?

NAME: Side_3
Lunch.

NAME: Side_13
Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

NAME: Person_1
Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

NAME: Person_1
A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
flight would get on anybody's nerves.

NAME: Person_3
What branch of the government do we report
to?

NAME: Person_1
None. They started asking too many questions.

NAME: Person_3
So who pays for all this?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

NAME: Person_1
Here. A new recording device to replace
CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
again?
This is amusing. Universal translator.

NAME: Person_1
We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
you why.  Human thought is so primitive
it's considered an infectious disease.
Makes you proud, doesn't it?

NAME: Person_3
What's this?

NAME: Person_1
Don't touch that!

NAME: Person_1
Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
was funny as hell.

NAME: Person_3
Sorry!

NAME: Person_1
Observation, the heart of our little
endeavor.

NAME: Person_1
This map shows the location of every
registered alien on earth at any given
time. Some of them we keep under constant
surveillance.

NAME: Person_1
Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
public -- normal. In private -- you'll get
the idea.

NAME: Person_1
Meet the twins.

NAME: Person_3
I gotta be honest about something.

NAME: Person_1
It makes no sense?

NAME: Person_3
It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
from, like, Venus or something.

NAME: Person_1
Mrs. Edelson.

NAME: Person_1
Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

NAME: Person_5
What's your jacket size, Edwards?

NAME: Person_3
Uh -- forty regular.

NAME: Person_5
Then let's put it on.

NAME: Person_3
Put what on?

NAME: Person_5
The last suit you'll ever wear.

NAME: Person_2
The difference between you and me?

NAME: Person_2
I make this look good.

NAME: Person_5
Okay, let's see.
Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
Sinalee touching down in the forest outside
Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

NAME: Side_25
Humanoid?

NAME: Person_5
You wish. Bring a sponge.
What else -- everybody, we gotta keep
Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

NAME: Person_5
Red-letter from last night -- we had an
un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
New York farm country. Keep your ears open
for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
galactic kegger down here.

NAME: Person_5
Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

NAME: Person_1
Landed alien out of zone.
Who is it?

NAME: Person_5
Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
don't you take Jay? This is a good one for
him to warm up on.

NAME: Person_2
Yo, wussup with Zed?
"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
intergalactic kegger..."

NAME: Person_1
Zed was saving the world before you were
born, son. Show some respect.

NAME: Person_2
We got the use of unlimited technology from
the entire universe and we cruise around in
this?

NAME: Person_1
Seat belt.

NAME: Person_2
You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
people. You could be a little kinder and
gentler.

NAME: Person_1
Buckle up, please.

NAME: Person_2
Now did that hurt?

NAME: Person_1
Makin' fun of my ride...

NAME: Person_1
Jay. The button?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah?

NAME: Person_1
Never push the button, Jay.

NAME: Person_1
License and registration, please.

NAME: Person_1
Other license and registration, please.

NAME: Person_1
Your resident card has you restricted to
the five boroughs only. Where do you think
you're going?

NAME: Side_7
It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

NAME: Person_1
Oh God. How soon?

NAME: Person_1
Okay. All right. No big deal.
You handle it.

NAME: Person_2
Me?

NAME: Person_1
Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

NAME: Side_7
Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
you something.

NAME: Person_2
Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

NAME: Person_1
Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
You were headed out of town.

NAME: Side_7
Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

NAME: Person_2
Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
that?!

NAME: Person_1
So? Who you meeting?

NAME: Side_7
Well, it's -- a ship.

NAME: Person_1
Really? I didn't see a departure clearance
for today.

NAME: Side_7
You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

NAME: Person_2
Guys -- guys --

NAME: Person_1
Doin' fine, Ace.
What kind of emergency? What's the rush to
get off the planet all of a sudden?

NAME: Person_2
Help?! HELP! Hello?!

NAME: Side_7
We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
Some of the -- new arrivals.

NAME: Person_1
What new arrivals? This have anything to do
with the crasher from last night?

NAME: Person_2
Can you guys do this later?!

NAME: Person_2
Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

NAME: Person_1
Congratulations! It's a lizard.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, you know, it is sorta --

NAME: Person_1
Anything about that seem unusual to you?

NAME: Person_2
Pick.

NAME: Person_1
What kind of "new arrival" would scare
Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
with a newborn?
Let's check the hot sheets.

NAME: Person_2
These are the hot sheets?

NAME: Person_1
Best damn investigative reporting on the
planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
York Times if you want. They get lucky
sometimes.

NAME: Person_2
You're actually looking for tips in a
supermarket tabloid?

NAME: Person_1
Not looking for. Found.

NAME: Person_1
Not so fast. Walk up slow.

NAME: Person_2
Why?

NAME: Person_1
Part of the routine. Makes it look like
we're sizing up the situation. Gives her
time to get the wrong impression.

NAME: Person_1
Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
smoother.

NAME: Person_9
Can I help you gentlemen?

NAME: Person_1
How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
few questions about your visitor.

NAME: Person_9
Are you here to make fun of me too?

NAME: Person_1
No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense
of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we
come in?

NAME: Person_9
Sure. Lemonade?

NAME: Person_9
And they said to me, "If he was murdered,
how could he walk back in the house?" And I
must admit, I was a little stumped by that
one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
It was more like something else that was
wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

NAME: Person_2
Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
alien...

NAME: Person_9
Sorry?

NAME: Person_1
Go on.

NAME: Person_9
Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

NAME: Person_1
Did he say anything?

NAME: Person_9
Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
remember.

NAME: Person_1
Sugar water.

NAME: Person_2
Did you taste her lemonade?

NAME: Person_1
Ray Bans.
(pulling off Jay's
sunglasses)
Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the
flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was
trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
the light from Venus --

NAME: Person_2
Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
give her a new one?

NAME: Person_1
Standard issue neuralyzer.

NAME: Person_2
And that's the best you can come up with?

NAME: Person_1
On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar
ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at
your mother's for a few days and get over
it. Decide you're better off.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked
him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
decorator or something...

NAME: Person_2
Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those
memory things?

NAME: Person_1
When you're ready.
Please -- not green.

NAME: Person_1
Do you know what alien life form leaves a
green spectral trail?

NAME: Person_2
Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
question on Final Jeopardy last night.

NAME: Person_1
Zed, we have a bug.

NAME: Person_2
I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
that this is bad. Right?

NAME: Person_1
Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They
consume, infest and destroy. They live off
the death and decay of other species.

NAME: Person_2
So basically you have a racial problem with
all insect-based life forms?

NAME: Person_1
Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
five times smarter than Albert Einstein,
four times stronger than an ox, nine times
meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
around Manhattan Island in his brand new
Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

NAME: Person_2
What do we do?

NAME: Person_1
With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

NAME: Side_8
Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
planet are terrible.

NAME: Side_3
Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

NAME: Side_8
Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

NAME: Side_3
Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
the planet.

NAME: Side_8
A bug? He must know why I'm here.

NAME: Side_3
We think he does.
(noticing the ornate box
on the table)
Is that what I think it is?

NAME: Side_8
No, just some diamonds for your children.
Do we have time to eat?

NAME: Side_3
Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

NAME: Side_26
Table six is up!

NAME: Side_3
To the continued reign of the Arquillian
Empire.

NAME: Side_8
To the safety of the galaxy.

NAME: Side_8
You can kill us both -- but you will not
find it.

NAME: Person_6
You're right about one thing.

NAME: Side_9
What am I supposed to do with the cat?

NAME: Side_6
I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
family claim it.

NAME: Side_9
Where do you want contestant number three?

NAME: Person_4
By the wall, I guess.
What's with the cat?

NAME: Side_9
Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
Sign here.

NAME: Person_4
What's the problem with the cat?

NAME: Side_9
Your problem.

NAME: Person_4
Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
His is worse.

NAME: Person_4
Okey-dokey. Shall we?

NAME: Person_4
Oh, my God.

NAME: Person_4
...approximately 112 degrees at time of
autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a
post-mortem increase in body temperature.
Examiner attempted to verify result
rectally, only to find subject was, uh,
without rectum. Which can only be described
as...well...as really...

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
going to need to see some ID.

NAME: Person_4
You boys must not have much of a home life.

NAME: Person_1
We watch the morgues very carefully. You've
got something unusual?

NAME: Person_4
I'd say so -- triple homicide.

NAME: Person_4
The first corpse was perfectly normal,
except that he was broken in half, but when
I opened up the other two -- well, look.

NAME: Person_4
There's a skeletal structure at work here
unlike anything I've ever seen.

NAME: Person_1
I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
other body?

NAME: Person_4
This way, Doctor.

NAME: Person_4
This one's even stranger. I did a full
laparotomy. I started with the lesser
curvature of the stomach -- though, if you
want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal
junction.

NAME: Person_2
I think, uh, we should start at the same
place you did.

NAME: Person_4
All right.

NAME: Person_2
Your cat?

NAME: Person_4
Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

NAME: Person_4
Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't
mind.

NAME: Person_4
You have very pretty eyes.

NAME: Person_2
Thank-you, but is this really the time to
uh -- you know, come on to me?

NAME: Person_4
Hey, just walking the dog.
Feel that? Where the piloric junction would
be?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, yes. Exactly.

NAME: Person_4
Now push that aside. Notice anything
strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

NAME: Person_2
Nope. All fine.

NAME: Person_4
Doctor, they're all missing.

NAME: Person_2
Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing
out is that there are no pieces of them
left. So they're intact, wherever they are.
That we can be sure of.

NAME: Person_4
Have we met before? I have the strangest
feeling of deja vu.

NAME: Person_2
You know, I was just going to ask you the
same thing.

NAME: Person_4
Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's
already under enough stress.
This body is not really a body, but it's
actually some sort of transport unit for
something else altogether. The question is:
what?

NAME: Person_4
By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

NAME: Person_2
No, no...not at all.

NAME: Person_4
You know what I like to do sometimes? When
it's really late?

NAME: Person_2
No...

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me.

NAME: Person_1
What do you think?

NAME: Person_2
Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
Undead thing goin' on.

NAME: Person_1
Of the body.

NAME: Person_2
Great body.

NAME: Person_1
The dead body?

NAME: Person_2
Not a clue.

NAME: Person_1
All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to
sound too dumb.

NAME: Person_4
Dr. White.

NAME: Person_4
Dr. White.
Dr. White.

NAME: Person_4
NAME: Person_1
You're up, Slugger.

NAME: Person_4
Look at this.

NAME: Person_2
What is that?

NAME: Person_4
Far -- freaking -- out.

NAME: Side_16
Must -- to pre -- prevent --
-- contest? No...to prevent --

NAME: Person_2
It's all right -- What are you trying to
say? Struggle?

NAME: Person_4
War?

NAME: Side_16
Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --
What is word? Be...?

NAME: Person_2
Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

NAME: Person_2
"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's
Belt?"  The hell does that mean?
Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come
here!

NAME: Person_4
"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the
Department of Public Health, are you?

NAME: Person_2
He's dead.

NAME: Person_1
Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

NAME: Person_2
You knew him?

NAME: Person_1
One of the few I actually liked. Exiled
High Prince.

NAME: Person_4
I was right -- this is an alien life form,
and you're from some government agency who
wants to keep it under wraps...

NAME: Person_2
He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on
Orion's Belt."

NAME: Person_4
... This make total sense. How else do you
explain New York? The other night I'm in a
cab, this guy...

NAME: Person_1
He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?
That makes no sense.

NAME: Person_2
That's what he said.
Didn't he? Right after he --
Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy
thing already.

NAME: Person_4
Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid
I'm going to need to see some ID if you're
going to be in the morgue, okay?

NAME: Person_1
Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

NAME: Person_2
Stop that --

NAME: Person_1
Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

NAME: Person_2
-- that thing probably gives you brain
cancer!

NAME: Person_1
Never hurt her before.

NAME: Person_2
"Never hurt her before"?! How many times
have you done the flashy thing to this poor
woman?!

NAME: Person_1
Couple.

NAME: Person_2
Aren't you worried about, you know, long
term damage?

NAME: Person_1
Little bit.

NAME: Person_2
What the hell happened to make you such a
callous son of a bitch?

NAME: Person_1
I took this job.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,
did you?

NAME: Person_1
Nah.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in
charge of the flashy memory thing
department.

NAME: Person_1
Not while I'm around, Slim.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, well you're a menace with that
thing...

NAME: Person_1
We've got two dead aliens in there, and a
deputy medical coroner in need of a new
memory.

NAME: Person_6
No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

NAME: Person_2
Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around
here?

NAME: Person_5
The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
psychotic episode.

NAME: Person_5
Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of
stars in the northern sky...
and here's Orion's belt --

NAME: Person_2
That's what the little guy was talking
about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
Orion's belt..."

NAME: Person_5
There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
belt is just these three stars; galaxies
are huge, made up of billions of stars.
(switches off the laser
pointer)
You heard wrong.

NAME: Person_2
You're attracted to me, aren't you?

NAME: Side_27
Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

NAME: Person_2
Pretty lady...

NAME: Person_2
Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
ever get married?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Side_28
Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

NAME: Person_2
Well, it's better to have loved and lost
than never to have --

NAME: Person_1
Try it.

NAME: Person_1
They're leaving.

NAME: Person_5
We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
Redgick was just the beginning.

NAME: Person_2
What do they know that we don't know?

NAME: Person_1
Why do rats desert the ship?
Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
of Manhattan.

NAME: Person_1
Four hundred.

NAME: Person_1
Four thousand.

NAME: Person_1
That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

NAME: Person_2
And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

NAME: Person_1
Message coming in.

NAME: Person_1
Speak of the devil.

NAME: Person_2
They sound pissed.

NAME: Person_5
Translate that and step on it!
Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
see what you can turn up.

NAME: Person_5
And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

NAME: Person_2
I like that.

NAME: Person_1
Series four de-atomizer.

NAME: Person_1
Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

NAME: Person_2
You get a series four de-atomizer and I get
a "Noisy Cricket?!"
I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

NAME: Person_6
That's my truck!

NAME: Side_5
And make sure you tell them that at the
impound.

NAME: Side_5
I got worse.

NAME: Person_2
Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
jewels?

NAME: Person_1
Someone who's not looking for jewels.

NAME: Person_2
This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

NAME: Person_2
Kay! GET DOWN!

NAME: Person_2
The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
from the picture! That's him!

NAME: Person_1
Damn it.

NAME: Person_1
We do not discharge our weapons in view of
the public.

NAME: Person_2
Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
the world if we don't...

NAME: Person_1
There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
plague about to wipe out life on this
planet, and the only thing that lets people
get on with their hopeful little lives is
that they don't know about it.

NAME: Person_1
Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
town. We've got his ship.

NAME: Person_1
Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

NAME: Person_5
Containment may be a moot point, my friend.
The exodus continues. It's like the party's
over and the last one to leave gets stuck
with the check.

NAME: Person_5
You sorry little ingrates!

NAME: Person_5
We've only translated a part of the message
so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

NAME: Person_5
Oh, it gets better... They're holding us
responsible.

NAME: Person_5
Another contestant has entered the ring.

NAME: Person_1
All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
need help. A professional. Someone with
years of experience in intergalactic
politics. I just hope the little prick
hasn't skipped town.

NAME: Person_6
Where do you keep your dead?

NAME: Side_17
I don't have any dead.

NAME: Person_6
Where?!

NAME: Side_17
I don't know, the city morgue!

NAME: Person_2
Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

NAME: Side_1
You don't like it, you can kiss my furry
little butt.

NAME: Person_1
You busy, Frank?

NAME: Side_1
Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my
ride's leaving in --

NAME: Person_1
Call the pound. We got a stray.

NAME: Side_1
Hey! Get your paws off me!

NAME: Person_2
The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

NAME: Person_1
Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

NAME: Side_1
I know nothing.

NAME: Person_1
Not a thing?

NAME: Side_1
Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
a galaxy. They thought he would be safe
here on earth.

NAME: Person_1
And the bug had other plans.

NAME: Side_1
The galaxy is the best source for subatomic
energy in the universe. If the bugs get
their slimy claws on it, kiss the
Arquillians goodbye.

NAME: Person_2
Ask him about the belt.

NAME: Person_1
Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,
Frank?

NAME: Side_1
Beats me.

NAME: Person_2
They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

NAME: Side_1
The galaxy is here.

NAME: Person_1
Here?

NAME: Person_2
The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
and planets? How's it here?

NAME: Side_1
You humans, when're you gonna learn that
size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's
important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
small.

NAME: Person_1
How small?

NAME: Side_1
Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked
before the flight.

NAME: Person_1
Get out of here.
The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

NAME: Person_2
Kay...

NAME: Person_4
Boy, when you want attention --

NAME: Person_4
What's this?

NAME: Person_4
Wow.

NAME: Person_2
So two galaxies have been fighting for
years. And the only people who've been
benefiting are a race of creatures called
bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make
peace...and the bugs send this guy down to
make sure the fighting never stops.

NAME: Person_1
By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
galaxy they've been fighting about.

NAME: Person_2
And if we don't get it back before he
leaves the planet...we're history.

NAME: Person_1
We're not even history. 'Cause history
implies there's someone around to remember
it.

NAME: Side_4
Thank you for making sure the bell works.

NAME: Side_4
What's up, Farmer John?

NAME: Person_6
A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

NAME: Side_4
And this means what to me?

NAME: Person_6
He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
believe he had an animal with him. A gift
I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
me. I would like it back.

NAME: Side_4
I'll need a picture ID, written proof of
ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
kinship with --

NAME: Side_4
-- the deceased.

NAME: Person_6
Don't -- do that.

NAME: Side_4
Do what?

NAME: Side_4
Shit!

NAME: Person_2
I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

NAME: Person_1
What the hell for?

NAME: Person_2
Because all we have to do is walk in and
get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you
go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on
her and flash your brain ray in her face
and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
some shit. The woman's a doctor, she
doesn't need you erasing half her med
school classes. Take me five minutes.

NAME: Person_1
Two minutes!

NAME: Person_6
Where is the animal?!

NAME: Person_4
I told you, I don't know, it ran under some
equipment! Over there.

NAME: Person_6
Get it!

NAME: Person_2
Uh, hi.

NAME: Person_4
Hello.

NAME: Person_2
I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
precinct. They brought a cat in here with a
corpse the other day, might have said
"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

NAME: Person_4
Yes. That's right.

NAME: Person_2
Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
witness in a murder case and I'm going to
need to take it with me.

NAME: Person_4
I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

NAME: Person_2
You don't?

NAME: Person_4
No.
(lowers her voice to a
whisper)
Maybe you could take me with you instead.

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me?

NAME: Person_4
I said, maybe you could take me with you
instead.

NAME: Person_2
Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

NAME: Person_4
I'd really like to go with you. Now.

NAME: Person_2
And, uh, why exactly is that?

NAME: Person_4
I just do.

NAME: Person_4
I have something I need to show you.

NAME: Person_2
Now slow down, you don't have to hit the
gas like that.

NAME: Person_4
You don't understand. You really need to
see this.

NAME: Person_2
And I will. But we gotta get something
straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
I'm used to doing things, okay?

NAME: Person_4
Look, Stud, I don't know how many more
times I'm going to get to tell you this.
There's something --

NAME: Person_4
-- that you have to help me with.

NAME: Person_1
Freeze it, Bug!

NAME: Person_2
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

NAME: Person_4
CHRIST, are you THICK!

NAME: Person_2
How was I supposed to know!?!

NAME: Person_4
What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

NAME: Person_2
Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
prom date!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
shows the slightest hint of sexual
independence, men just --

NAME: Person_6
Everybody shut UP!

NAME: Person_1
Let her go, Shit Eater.

NAME: Person_6
Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
right?!

NAME: Person_1
You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
to your left and I'll solve all your
problems.

NAME: Person_6
That's better. Now put down your weapons.
We're leaving.

NAME: Person_6
Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

NAME: Person_6
Would you care to see the fly get even?

NAME: Person_1
How far you think you'll get without your
ship? If that's what you call that hunk of
space crap we've got back at our office.

NAME: Person_6
Put the weapons down!

NAME: Person_1
Never gonna happen, Insect.

NAME: Person_2
It's okay, Laurel!

NAME: Person_4
HOW is it okay?!

NAME: Person_2
I mean it's going to be okay!

NAME: Person_6
Don't bet on it, meat sack.

NAME: Person_1
Damn it!

NAME: Person_6
Take me here.

NAME: Person_4
What???

NAME: Person_2
They're in a cab.

NAME: Person_2
Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

NAME: Person_1
Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the
planet in a cab.

NAME: Person_1
Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's
not leaving the island.

NAME: Person_1
What've we got from our friends upstairs?

NAME: Person_5
Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
we've got his ship. He's got to be looking
for a way out.

NAME: Person_5
Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
have a galactic standard week to respond.

NAME: Person_2
A galactic standard week? How the hell long
is that?

NAME: Person_1
One hour.

NAME: Person_2
One hour?

NAME: Person_5
To keep the bugs from getting it, the
Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and
whatever planet it's on.

NAME: Person_2
You're talking about US!

NAME: Person_5
Sucks, doesn't it?

NAME: Person_1
Pull up the locations of all land-based
interstellar vehicles.

NAME: Person_5
They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
last ship on the planet.

NAME: Person_1
Atlantic City?

That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

Uh, gentlemen.

NAME: Person_2
Hey. Old guys.

NAME: Person_2
Do those still work?

NAME: Person_6
You're coming with me.

NAME: Person_4
What?! Why?!

NAME: Person_6
It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

NAME: Person_1
Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

NAME: Person_2
You're taking the tunnel?!

NAME: Person_1
You know a better way to Queens?

NAME: Person_2
It's usually jammed?!

NAME: Person_2
I told you!

NAME: Person_1
Jay. The button?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah?!

NAME: Person_1
Push the button, Jay.

NAME: Person_1
And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

NAME: Person_1
Mind if I smoke?

NAME: Person_2
What?!?

NAME: Person_1
In the car, I mean.

NAME: Person_2
I don't care!!

NAME: Person_1
Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
some people if you smoke in a car.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
should quit. I've tried. Never took,
though. I'm beginning to think I lack
self-control.

NAME: Person_1
Well, back to work.

NAME: Person_4
Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
me. I'm a very important person on my
planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
There are those who worship me, yes. I'm
not trying to impress you with this, I'm
just letting you know. It could start a
war.

NAME: Person_6
Good. War means food for my family, all
seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
of mouths to feed, your highness.

NAME: Person_4
You're a wonderful dad.

NAME: Person_2
You know how to work that?

NAME: Person_1
No idea whatsoever.

NAME: Person_1
Let's bag us some bug.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, shit.

NAME: Person_1
Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
implosion factor --

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
Press the little green button, on three.

NAME: Person_1
One...two...

NAME: Person_6
You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

NAME: Person_1
You are under arrest for violating number
4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
over any galaxy you might be carrying.

NAME: Person_6
You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
few seconds you won't even be matter!

NAME: Person_1
Move away from the vehicle and put your
hands on your head.

NAME: Person_6
Put my hands on my head?

NAME: Side_18
Like this?

NAME: Person_2
That did not go at all like I had planned.

NAME: Person_1
This guy's really starting to bug me.

NAME: Person_1
Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
that ship.

NAME: Person_2
Where are you going?

NAME: Person_1
Getting my gun back.

NAME: Person_2
What!?

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Bug!

NAME: Person_1
I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

NAME: Person_1
You're just a smear on the sports page to
me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
parasite! Eat me!

NAME: Person_2
Hey! Come over here and try that!

NAME: Person_2
Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on
your waxy, pointed ass!

NAME: Person_2
What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
and fight like an arthropod!

NAME: Person_2
You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
you're a badass in your hive, but this is
New York City. You're just another tourist
here!

NAME: Person_2
You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

NAME: Person_2
Hey, Bug!

NAME: Person_2
If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
yours.

NAME: Person_2
Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

NAME: Person_2
What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
'Help me! Help me!'

NAME: Person_2
Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
that is!

NAME: Side_18
Don't do that!

NAME: Person_2
That's your Momma!

NAME: Person_2
Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
more than you can chew?

NAME: Person_2
You son of a --

NAME: Person_1
Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
have the galaxy.

NAME: Person_5
I think the word's already out. Our friends
are coming back.
Got an authorized landing at Times Square.
You and Jay check it out on the way back...
And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
celebrating.

NAME: Person_1
You were saying?

NAME: Person_2
Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

NAME: Person_1
Worked.

NAME: Person_2
After I got the shit beat out of me!

NAME: Person_1
And I almost got digested. It goes with the
job.

NAME: Person_2
You coulda told me what you were doing.

NAME: Person_1
There wasn't time, sport!

NAME: Person_4
Interesting job you guys got.

NAME: Side_5
Damn bugs.

NAME: Person_2
Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
don't have to flashy thing her.

NAME: Person_2
Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
hangs out with dead people.

NAME: Person_1
Not her. Me.
They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
I never just look anymore and they're
beautiful.

NAME: Person_2
Kay, you're scaring your partner.

NAME: Person_1
I haven't been training a partner -- I've
been training a replacement.

NAME: Person_2
Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

NAME: Person_4
Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
We're not even on the right island.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe you won't have to.

NAME: Person_1
Days. Months. Years. Always face it
forwards.

NAME: Person_1
I've just been down the gullet of an
interstellar cockroach. That's one of a
hundred memories I don't want.

NAME: Person_1
See you around, sport.

NAME: Person_2
No, you won't.

NAME: Side_29
NAME: Side_30

And here's another one:

And a third:

NAME: Side_19
Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
Bulls game.

NAME: Person_2
I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
planet.

NAME: Side_19
Let's roll.

NAME: Person_9
Blood, blood, blood!

NAME: Person_9
And death.

NAME: Person_9
Back then, the world was divided in
two. Vicious predator or Meek prey.

NAME: Person_9 (O.S.)
But over time, we evolved, and
moved beyond our primitive savage
ways.

NAME: Person_9
Now, predator and prey live in
harmony.

NAME: Person_9
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

NAME: Side_21
Yeah, I don't have to cower in a
herd anymore.

NAME: Side_21
Instead I can be an astronaut.

NAME: Side_35
I don't have to be a lonely hunter
any more.

NAME: Side_36
Today I can hunt for tax
exemptions. I'm gonna be an
actuary!

NAME: Person_9
And I can make the world a better
place! I am going to be...

NAME: Person_9
A police officer!

NAME: Side_3
Bunny cop. That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

NAME: Person_9
It may seem impossible to small
minds--
I'm looking at you Gideon Grey.

NAME: Person_9
But just 211 miles away stands the
great city of Zootopia! Where our
ancestors first joined together in
peace, and declared that anyone can
be anything! Thank you and good
night!

NAME: STU Person_1
Judy, you ever wonder how your mom
and me got to be so darn happy?

NAME: Person_9
Nope.

NAME: STU Person_1
Well, we gave up on our dreams and
we settled, right Bon?

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Oh yes, that's right, Stu. We
settled hard.

NAME: STU Person_1
See, that's the beauty of
complacency, Jude. If you don't try
anything new, you'll never fail.

NAME: Person_9
I like trying, actually.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
What your father means, hon, is
it's gonna be difficult--
impossible even-- for you to become
a police officer.

NAME: STU Person_1
Right. There's never been a bunny
cop.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
No.

NAME: STU Person_1
Bunnies don't do that.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Never.

NAME: STU Person_1
Never.

NAME: Person_9
Oh. Then I guess I'll have to be
the first one. Because I am gonna
make the world...
(parkours against a
vendor's stand)
A better place!

NAME: STU Person_1
OR... um, heck, you wanna talk
about making the world a better
place--

NAME: STU Person_1
--no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Yes! Your dad, me, your 275
brothers and sisters-- we're
changing the world.

NAME: STU Person_1
Yep.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
One carrot at a time...

NAME: STU Person_1
Amen to that. Carrot farming is a
noble profession.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
You get it. I mean, it's great to
have dreams.

NAME: STU Person_1
Yeah, just as long as you don't
believe in em too much.
(finally noticing Judy's
absence)
Where in the heck'd she go?

NAME: Side_3
Gimme your tickets right now, or
I'm gonna kick your meek little
sheep butt.

NAME: Side_16
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!

NAME: Side_3
Baa-baa. What're ya gonna do, cry?

NAME: Person_9
You heard her. Cut it out.

NAME: Side_3
Nice costume, loser. What crazy
world are you living in where you
think a bunny could be a cop?

NAME: Person_9
Kindly return my friends' tickets.

NAME: Side_3
Come and get `em.... But watch out,
`cause I'm a fox-- and like you
said in your dumb little stage
play, us predators used to eat
prey. And that killer instinct's
still in our Dunnahh.

NAME: Side_22
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's
pronounced D-N-A.

NAME: Side_3
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

NAME: Person_9
You don't scare me, Gideon.

NAME: Side_3
You scared now?

NAME: Side_22
Lookit her nose twitch. She is
scared!

NAME: Side_3
Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry --

NAME: Side_3
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do
ya?

NAME: Side_3
I want you to remember this moment--
the next time you think you will
ever be anything more than just a
stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.

NAME: Side_23
That looks bad.

NAME: Side_16
Are you okay, Judy?

NAME: Person_9
Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay.

NAME: Person_9
Here you go.

NAME: Side_16
Wow! You got our tickets!

NAME: Side_23
You're awesome, Judy!

NAME: Side_16
Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know
what he's talkin' `bout.

NAME: Person_9
Well, he was right about one
thing...

NAME: Person_9
I don't know when to quit.

NAME: Side_9
Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12
unique ecosystems within its city
limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara
Square, Rainforest District, to
name a few. You're gonna have to
master all of them before you hit
the streets-- or guess what?
You'll be dead!

NAME: Side_9
Scorching sandstorm. You're dead,
bunny bumpkin!

NAME: Side_1
As Mayor of Zootopia, I am proud to
announce that my Mammal Inclusion
Initiative has produced its first
police academy graduate.

NAME: Side_1
Valedictorian of her class, ZPD's
very first rabbit officer... Judy
Hopps.

NAME: Side_1
Assistant Mayor Bellwether? Her
badge.

NAME: Person_5
Oh! Yes right.

NAME: Side_1
Thank you.

NAME: Side_1
Judy, it is my great privilege to
officially assign you to the heart
of Zootopia: Precinct One, City
Center.

NAME: Person_5
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

NAME: Side_5
I won't let you down. This has been
my dream since I was a kid.

NAME: Person_5
Ya know, it's a... It's a real
proud day for us little guys.

NAME: Side_1
Bellwether, make room will ya? Come
on.

NAME: Side_1
Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see
those teeth!

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
We're real proud of you, Judy.

NAME: STU Person_1
Yeah. Scared, too.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Yes.

NAME: STU Person_1
Really, it's kind of a proud-scared
combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so
far a away... It's such a big city.

NAME: Side_5
Guys-- I've been working for this
my whole life.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
We know. And we're just a little
excited for you, but terrified.

NAME: Side_5
The only thing we have to fear is
fear itself.

NAME: STU Person_1
And also bears. We have bears to
fear, too. To say nothing of lions,
and wolves...

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Wolves?

NAME: STU Person_1
...weasels...

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
You play cribbage with a weasel.

NAME: STU Person_1
And he cheats like there's no
tomorrow. You know what, pretty
much all predators-- and Zootopia's
full of `em.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Oh, Stu.

NAME: STU Person_1
And foxes are the worst.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Actually, your father does have a
point there. It's in their biology.
Remember what happened with Gideon
Grey.

NAME: Side_5
When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a
jerk, who happened to be a fox. I
know plenty of bunnies who are
jerks.

NAME: STU Person_1
Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case, we made you a
little care package to take with
you.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
And I put some snacks in there.

NAME: STU Person_1
This is fox deterrent.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Yeah that's safe to have there.

NAME: STU Person_1
This is fox repellent...

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Okay, the deterrent and the
repellent. That's all she needs.

NAME: STU Person_1
Check this out!

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Oh for goodness sake. She has no
need for a fox taser, Stu.

NAME: STU Person_1
Oh c'mon. When is there not a need
for a fox taser?

NAME: Side_5
Okay, look-- I will take this to
make you stop talking.

NAME: STU Person_1
Terrific! Everyone wins!

NAME: Side_37
Arriving-- Zootopia Express!

NAME: Side_5
OK. Gotta go. Bye!

NAME: Side_5
I love you guys.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Love you, too!

NAME: STU Person_1
Oh cripes, here come the
waterworks.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Oh Stu, pull it together.

Don't expect us to apologize for
it.

Greasy walls... rickety bed...

Crazy neighbors...
(big smile as she flops on
the bed)
I love it!

NAME: Side_26
C'mon! He bared his teeth first.

NAME: Person_7
O-M goodness! They really did hire
a bunny. What?!

NAME: Person_7
I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter
than I thought you'd be.

NAME: Person_1
Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know,
but a bunny can call another bunny
"cute," but when other animals do
it, it's a little...

NAME: Person_7
I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin
Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks
is just a flabby, donut-loving cop,
stereotyping you...?

NAME: Person_1
It's okay-- oh, you've actually
you've actually got a-- there's a--
in your neck-- the fold-- the--
there's--

NAME: Person_7
Oh, there you went, you little
dickens!

NAME: Person_1
I should get to roll call, so...
which way do I?

NAME: Person_7
Oh! Bullpen's over there to the
left.

NAME: Person_1
Great, thank you!

NAME: Person_7
Aw... That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

NAME: Person_1
Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to
make the world a better place?

NAME: Person_3
All right, all right. Everybody
sit.

NAME: Person_3
I've got three items on the docket.
First... we need to acknowledge the
elephant in the room.
Francine, happy birthday.

NAME: Person_3
Number two: There are some new
recruits with us I should
introduce. But I'm not going to,
because I don't care. Finally...

NAME: Person_3
...We have 14 missing mammal cases.
All predators, from a giant polar
bear, to a teensy little otter. And
City Hall is right up my tail to
find them. This is priority number
one. Assignments!

NAME: Person_3
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer,
Delgato-- your teams take Missing
Mammals from the Rainforest
District. Officers McHorn,
Rhinowitz, Wolfard, your teams take
Sahara Square. Officers Higgins,
Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And
finally, our first bunny, Officer
Hopps.

NAME: Person_3
Parking Duty. Dismissed!

NAME: Person_1
Parking duty?
Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo?

NAME: Person_1
Sir, you said there were 14 missing
mammal cases?

NAME: Person_3
So.

NAME: Person_1
So I can handle one. You probably
forgot, but I was top of my class
at the academy.

NAME: Person_3
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

NAME: Person_1
Sir, I'm not just some "token"
bunny.

NAME: Person_3
Well, then writing a hundred
tickets a day should be easy.

NAME: Person_1
100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write
100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200
tickets!

NAME: Person_1
Before noon!

NAME: Person_1
Boom! 200 tickets before noon.

NAME: Person_1
Where'd he go...

NAME: Side_7
Listen, I don't know what you're
doing skulking around during
daylight hours, but I don't want
any trouble in here... So hit the
road.

NAME: Person_2
I'm not looking for any trouble
either, sir. I simply want to buy a
Jumbo Pop for my little boy.

NAME: Person_2
You want the red or the blue, pal?

NAME: Person_1
I'm such a...

NAME: Side_7
Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen,
buddy, what? There aren't any fox
ice cream joints in your part of
town?

NAME: Person_2
Uh, no no, there are. There are.
It's just, my boy--
--this goofy little stinker-- he
loves all things elephant. Wants to
be one when he grows up.

NAME: Person_2
Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am
I to crush his little dreams, huh?
Right?

NAME: Side_7
Look, you probably can't read, fox
but the sign says...

NAME: Side_7
NAME: Side_43
(slowly reads SIGN,
belittling)
SERVICE TO ANYONE. So beat it.

NAME: Side_44
You're holding up the line.

NAME: Side_7
Hey, you're gonna have to wait your
turn like everyone else, metermaid.

NAME: Person_1
Actually...
I'm an officer. Just had a quick
question. Are your customers aware
they're getting snot and mucous
with their cookies and cream?

NAME: Side_7
What are you talkin' about?

NAME: Person_1
Well, I don't wanna cause you any
trouble, but I believe scooping ice
cream with an un-gloved trunk is a
Class 3 Health Code Violation...

NAME: Person_1
...Which is kind of a big deal. Of
course-- I could let you off with a
warning if you were to glove those
trunks and, I don't know, finish
selling this nice dad and his son
a... what was it?

NAME: Person_2
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

NAME: Person_1
A Jumbo Pop.

NAME: Side_7
Fifteen dollars.

NAME: Person_2
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't
have my wallet. I'd lose my head if
it weren't attached to my neck,
that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry
pal. Gotta be about the worst
birthday ever. Please don't be mad
at me.
Thanks, anyway.

NAME: Person_1
Keep the change.

NAME: Person_2
Officer, I can't thank you enough.
So kind, really, can I pay you
back?

NAME: Person_1
Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know,
it burns me up to see folks with
such backward attitudes toward
foxes. I just wanna say, you're a
great dad and just a... a real
articulate fella.

NAME: Person_2
Ah, well, that is high praise. It's
rare that I find someone so non-
patronizing... Officer...

NAME: Person_1
Hopps. Mr...

NAME: Person_2
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

NAME: Person_1
And you little guy, you want to be
an elephant when you grow up... you
be an elephant-- because this is
Zootopia, anyone can be anything.

NAME: Person_2
Ah, boy, I tell him that all the
time. All right here ya go--
Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that
smile, that's a happy birthday
smile! All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot toot.

NAME: Person_1
Toot, toot!

NAME: Person_2
Bye now!

NAME: Person_1
Goodbye!

NAME: Person_1
Oh! Hey, little toot toot--

NAME: Person_2
Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles!

NAME: Person_2
Lumber delivery!

NAME: Side_45
What's with the color?

NAME: Person_2
The color? Uh... It's redwood.

NAME: Person_2
39...40. There you go. Way to work
that diaper, big guy. Hey, no kiss
bye-bye for daddy?

NAME: FINPerson_2
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite
your face off. Ciao.

NAME: Person_1
Well. I stood up for you, and you
lied to me. You liar!

NAME: Person_2
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
And I'm not the liar, he is.

NAME: Person_1
Hey!

NAME: Person_1
Alright, slick Nick, you're under
arrest.

NAME: Person_2
Really, for what?

NAME: Person_1
Gee I don't know, how `bout selling
food without a permit, transporting
undeclared commerce across borough
lines, false advertising...

NAME: Person_2
Permit. Receipt of declared
commerce. And I didn't falsely
advertise anything. Take care.

NAME: Person_1
You told that mouse the popsicle
sticks were redwood!

NAME: Person_2
That's right. "Red wood." With a
space in the middle. Wood that is
red.
You can't touch me, Carrots, I been
doing this since I was born.

NAME: Person_1
You're gonna wanna refrain from
calling me Carrots...

NAME: Person_2
My bad. I just naturally assumed
you came from some little carrot-
choked podunk, no?

NAME: Person_1
Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke
County, and I grew up in
Bunnyburrow.

NAME: Person_2
Okay. Tell me if this story sounds
familiar:
Nave little hick with good grades
and big ideas decides, "Hey lookit
me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia--
where Predators and Prey live in
harmony and sing Kumbaya!" Only to
find-- whoopsie, we don't all get
along. And that dream of becoming a
big city cop? Double whoopsie!
She's a meter maid. And whoopsie
number threesie-- NO ONE cares
about her or her dreams. And soon
enough those dreams die and our
bunny sinks into emotional and
literal squalor living in a box
under a bridge. Til finally she has
no choice but to go back home with
that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail
between her legs to become-- you're
from Bunnyburrow, is that what you
said?-- so how `bout a carrot
farmer... That sound about right?

NAME: Person_2
Be careful now, it won't just be
your dreams getting crushed.

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I
can or can't be! Especially not
some jerk who never had the guts to
try to be anything more than a
popsicle hustler!

NAME: Person_2
Alright look, everyone comes to
Zootopia thinking they can be
anything they want. Well you can't.
You can only be what you are.
Sly fox.

NAME: Person_2
Dumb bunny.

NAME: Person_1
I am NOT a dumb bunny.

NAME: Person_2
Right. And that's not wet cement.

NAME: Person_2
You'll never be a real cop. You're
a cute meter maid though. Maybe a
supervisor one day. Hang in
there...

NAME: Person_1
Oh hey, it's my parents!

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart!

NAME: STU Person_1
Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was
your first day on the force?

NAME: Person_1
It was real great.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

NAME: Person_1
Mmm. Absolutely. And more.
Everyone's so nice. And I feel like
I'm really making a difference--

NAME: STU Person_1
Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes,
Bonnie! Look at that!

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you
a meter maid?

NAME: Person_1
Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is
just a temporary thing--

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
It's the safest job on the force!

NAME: STU Person_1
Ah, she's not a real cop! Our
prayers have been answered!

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Glorious day!

NAME: STU Person_1
Meter maid, meter maid!

NAME: Person_1
Dad! Dad--

NAME: STU Person_1
Meter maid, meter maid!

NAME: Person_1
DAD! You know what-- it's been a
really long day, I should really--

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
That's right. You get some rest!

NAME: STU Person_1
Those meters aren't gonna maid
themselves.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Bye bye!

NAME: Person_1
Buh-bye.

NAME: Person_1
Tomorrow's another day...

NAME: Side_46
I was 30 seconds over!

NAME: Side_47
Ugh! Yeah you're a real hero, lady!

NAME: Side_48
My mommy says she wishes you were
dead.

NAME: Person_1
(less convinced with each
utterance)
I am a real cop. I am a real cop. I
am a real cop. I am a real cop...

NAME: Side_27
You! Bunny!

NAME: Person_1
Sir, if you have a grievance, you
may contest your citation in
traffic court.

NAME: Side_27
What're you talking about? My shop!
It was just robbed! Look, he's
getting away! Well are you a cop or
not?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir, I
got this!

NAME: Person_1
Stop! Stop in the name of the law!

NAME: Side_4
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

NAME: Side_4
Whoa. Coming through!

NAME: Side_28
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-

NAME: Person_1
I got dibs! Officer Hopps, I am in
pursuit!

NAME: Person_1
You! Freeze!

NAME: Side_28
(arriving, but too big to
enter)
Hey! Metermaid! Wait for the real
cops!

NAME: Person_1
Stop!

NAME: Person_1
Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through!
`Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon...

NAME: Side_4
Bon voyage, flat foot!

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Stop right there!

NAME: Side_4
Have a donut, coppah!

NAME: Side_8
Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard
print jeggings?
(sees the donut about to
kill her)
Aaaaaaaaaaaagh!

NAME: Person_1
I love your hair.

NAME: Side_8
Aw... thank you.

NAME: Side_4
Come to papa...

NAME: Person_7
Okay, you're gonna have to be
patient and wait in line just like
everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay?

NAME: Person_1
I popped the weasel!

NAME: Person_3
Abandoning your post, inciting a
scurry, reckless endangerment of
rodents... but to be fair, you did
stop a master criminal from
stealing two dozen... moldy onions.

NAME: Person_1
Hate to disagree with you, sir, but
those aren't onions. Those are a
crocus varietal called Midnicampum
Holicithias. They're a Class C
Botanical, sir. I grew up in a
family where plant husbandry was
kind of a thing.

NAME: Person_3
Shut your tiny mouth, now.

NAME: Person_1
Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my
job.

NAME: Person_3
Your job is putting tickets on
parked cars.

NAME: Person_3
Not now.

NAME: Person_3
Not now!

NAME: Person_1
Sir, I don't want to be a meter
maid... I wanna be a real cop.

NAME: Person_3
Do you think the Mayor asked what I
wanted when he assigned you to me?

NAME: Person_1
But sir, if you--

NAME: Person_3
Life isn't some cartoon musical
where you sing a little song and
your insipid dreams magically come
true. So let it go!

NAME: Side_6
Chief Bogo please-- five minutes of
your time. Please...

NAME: Person_7
I'm sorry, sir, I tried to stop
her, she is super slippery. I gotta
go sit down.

NAME: Person_3
Ma'am, as I've told you, we are
doing everything we can...

NAME: Side_6
My husband has been missing for ten
days. His name is Emmitt Otterton.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, I know.

NAME: Side_6
He's a florist. We have two
beautiful children. He would never
just disappear.

NAME: Person_3
Ma'am, our detectives are very
busy.

NAME: Side_6
Please. There's got to be somebody
to find my Em.

NAME: Person_3
Mrs. Otterton--

NAME: Side_6
Oh, thank you! Bless you, bless you
little bunny!
Take this. Find my Emmitt. Bring
him home to me and my babies.
Please?

NAME: Person_3
Mrs. Otterton? Please wait out
here.

NAME: Side_6
Of course. Oh, thank you both so
much.

NAME: Person_3
One second.

NAME: Person_3
You're fired.

NAME: Person_1
What? Why?!

NAME: Person_3
Insubordination. Now, I'm going to
open this door and you're going to
tell that otter you're a former
meter maid with delusions of
grandeur who will not be taking the
case.

NAME: Person_5
I just heard Officer Hopps is
taking the case!

NAME: Person_3
Assistant Mayor Bellwether...

NAME: Person_5
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative is
really starting to pay off! Mayor
Lionheart is just gonna be so
jazzed!

NAME: Person_3
No! No, let's not tell the mayor
just yet--

NAME: Person_5
And I sent it, and it is done, so I
did do that. All right, well I'd
say the case is in good hands! Us
little guys really need to stick
together! Right?

NAME: Person_1
Like glue!

NAME: Person_5
Good one! Just call me if you ever
need anything, okay? You've always
got a friend at City Hall, Judy.
Alright, bye bye!

NAME: Person_1
Thank you, ma'am.

NAME: Person_3
I will give you 48 hours.

NAME: Person_3
That's two days to find Emmitt
Otterton.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_3
But, you strike out-- you resign.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, uh... okay... deal.

NAME: Person_3
Splendid. Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

NAME: Person_7
Here ya go! One missing otter!

NAME: Person_1
That's it?!

NAME: Person_7
Yikes! That is the smallest case
file I've ever seen! Leads: none,
witnesses: none-- and you're not in
the computer system yet, so
resources: none.
I hope you didn't stake your career
on cracking this one.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.
"Last known sighting..."

NAME: Person_1
Can I just borrow--
Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
Pawpsicle.

NAME: Person_7
The murder weapon!

NAME: Person_1
Get your pawpsicle...

NAME: Person_7
Yeah, `cause that... What does that
mean?

NAME: Person_1
It means I... have a lead.

NAME: Person_1
Hi! Hello? It's me again!

NAME: Person_2
Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot.

NAME: Person_1
Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer
Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some
questions about a case.

NAME: Person_2
What happened, meter maid? Did
someone steal a traffic cone? It
wasn't me.

NAME: Person_2
Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the
baby, I gotta get to work.

NAME: Person_1
This is important, sir. I think
your ten dollars worth of popsicles
can wait.

NAME: Person_2
I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365
days a year, since I was 12, and
time is money, hop along.

NAME: Person_1
Please, just look at the picture.

NAME: Person_1
You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle
right? Do you know him?

NAME: Person_2
I know everybody. And I also know
that somewhere there's a toy store
missing its stuffed animal, so why
don't you get back to your box.

NAME: Person_1
Fine. Then we'll have to do this
the hard way.

NAME: Person_2
Did you just boot my stroller?

NAME: Person_1
Nicholas Wilde, you are under
arrest.

NAME: Person_2
For what? Howting your feewings?

NAME: Person_1
Felony tax evasion.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days
a year... since you were 12, that's
two decades, so times twenty...

NAME: Person_1
...which is one million four-
hundred sixty thousand-- I think, I
mean I am just a dumb bunny, but we
are good at multiplying-- anyway,
according to your tax forms...
...you reported let me see here:
zero. Unfortunately, lying on a
federal form is a punishable
offense. Five years jail time.

NAME: Person_2
Well, it's my word against yours.

NAME: Person_2 (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER)
"200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a
year, since I was 12."

NAME: Person_1
Actually, it's your word against
yours. And if you want this pen,
you're going to help me find this
poor missing otter or the only
place you'll be selling popsicles
is the prison cafeteria.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

NAME: FINPerson_2
She hustled you.
She hustled you good! You're a cop
now Nick, you're gonna need one of
these! Have fun working with the
fuzz!

NAME: Person_1
Start talking.

NAME: Person_2
I don't know where he is.
I only saw where he went.

NAME: Person_1
Great, let's go.

NAME: Person_2
It's not exactly a place for a cute
little bunny.

NAME: Person_1
Don't call me cute.
Get in the car.

NAME: Person_2
Okay. You're the boss.

NAME: Side_10
Oooooooooohmmmmmmmm.
Oooooooooooohmmmmmm.

NAME: Person_1
Hi, hello.

NAME: Person_1
Um, hello? Hello? HELLO?!

NAME: Person_1
Hello! My name is--

NAME: Side_10
Ooo, you know, I'm gonna hit the
pause button right there, `cause
we're all good on Bunny Scout
Cookies.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, no... I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.
I'm looking for a missing mammal,
Emmitt Otterton. Right here--
--who may have frequented this
establishment.

NAME: Side_50
Yeah, Ol' Emmitt! Haven't seen him
in a couple weeks. But hey, you
should talk to his yoga instructor,
I'd be happy to take you back.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, thank you so much, I'd
appreciate that more than you can
imagine. It would be such a big--
You are naked!

NAME: Side_10
Huh? Oh for sure, we're a
naturalist club.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, in Zootopia anyone can be
anything. These guys... they be
naked.

NAME: Side_10
Nangi's just on the other side of
the pleasure pool.

NAME: Person_2
Does this make you uncomfortable?
Because, if so, there's no shame in
calling it quits.

NAME: Person_1
Yes there is.

NAME: Person_2
Boy, that's the spirit.

NAME: Side_10
Yeah, some mammals say the
naturalist life is weird, but you
know what I say is weird? Clothes
on animals! Here we go.

NAME: Side_10
As you can see, Nangi's an
elephant, so she'll totally
remember everything. Hey Nangi,
these dudes have some questions
about Emmitt the Otter.

NAME: Side_13
Who?

NAME: Side_11
Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to
your yoga class for like 6 years?

NAME: Side_13
I have no memory of this beaver.

NAME: Side_5
He's an otter actually.

NAME: Side_11
He was here a couple Wednesdays
ago. `Member?

NAME: Side_13
Nope.

NAME: Side_11
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable-
knit sweater vest, and new pair of
corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley
tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real
tight. Remember that Nangi?

NAME: Side_13
No.

NAME: Side_11
Yeah, and we both walked him out
and he got into this big ol' white
car with a silver trim? Needed a
tune up. The third cylinder wasn't
firing. `Member that, Nangi?

NAME: Side_13
Nope.

NAME: Person_1
You didn't happen to catch the
license plate number, did you?

NAME: Side_11
Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03.

NAME: Person_1
0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great
info, thank you.

NAME: Side_11
Told ya Nangi has a mind like a
steel trap. I wish I had a memory
like an elephant.

NAME: Person_2
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome
for the clue. And seeing as how any
moron can run a plate, I will take
that pen and bid you adieu.

NAME: Person_1
The plate... I can't run a plate...
I'm not in the system yet.

NAME: Person_2
Give me the pen please.

NAME: Person_1
What was it you said? "Any moron
can run a plate?" Gosh... if only
there were a moron around who were
up to the task...

NAME: Person_2
Rabbit, I did what you asked, you
can't keep me on the hook forever.

NAME: Person_1
Not forever. Why, I only have 36
hours left to solve this case. So
can you run the plate or not?

NAME: Person_2
Actually, I just remembered I have
a pal at the DMV...

NAME: Person_2
Flash is the fastest guy in there,
you need something done, he's on
it.

NAME: Person_1
I hope so, we are really fighting
the clock and every minute counts.
Wait. They're all sloths?!

NAME: Person_1
You said this was going to be
quick!

NAME: Person_2
What? Are you saying that because
he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I
thought in Zootopia anyone could be
anything.

NAME: Person_2
Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash!
Buddy, it's nice to see ya.

NAME: Person_8
Nice to...
see you...
too.

NAME: Person_2
Hey Flash, I'd love ya to meet my
friend-- uh, darlin' I've forgotten
your name.

NAME: Person_1
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD.
How are ya?

NAME: Person_8
I am... doing... just...

NAME: Person_1
Fine?

NAME: Person_8
...as well... as... I can... be.
What...

NAME: Person_2
Hang in there.

NAME: Person_8
...can I... do...

NAME: Person_1
Well, I was hoping you could run a
plate--

NAME: Person_8
For you...

NAME: Person_1
Well, I was hoping you could--

NAME: Person_8
...today.

NAME: Person_1
Well, I was hoping you could run a
plate for us. We are in a really
big hurry.

NAME: Person_8
Sure.    What's the... plate...

NAME: Person_8
...Number?

NAME: Person_8
NAME: Person_1
Mmhmm. 0, 3.

NAME: Person_2
Hey Flash, wanna hear a joke?

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Person_8
Sure.

NAME: Person_2
What do you call a three humped
camel?

NAME: Person_8
I don't... know...
What... do... you call... a...

NAME: Person_1
Three humped camel.

NAME: Person_8
Three humped... camel?

NAME: Person_2
Pregnant.

NAME: Person_8
Ha... ha... ha... ha...

NAME: Person_1
Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny,
can we please just focus on the
task--

NAME: Person_8
Hey... Priscilla...

NAME: Person_1
Oh no!

NAME: Side_51
Yes... Flash?

NAME: Person_8
What... do...

NAME: Person_1
No!

NAME: Person_8
You call... a...

NAME: Person_1
A three humped camel? Pregnant!
Okay, great, we got it, please just-

NAME: Person_8
Three... humped...

NAME: Person_1
Aggggggghhhhhhh--

NAME: Person_8
Here...

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you!

NAME: Person_8
You... go.

NAME: Person_1
29THD03-- it's registered to...
Tundratown Limo Service? A limo
took Otterton, and the limo's in
Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown!

NAME: Person_2
Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I
owe ya.

NAME: Person_1
Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour
and--

NAME: Person_1
Closed. Great.

NAME: Person_2
Mm. And I will betcha you don't
have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn
it. It's a bummer.

NAME: Person_1
You wasted the day on purpose.

NAME: Person_2
Madam, I have a fake badge. I would
never impede your pretend
investigation.

NAME: Person_1
It's not a pretend investigation!
Look, see--
(showing picture of
Otterton)
See him? This otter is missing.

NAME: Person_2
Well then they should have gotten a
real cop to find him.

NAME: Person_1
What is your problem? Does seeing
me fail somehow make you feel
better about your own sad,
miserable life?

NAME: Person_2
It does. One hundred percent.
Now... since you're sans warrant, I
guess we're done?

NAME: Person_1
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

NAME: Person_2
Hey!

NAME: Person_2
First off, you throw like a bunny,
second, you're a very sore loser.
See ya later, Officer Fluff, so sad
this is over, I wish I could've
helped more.

NAME: Person_1
The thing is, you don't need a
warrant if you have probable cause,
and I'm pretty sure I saw a shifty
low-life climbing the fence, so
you're helping plenty. Come on.

NAME: Person_1
29THD03... this is it.

NAME: Person_1
Polar bear fur.

NAME: Person_2
NAME: Person_1
What? What?!

NAME: Person_2
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!
But on CD? Who still uses CDs?

NAME: Person_2
Carrots...? If your otter was
here... he had a very bad day.

NAME: Person_1
Those are... claw marks. You ever
seen anything like this?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, wait. Look.

NAME: Person_1
This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He
was definitely here. What do you
think happened?

NAME: Person_2
Well, now wait a minute...
Polar bear fur... Rat Pack music...
fancy cup...
I know whose car this is. We gotta
go!

NAME: Person_1
Why? Whose car is it?

NAME: Person_2
The most feared crime boss in
Tundratown. They call him Mr. Big
and he does not like me, so we
gotta go!

NAME: Person_1
I'm not leaving, this is a crime
scene.

NAME: Person_2
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger
crime scene if Mr. Big finds me
here, so we're leaving right now!

NAME: Person_2
Raymond! And, is that Kevin?! Long
time no see. And speaking of no
see, how about you forget you saw
me? Huh? For old time's sake?

NAME: Person_2
That's a no.

NAME: Person_1
What did you do that made Mr. Big
so mad at you?

NAME: Person_2
I uh, I may have sold him a very
expensive wool rug... that was made
from the fur of a... skunk's butt.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

NAME: Person_1
Is that Mr. Big?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_1
What about him? Is that him?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_1
That's gotta be him.

NAME: Person_2
Stop talking stop talking stop
talking--

NAME: Person_2
Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple
misunder-

NAME: Person_2
This is a simple misunderstanding.

NAME: Side_2
You come here unannounced... on the
day my daughter is to be married?

NAME: Person_2
Well actually we were brought here
against our will, so...
Point is, I did not know it was
your car, and I certainly did not
know about your daughter's wedding.

NAME: Side_2
I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed
you into my home... we broke bread
together... Gram-mama made you her
cannoli. And how did you repay my
generosity? With a rug... made from
the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt
rug. You disrespected me. You
disrespected my gram-mama who I
buried in that skunk butt rug. I
told you never to show your face
here again, but here you are,
snooping around with this...
What are you, a performer? What's
with the costume?

NAME: Person_1
Sir, I am a c--

NAME: Person_2
Mime! She is a mime. This mime,
cannot speak. You can't speak if
you're a mime.

NAME: Person_1
No. I am a cop. And I'm on the
Emmitt Otterton case, and my
evidence puts him in your car, so
intimidate me all you want, I'm
going to find out what you did to
that otter if it's the last thing I
do.

NAME: Side_2
Then I have only one request: say
hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em!

NAME: Person_2
Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm
not saying nothing--

NAME: Side_2
And you never will--

NAME: Person_2
Please! No no no! If you're mad at
me about the rug I've got more
rugs!

NAME: Side_8
Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance.
(sees them trying to kill
Nick)
What did we say? No icing anyone at
my wedding!

NAME: Side_2
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.
Ice `em.

NAME: Side_8
Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that
saved my life yesterday. From that
giant donut.

NAME: Side_2
This bunny?

NAME: Side_8
Yeah. Hi!

NAME: Person_1
Hi.
I love your dress.

NAME: Side_8
Aw, thank you.

NAME: Side_2
Put `em down.
You have done me a great service.
I will help you find the otter. I
will take your kindness... and pay
it forward.

NAME: Side_2
Otterton is my florist. He's like a
part of the family. He had
something important he wanted to
discuss. That's why I sent that car
to pick him up. But he never
arrived.

NAME: Person_1
Because he was attacked.

NAME: Side_2
No... he attacked.

NAME: Person_1
Otterton?

NAME: Side_2
Otterton. He went crazy. Ripped up
the car, scared my driver half to
death and disappeared into the
night.

NAME: Person_1
He's a sweet little otter.

NAME: Side_2
My child, we may be evolved... but
deep down we are still animals.

NAME: Person_1
Mr. Manchas? Judy Hopps, ZPD. We
just want to know what happened to
Emmitt Otterton.

NAME: Person_2
Whoa. A teensy otter... did that?

NAME: Person_1
What... happened?

NAME: Side_29
There was no warning, he just kept
yelling about the "night howlers."
Over and over, "the night
howlers..."

NAME: Person_2
Oh. So you know about the night
howlers too? Good, good, good.
Because the night howlers are
exactly what we are here to talk
about.
Right?

NAME: Person_1
Yep. So, uh, you just open the door
and tell us what you know and we
will tell you what we know. Okay?

NAME: Side_29
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Clever fox.

NAME: Person_1
Mr. Manchas?

NAME: Person_2
Buddy?

NAME: Person_1
Are you... okay?

NAME: Person_1
Run. RUN!

NAME: Person_2
What is wrong with him?!

NAME: Person_1
I don't know!!

NAME: Person_1
Jump!

NAME: Person_1
Head down!

NAME: Person_1
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

NAME: Person_7
Are you familiar with Gazelle?
Greatest singer of our lifetime--
angel with horns-- okay, hold on,
keep watching. Who's that beside
her? Who is it?

NAME: Person_7
It's me! Did you think it was real?
It looks so real! It's not. It's
just a new app.
(finally notices ringing
phone)
Hold on a second--

NAME: Person_7!
NAME: Person_1
Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a
10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and
Tu-junja!

NAME: Person_2
It's Tujunga!

NAME: Person_1
There! Head to the skytrams!

NAME: Person_2
Get in! Carrots? Carrots!

NAME: Person_1
Go!

NAME: Person_2
No, no, no!

NAME: Person_2
Buddy, one predator to another--                      *

NAME: Person_2
Now, I can tell you're a little
tense, so I'm just gonna give you a
little personal space--

NAME: Person_2
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let
go!

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna let go!

NAME: Person_2
No, you what? No, I said-- listen--
noooo!

NAME: Person_1
One, two--

NAME: Person_2
Carrots. You saved my life.

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_53
Well. That's what we do at the
Deeeeeeeeeeeee.....

NAME: Person_3
Well, this should be good.

NAME: Person_1
I thought this was just a missing
mammal case, but it's way bigger.

NAME: Person_1
Mr. Otterton did not just
disappear. I believe he and this
jaguar, they... went savage, Sir.

NAME: Person_3
Savage? This isn't the Stone Age,
Hopps. Animals don't go savage.

NAME: Person_1
I thought so too, `til I saw this:

NAME: Person_1
What? He was right here...

NAME: Person_3
The "savage" jaguar.

NAME: Person_1
Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost
killed us.

NAME: Person_3
Or maybe any aggressive predator
looks savage to you rabbits.
Let's go.

NAME: Person_1
Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one
who saw him!
Nick!

NAME: Person_3
You think I'm going to believe a
fox?

NAME: Person_1
Well he was a key witness and I
enlisted--

NAME: Person_3
Two days to find the otter...

NAME: Person_3
or you quit... that was the deal.
Badge.

NAME: Person_1
But, Sir, we...

NAME: Person_3
Badge.

NAME: Person_3
What did you say, fox?

NAME: Person_2
Sorry, what I said was, "no." She
will not be giving you that badge.
Look, you gave her a clown vest and
a three-wheel joke-mobile and two
days to solve a case you guys
haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah,
no wonder she needed to get help
from a fox, none of you guys were
gonna help her, were you?

NAME: Person_2
Here's the thing Chief, you gave
her the 48 hours, so technically we
still have 10 left to find our Mr.
Otterton... and that's exactly what
we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse
us... we have a very big lead to
follow and a case to crack. Good
day.

NAME: Person_2
Officer Hopps?

NAME: Person_1
Thank you.

NAME: Person_2
Never let `em see that they get to
you.

NAME: Person_1
So, things do get to you...

NAME: Person_2
No... I mean, not anymore. But I
was small and emotionally
unbalanced like you once.

NAME: Person_1
Har-har.

NAME: Person_2
(retreating into the
memory)
No, it's true. I think was 8, or
maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was
join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

NAME: Side_17
Ready for initiation?

NAME: YOUNG Person_2
Yeah! Pretty much born ready.

NAME: Side_17
Okay. Now raise your right hand and
deliver the oath.

NAME: YOUNG Person_2
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be
brave, loyal, helpful, and
trustworthy.

NAME: Side_17
Even though you're a fox?

NAME: YOUNG Person_2
What?

NAME: YOUNG Person_2
No! What did I do wrong, you guys?!
No! Please tell me, what did I do
wrong?!

NAME: YOUNG Person_2
What did I do?!

NAME: Side_17
If you thought we would ever trust
a fox without a muzzle, you're even
dumber than you look.

NAME: Side_17 (O.S.)
Aw, is he gonna cry?

NAME: Person_2
I learned two things that day. One,
I was never gonna let anyone see
that they got to me.

NAME: Person_1
...And two?

NAME: Person_2
If the world's only gonna see a fox
as shifty and untrustworthy,
there's no point in trying to be
anything else.

NAME: Person_1
Nick, you are so much more than
that...

NAME: Person_2
Boy, look at that traffic down
there.
How about we go out to Chuck in
Traffic Central-- Chuck, how are
things looking on the Jam Cams?

NAME: Person_1
Nick, I'm glad you told me...

NAME: Person_2
The Jam Cams...!

NAME: Person_1
Seriously, it's okay...

NAME: Person_2
No-n-shh-shush! There are traffic
cameras everywhere. All over the
canopy. Whatever happened to that
jaguar--

NAME: Person_1
The traffic cams would have caught
it!

NAME: Person_2
Bingo!

NAME: Person_1
Pretty sneaky, Slick.

NAME: Person_2
However. If you didn't have access
to the system before, I doubt Chief
Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into
it now.

NAME: Person_1
No... But I have a friend at City
Hall who might.

NAME: Person_5
Sir? If we could just review these
very important--
Sir?

NAME: Person_5
Ooo, I'm so sorry... sir?!

NAME: Side_1
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether. Just
take care of it!
(setting another binder
atop her stack)
Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm
going out.

NAME: Person_5
No, no! But, sir, you do have a
meeting with Herds and Grazing...
sir, if I could just--

NAME: Person_5
Oh, mutton chops.

NAME: Person_1
Assistant Mayor Bellwether? We need
your help.

NAME: Person_1
We just need to get into the
traffic cam database.

NAME: Person_2
So fluffy!

NAME: Person_1
Hey!

NAME: Person_2
Sheep never let me this close.

NAME: Person_1
You can't just touch a sheep's
wool...

NAME: Person_2                          Person_1
It's like cotton candy.            Stop it!

NAME: Person_5
Where to?

NAME: Person_1
Rainforest District, Vine and
Tujunga.

NAME: Person_5
There! Traffic cams for the whole
city. This is so exciting,
actually. Well, you know, I never
get to do anything this important.

NAME: Person_1
But you're the Assistant Mayor of
Zootopia.

NAME: Person_5
Oh, I'm more of a glorified
secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote...
But he did give me that nice mug.

NAME: Person_5
Feels good to be appreciated.

NAME: Person_5
That's a fun little name he likes
to use. I called him Lionfart once.
He did not care for that, let me
tell you. It was not a good day for
me.
Yes, sir?

NAME: Person_5
Oh, dear. I better go --
Let me know what you find. It was
really nice for me to be--

NAME: Person_2
You think when she goes to sleep
she counts herself?

NAME: Person_1
Shush. Okay, traffic cams...
Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in.

NAME: Person_1
Who are these guys?

NAME: Person_2
Timberwolves. Look at these
dumdums.

NAME: Person_2
Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna
howl.

NAME: Person_2
And there it is. What is it with
wolves and the howling? It's like--

NAME: Person_1
Howlers! Night howlers! That's what
Manchas was afraid of... wolves!
The wolves are the night howlers.
If they took Manchas...

NAME: Person_2
...I bet they took Otterton too.

NAME: Person_1
All we gotta do is find out where
they went.

NAME: Person_1
Wait. Where'd they go?

NAME: Person_2
You know, if I wanted to avoid
surveillance because I was doing
something illegal-- which I never
have-- I would use the maintenance
tunnel 6B... which would put them
out...

NAME: Person_2
...right there.

NAME: Person_1
Well, look at you, Junior
Detective. You know, I think you'd
actually make a pretty good cop.

NAME: Person_2
How dare you.

NAME: Person_2
Acacia alley... Ficus underpass...
South Canyon...

NAME: Person_1
They're heading out of town...
Where does that road go?

NAME: Side_30
Gary, quit it, you're gonna start a
howl.

NAME: GARY THE Side_30
I didn't start it.
Oooooooo!

NAME: Side_30
Oooooooooo!

NAME: Person_1
Come on!

NAME: Person_2
You are a clever bunny.

NAME: Person_1
It looks like this was a hospital.

NAME: Person_2
You know, after you, you're the
cop.

NAME: Person_2
Okay. All clear.

NAME: Person_1
All this equipment is brand new...

NAME: Person_1
Claw marks...

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. Huge, huge, claw marks. I
mean, what kind of--

NAME: Person_1
Mr. Manchas.

NAME: Person_1
It's him. We found our otter.
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer
Judy Hopps. Your wife sent me to
find you. We're gonna get you out
of here now.

NAME: Person_2
Or not. Guess he's in no rush to
get home to the Missus.

NAME: Person_1
...11, 12, 13, 14. Not including
Manchas it's 14...
Chief Bogo handed out 14 Missing
Mammal files... They're all here.
All the missing mammals are right
here.

NAME: Side_15
Mayor Lionheart, please, we're
doing everything we can.

NAME: Side_1
Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a
half animals here who've gone off
the rails crazy-- and you can't
tell me why. Now, I'd call that
awfully far from doing everything.

NAME: Side_15
Sir, it may be time to consider
their biology.

NAME: Side_1
What? What do you mean biology?

NAME: Side_15
The only animals going savage are
predators. We cannot keep it a
secret. We need to come forward.

NAME: Side_1
Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public.
And how do you think they're gonna
feel about their mayor, who is a
lion?! I'll be ruined!

NAME: Side_15
Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

NAME: Side_1
Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are
going to keep it that way.

NAME: Side_1
Someone's here!

NAME: Side_15
Sir, you need to go, now!
Security! Sweep the area!

NAME: Person_2
Great! We're dead. We're dead.
That's it. I'm dead. You're dead.
Everybody's dead.

NAME: Person_1
Can you swim?

NAME: Person_2
What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim.
Why?

NAME: Person_2
Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?!

NAME: Person_1
We gotta tell Bogo!

NAME: Person_7
Chief Bogo!

NAME: Person_3
Not now!

NAME: Person_7
Wait, is that Gazelle?

NAME: Person_3
(struggling to silence his
phone)
No!

NAME: Person_7
You have the app too?!
Oh, jeeeeez!

NAME: Person_3
Clawhauser, can't you see I'm
working on the missing mammal
cases?!

NAME: Person_7
Oh, yes of course! About that,
sir... Officer Hopps just called...
She found all of `em.

NAME: Person_1
Mayor Lionheart, you have the right
to remain silent. Anything--

NAME: Side_1
You don't understand. I was trying
to protect the city.

NAME: Person_1
You were just trying to protect
your job.

NAME: Side_1
No. Listen, we still don't know why
this is happening. It could destroy
Zootopia.

NAME: Person_1
You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say can and
will be used against you in a court
of law...

NAME: Person_3
Ladies and Gentlemammals... 14
mammals went missing and all 14
have been found by our newest
recruit, who will speak to you in a
moment. But first, let me remind
you--

NAME: Person_1
Rrrgh. I am so nervous...

NAME: Person_2
Okay, press conference 101: You
wanna look smart?

NAME: Person_2
Answer their question with your own
question and then answer that
question. Like this, "Excuse me.
Officer Hopps, what can you tell us
about the case?"
"Well, was this a tough case? Yes.
Yes it was." You see?

NAME: Person_1
You should be there with me. We did
this together.

NAME: Person_2
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

NAME: Person_1
Funny you should say that, because
I've been thinking... it would be
nice to have a partner.

NAME: Person_1
Here. In case you need something to
write with.

NAME: Person_5
Officer Hopps, it's time.

NAME: Person_3
So now, I'll turn things over to
the officer who cracked the case.
Officer Judy Hopps.

NAME: Side_31
Officer Hopps! / Over here! / Here!

NAME: Person_1
Yes?

NAME: Side_57
What can you tell us about the
animals that went savage?

NAME: Person_1
Well, the animals in question...
Are they all different species?
Yes. Yes they are.

NAME: Side_57 2
Okay, so what is the connection?

NAME: Person_1
Well, all we know is that they are
all members of the predator family.

NAME: ANOTHER Side_57
So, predators are the only ones
going savage?

NAME: Person_1
That is accu-- Yes, that is
accurate. Yes...

NAME: Side_57 3
Wow. Why is that happening?

NAME: Person_1
We still don't know--

NAME: Person_1
Ah, it may have something to do
with biology.

NAME: Person_1
A biological component. You know,
something in their DNA...

NAME: Side_57 4
In their DNA? Can you elaborate on
that, please?

NAME: Person_1
Yes. What I mean is, thousands of
years ago... um... predators
survived through their aggressive
hunting instincts. For whatever
reason, they seem to be reverting
back to their primitive, savage
ways.

NAME: Person_1
It is possible. So we must be
vigilant. And we at the ZPD are
prepared and are here to protect
you...

NAME: Side_31
Will more mammals go savage? / What
is being done to protect us? / Have
you considered a mandatory
quarantine on predators?

NAME: Person_5
Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh,
that's all the time that we have.
No more questions...

NAME: Person_1
Was I okay?

NAME: Person_5
Oh, you did fine.

NAME: Person_1
That went so fast! I didn't get a
chance to mention you or say
anything about how we--

NAME: Person_2
Oh, I think you said plenty.

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean?

NAME: Person_2
Clearly, there's a biological
component? These predators may be
reverting back to their primitive,
savage ways. Are you serious?

NAME: Person_1
I just stated the facts of the
case. I mean, it's not like a bunny
could go savage...

NAME: Person_2
Right. But a fox could? Huh?

NAME: Person_1
Nick, stop it. You're not like
them.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, there's a them now?

NAME: Person_1
You know what I mean. You're not
that kind of predator.

NAME: Person_2
The kind that needs to be muzzled?
The kind that makes you think you
need to carry around Fox Repellent?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice
that little item the first time we
met.
So let me ask you a question. Are
you afraid of me?
Do you think I might go nuts? Do
you think I might go savage? Do you
think I might try to... EAT YOU?!

NAME: Person_2
...I knew it. Just when I thought
somebody actually believed in me...

NAME: Person_2
Probably best if you don't have a
predator as a partner.

NAME: Person_1
No. Nick. Nick!

NAME: Side_57 5
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

NAME: Person_1
No. He's my friend.

NAME: Side_57 6
We can't even trust our own
friends?

NAME: Person_1
That is not what I said! Please!

NAME: Side_57S
Are we safe? / Have any other foxes
gone savage?

NAME: Side_32
More bad news in this city gripped
by fear.

NAME: Side_32
A caribou is in critical condition,
the victim of a mauling by a savage
polar bear. This-- the 27th such
attack-- comes just one week after
ZPD Officer Judy Hopps connected
the violence to traditionally
predatory animals.

NAME: MALE Side_46 NEWS ANCHOR
Meanwhile, a peace rally organized
by pop star, Gazelle, was marred by
protest.

NAME: Side_66
Go back to the forest, predator!

NAME: Side_26
I'm from the savannah!

NAME: Side_18
Zootopia is a unique place. It's a
crazy, beautiful, diverse city
where we celebrate our differences.
(gestures to PROTESTERS in
background)
This is not the Zootopia I know.

NAME: Side_6
That's not my Emmitt.

NAME: Side_18
We cannot let fear divide us.
Please-- give me back the Zootopia
I love...

NAME: Person_3
Come on Hopps. The new Mayor wants
to see us.

NAME: Person_1
The Mayor? Why?

NAME: Person_3
It would seem you've arrived.

NAME: Person_1
Clawhauser? What're you doing?

NAME: Person_7
Um, they thought it would be better
if a predator such as myself wasn't
the first face you that you see
when you walk into the ZPD.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_7
They're gonna move me to Records.
It's downstairs. By the boiler.

NAME: Person_3
Hopps!

NAME: Person_1
Um... I don't understand.

NAME: Person_5
Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And
right now they're just really
scared. You're a hero to them. They
trust you. And so that's why Chief
Bogo and I want you to be the
public face of the ZPD.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came
here to make the world a better
place, but I think I broke it.

NAME: Person_3
Don't give yourself so much credit,
Hopps. The world has always been
broken. That's why we need good
cops-- like you.

NAME: Person_1
With all due respect, sir, a good
cop is supposed to serve and
protect-- help the city. Not tear
it apart.
I don't deserve this badge.

NAME: Person_3
Hopps.

NAME: Person_5
Judy, you've worked so hard to get
here. It's what you've wanted since
you were a kid. You can't quit...

NAME: Person_1
Thank you for the opportunity.

NAME: Person_1
A dozen carrots.

NAME: Side_33
Thanks!

NAME: Person_1
Have a nice day.

NAME: Side_33
Come on.

NAME: STU Person_1
Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude,
remember that one? How we doin?

NAME: Person_1.
I'm fine.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
You are not fine. Your ears are
droopy.

NAME: Person_1
Why did I think I could make a
difference?

NAME: STU Person_1
Because you're a trier, that's why.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
You've always been a trier.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, I tried. And it made life so
much worse for so many innocent
predators.

NAME: STU Person_1
Oh, not all of them, though. Speak
of the devil. Right on time.

NAME: Person_1
Is that... Gideon Grey?

NAME: STU Person_1
Yep. It sure is. We work with him
now.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
He's our partner. And we never
would have considered it had you
not opened our minds.

NAME: STU Person_1
That's right. I mean, Gid's turned
into one of the top pastry chefs in
the tri-burrows.

NAME: Person_1
That's really cool, you guys.

NAME: Person_1
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

NAME: ADULT Side_3
Hey Judy-- I'd like to say I'm
sorry for the way I behaved in my
youth. I had a lotta self-doubt
that manifested itself in the form
of unchecked rage and aggression. I
was a major jerk.

NAME: Person_1
Well, I know a thing or two about
being a jerk...

NAME: ADULT Side_3
Anyhow-- I brought you all these
pies.

NAME: STU Person_1
Hey kids! Don't you run through
that midnicampum holicithias!

NAME: Side_68
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

NAME: ADULT Side_3
Now there's a 4-dollar word, Mr. H.
My family always just called them
night howlers.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, what did you say?

NAME: STU Person_1
Oh, Gid's talking about those
flowers, Judy. I use `em to keep
bugs off the produce. But I don't
like the little ones going near `em
on account of what happened to your
Uncle Terry.

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we
were kids and went completely nuts.

NAME: STU Person_1
He bit the dickens out of your
mother.

NAME: Person_1
A bunny can go savage...

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.
But it did hurt like the devil.

NAME: STU Person_1
Well sure it did. There's a sizable
divot in your arm. I'd call that
savage.

NAME: Person_1
Night howlers aren't wolves.
They're flowers. The flowers are
making the predators go savage.
That's it! That's what I've been
missing!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry!
Come on! Thank you, I love you bye!

NAME: STU Person_1
You catch any of that, Bon?

NAME: BONNIE Person_1
Not one bit.

NAME: Side_3
Well, that makes me feel a little
better. I thought she was talking
in tongues or something.

NAME: FINPerson_2
Who is it?

NAME: Person_1
I need to find Nick. Please.

NAME: Person_1
Nick? Nick!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, Nick! Night howlers aren't
wolves. They're toxic flowers. I
think someone is targeting
predators on purpose and making
them go savage.

NAME: Person_2
Wow. Isn't that interesting.

NAME: Person_1
Wait! Wait, please-- I know you'll
never forgive me. And I don't blame
you. I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant and irresponsible
and small-minded... But predators
shouldn't suffer because of my
mistakes. I have to fix this, but I
can't do it without you.

NAME: Person_1
And after we're done, you can hate
me, and that'll be fine, because I
was a horrible friend and I hurt
you... and you can walk away
knowing you were right all along, I
really am just a dumb bunny.

NAME: Person_1 (ON RECORDER)
I really am just a dumb bunny. I
really am just a dumb bunny.

NAME: Person_2
Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you
erase it... in 48 hours.

NAME: Person_2
Alright, get in here.

NAME: Person_2
Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so
emotional. There we go. Deep
breath.
Are you just trying to steal the
pen. Is that what this is?
You are standing on my tail,
though. Off, off, off.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_2
I thought you guys only grew
carrots.
What's the plan?

NAME: Person_1
We are gonna follow the night
howlers.

NAME: Person_2
Okay. How?

NAME: Person_1
Know this guy?

NAME: Person_2
Uh-huh. I told you, I know
everybody.

NAME: Side_4
Well, hello, step right up!
Anything you need... I got it. All
your favorite movies! I got movies
that haven't even been released
yet!

NAME: Side_4
Hey, 15% off! 20! Make me an offer!
Come on!

NAME: Person_2
Well, well, look who it is. The
duke of bootleg.

NAME: Side_4
What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't
you be melting down a popsicle or
something?
Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.

NAME: Person_1
We both know those weren't moldy
onions I caught you stealing. What
were you gonna do with those night
howlers, Wessleton?

NAME: Side_4
It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And
I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't
nothing you can do to make me.

NAME: Side_2
Ice `em.

NAME: Side_4
Aaagh! Agh!
Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?!
She's a cop!

NAME: Side_2
And the godmother to my future
granddaughter.

NAME: Side_8
I'm gonna name her Judy.

NAME: Person_1
Aw.

NAME: Side_2
Ice this weasel.

NAME: Side_4
All right, all right, please! I'll
talk! I'll talk. I stole them night
howlers so I could sell `em. They
offered me what I couldn't
refuse... Money.

NAME: Person_1
And to whom did you sell them?

NAME: Person_1
Come on!

NAME: Person_1
The weasel wasn't lying.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, looks like old Doug's
cornered the market on night
howlers...

NAME: Side_12
You got Doug here. What's the mark?
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

NAME: Side_12
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.
I can hit him. Listen, I hit a tiny
little otter through the open
window of a moving car.

NAME: Side_12
Yeah I'll buzz you when it's done.
Or you'll see it on the news. Ya
know, whichever comes first.

NAME: Side_12
Alright, Woolter and Jesse are
back, so I'm leaving now.
Out.

NAME: Person_2
Hey. Hey! Where are you going? Get
back here! What are you doing?!
He's gonna see you! What are you
looking at? Hey! Whatever you're
thinking, stop thinking it.
Carrots! Carrots!

NAME: Side_12
It better have the extra foam this
time--

NAME: Person_2
What are you doing?! You just
trapped us in here!

NAME: Person_1
We need to get this evidence to the

NAME: Person_2
Okay. Great. Here it is. Got it.

NAME: Person_1
No. All of it!

NAME: Person_2
Wait, what?

NAME: Person_2
Great, you're a conductor now? Hey,
listen-- It would take a miracle to
get this rust-bucket going.

NAME: Person_2
Well... Hallelujah!

NAME: Side_12
We kinda got a situation at the
lab...
Oh! It just got worse!

NAME: Person_2
Mission accomplished. Would it be
premature for me to do a little
victory toot-toot?

NAME: Person_1
All right. One toot-toot.

NAME: Person_2
Well, I can cross that off the
bucket list.

NAME: Person_2
I may have to rescind that victory
toot-toot.

NAME: Person_2
Maybe that's just hail?

NAME: Person_2
Back off!

NAME: Person_2
Incoming!

NAME: Person_2
Carrots?!

NAME: Person_1
Don't stop! Keep going!

NAME: Side_70
No! No! Please stop!

NAME: Person_1
Do not stop this car!

NAME: Person_1
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

NAME: Person_2
There's another train coming!

NAME: Person_1
Trust me! SPEED! UP!

NAME: Side_71
Stop the train! Hey!

NAME: Person_1
Hey. Need some help?

NAME: Person_2
Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast!
Hold on!

NAME: Person_2
I think this is our stop!

NAME: Person_1
Okay... Maybe some of the evidence
survived.

NAME: Person_1
Everything is gone. We've lost it
all.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. Oh, except for this.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, Nick! Yes!

NAME: Person_2
Ow.

NAME: Person_1
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.
Cut through the Natural History
Museum!

NAME: Person_1
Oh! There it is!

NAME: Person_1
Mayor Bellwether!
We found out what's happening.
Someone's darting predators with a
serum-- that's what's making them
go savage.

NAME: Person_5
I am so proud of you, Judy. You did
just a super job.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you, ma'am.
How did you know where to find us?

NAME: Person_5
I'll go ahead and I'll take that
case now.

NAME: Person_1
You know what... I think Nick and I
will just take this to the ZPD...

NAME: Person_1                           Person_2
Run!                            Run!

NAME: Person_5
Get them!

NAME: Person_1
Ach!

NAME: Person_2
Ah Carrots!

NAME: Person_2
I got ya, come here, come here.

NAME: Person_2
Okay, now just relax.

NAME: Person_2
Whoops... Blueberry?

NAME: Person_1
Pass.

NAME: Person_1
Take the case. Get it to Bogo.

NAME: Person_2
I'm not gonna leave you behind.
That's not happening.

NAME: Person_1
I can't walk.

NAME: Person_2
Just, we'll think of something.

NAME: Person_5
We're on the same team, Judy!

NAME: Person_5
Underestimated. Under-appreciated.
Aren't you sick of it? Predators.
They may be strong and loud, but
prey out-number predators 10 to
one.

NAME: Person_5
Think of it-- 90 percent of the
population, united against a common
enemy. We'll be unstoppable.

NAME: Person_5
Over there!

NAME: Person_5
Well, you should have stayed on the
carrot farm, huh? It really is too
bad; I really did like you.

NAME: Person_1
What are you going to do? Kill me?

NAME: Person_5
No! Of course not... he is.

NAME: Person_1
No! Nick?!

NAME: Person_5
Yes, police! There's a savage fox
in the natural history museum.
Officer Hopps is down! Please
hurry!

NAME: Person_1
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

NAME: Person_5
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?
Since preds are just biologically
predisposed to be savages.

NAME: Person_5
Gosh, think of the headline: "Hero
Cop Killed By Savage Fox..."

NAME: Person_1
So that's it, prey fears predator,
and you stay in power?

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, pretty much.

NAME: Person_1
It won't work.

NAME: Person_5
Fear always works. And I'll dart
every predator in Zootopia to keep
it that way.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, Nick! No!

NAME: Person_5
Bye-Bye, Bunny.

NAME: Person_1
Blood, blood, blood! And death.

NAME: Person_2
All right, you're milking it.
Besides, I think we got it, I think
we got it. We got it up there,
thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it
all out beautifully.

NAME: Person_5
What?

NAME: Person_2
Yea, oh, are you looking for the
serum?
Well, it's right here.

NAME: Person_1
What you've got in the weapon there-
- those are blueberries. From my
family's farm.

NAME: Person_2
They are delicious.
You should try some.

NAME: Person_5
I framed Lionheart, I can frame you
too! It's my word against yours!

NAME: Person_1
Oooo, actually--

NAME: Person_1
--It's your word against yours.
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.
Boom.

NAME: Side_73
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,
denies any knowledge of her plot,
claiming he was just trying to
protect the city.

NAME: Side_1
Did I falsely imprison those
animals? Well, yes. Yes I did. It
was a classic "doing the wrong
thing for the right reason" kind of
a deal.

NAME: Side_74
In related news, doctors say the
night howler antidote is proving
effective in rehabilitating the
afflicted predators...

NAME: Side_6
Emmitt? Oh... Emmitt...

NAME: Side_6
Thank you.

NAME: Person_1
So, no matter what type of animal
you are, from the biggest elephant
to our first fox...

NAME: Person_1
I implore you... try. Try to make
the world a better place.

NAME: Person_1
Look inside yourself, and recognize
that change starts with you. It
starts with me. It starts with all
of us.

NAME: Person_3
...Enough! Shut it! We have some
new recruits with us this morning,
including our first fox. Who cares.

NAME: Person_2
Ha! You should have your own line
of inspirational greeting cards,
sir.

NAME: Person_3
Shut your mouth, Wilde.
Assignments! Officers Grizzoli,
Fangmeyer, Delgato: Tundratown
Swat. Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard:
Undercover. Hopps, Wilde...
Parking duty. Dismissed.
Just kidding! We have reports of a
street racer tearing up Savannah
Central. Find him, shut him down.

NAME: Person_2
So are all rabbits bad drivers or
is it just you?

NAME: Person_1
Oops. Sorry.

NAME: Person_2
Sly bunny.

NAME: Person_1
Dumb fox.

NAME: Person_2
You know you love me.

NAME: Person_1
Do I know that? Yes. Yes, I do.

NAME: Person_1
Sir, you were going 115 miles per
hour. I hope you have a good
explanation.

NAME: Person_2
Flash? Flash? Hundred yard dash?!

NAME: Person_8
Nick.

NAME: Side_23
Cooool.

NAME: Person_1
Evening, Constable!

NAME: Side_4
Hi, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Are you familiar with the
expression `I can explain
everything'?

NAME: Side_4
Out of the car, please.

NAME: Person_1
Terribly sorry, but in the film
they used a different model to show
the old Batchap getting in and out.
This one has no doors, so I'd have
to squeeze out the back arsehole
first. Which nobody wants...
Apart from you, cheeky monkey!
It's a joke! Okay, okay.

NAME: Side_4
Okay, explain everything.

NAME: Person_1
Well. What with having spunked 1.6
million fat Alberts on this little
runaround, I thought why not take
it a step further and try to
actually collar a few ne-er do
wells? It worked for the
billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
Templemead? Will I have to do
traffic school?

NAME: Side_24
How much have you drunk, Arthur?

NAME: Person_1
To use the technical medical term -
megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
have a designated driver.

NAME: Side_6
Where's my five thousand dollars?

NAME: Person_1
The Boy Homeless here neglected to
say he'd never driven.

NAME: Person_1
Or that the only reason he's sober
is to be ready for the conspiracy
of leopards about to seize
Manhattan.

NAME: Side_6
It's LIZARDS! English prick!

NAME: Person_1
I trust this will cover all repairs
to New York and any inconvenience
to your good selves?

NAME: Person_1
Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
other chap.

NAME: Side_2
Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!

NAME: Person_1
Goodness. Why?

NAME: Side_2
Said I cut the bombita with pig
killer!

NAME: Person_1
Rude man. And who threw hot
Americano in whose face again?

NAME: Side_2
I did in his. No half and half
neither. That shit burnt!

NAME: Side_12
I burnt my sister's hair.

NAME: Side_2
Cool...

NAME: Side_12
Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause
I don't fit her definition of
hygiene. Plenty of places to take a
shit, toilet's just one of them.
Just ask the a-rabs.

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Side_25
It's like a chat show, this.
(looking into an imaginary
It's been said of my next guest, by
Jay the bandaged lunatic, that
she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out,
whacked-up asswipe'.
Carmella, when did you first dream
of becoming a crack whore?

NAME: Side_13
Mother died when I was six.

NAME: Person_1
Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.

NAME: Side_13
My father raped me when I was
twelve.

NAME: Person_1
Sounds like you had six relatively
good years.

NAME: Side_2
What do you do?

NAME: Person_1
I model riding boots, I spend
money, I sleep with women. But I
have weekends off and I am my own
boss.

NAME: Side_4
Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G-
d-lawyer's here.

NAME: Side_26
I don't think your mother will be
pleased, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Really, Elverton - if a chap can't
help out a few chums, whatever
their station in life.

NAME: Person_1
Each has given his or her word to
put the criminal life behind them.

NAME: Person_1
I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep
easy tonight.

NAME: Side_2
Don't point that shit at me, bitch!
I will FUCK YOU UP!

NAME: Side_6
Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!

NAME: Side_27
Arthur! What will your mother say?
Didn't she send you here to get you
out of the British papers? Arthur!

NAME: Person_1
Anyone need a job? My last driver
resigned after I filled his limo
with squirrels. Preferably sober,
clean driving licence?

NAME: Person_1
Stand back!

NAME: Person_1
The what?

NAME: Person_1
Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix
this thing right now.
How much, sir?

NAME: Side_28
Um. $800 please.

NAME: Person_1
Coming right up.
Fries with that?

NAME: Person_1
Congratulations everyone! THE

NAME: Person_1
Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can
you squeeze me in for a little
snack? Yeah, just me and a couple
of mates.

NAME: Person_1
Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie
gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a
motherlode of chips and your entire
wine cellar please.

NAME: Person_8
Arthur?

NAME: Person_8
Who are the women with you, Arthur?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe
she works for Avis. Checks the cars
for dings, dead people in the
trunk, that sort of thing. And
this is Carmella. Anyway...

NAME: Person_8'S FATHER
What do you do, Carmella?

NAME: Side_29
Whatever you want. But no
penetration without a rubber.

NAME: Person_1
Carmella's joking. She's actually
a...queen. Of a very small country.

NAME: Person_8'S FATHER
Is she now?

NAME: Person_1
It's terribly small.

NAME: Person_8'S FATHER
I see.

NAME: Person_1
Rhode Island could beat the crap
out of it in a war.

NAME: Person_8'S FATHER
Yes, it's a small place.

NAME: Person_1
85 cents in a cab from one end of
the country to the other. I'm
talking small.

NAME: Person_8'S FATHER
I think I understand how small it
is.

NAME: Person_1
Just had the entire country
carpeted, this is not a big place.

NAME: Person_8'S FATHER
You need to grow up, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
That's easy for you to say, you
haven't got 50 pairs of short
trousers hanging in your closet.
Maybe we should go somewhere else.

NAME: Person_8
Maybe you should.

NAME: Person_1
Could I have all those lobsters to
go, please?

NAME: Person_1
Cup of tea? Nice hot cup of hot
Rosy Lee right up your fanny?

NAME: Person_1
Hugh Grant Mr Bean self deprecation

NAME: Person_1
Morning, Hobson!

NAME: Person_3
Morning, Arthur.

NAME: Person_3
I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus
package failed to reignite the
economy.
De Cache Cocktail Lounge: $23,897?

NAME: Person_1
Umm...Celebration of Kwanzaa.

NAME: Person_3
The African heritage festival
celebrated five months from now?

NAME: Person_1
(noticing Sofia's stopped
having sex with him)
Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry.
How impolite of me. Sofia, this is
Hobson, my nanny.

NAME: Side_7
Nanny?

NAME: Person_3
He's merely shaped like an adult.

NAME: Side_7
Is she going to stay here?

NAME: Person_1
Hobson, could you come back in a
minute and a half please?

NAME: Person_3
Negative. You're seeing your mother
this morning.

NAME: Person_1
Nobody told me.

NAME: Person_3
Actually I did, on the other side
of the vast moat of champagne known
as `last night'.

NAME: Person_3
I wouldn't recommend letting him
get used to your breasts, dear.
Addictive personality. He was at
mine until he was six.

NAME: Person_1
Hobson! Really...

NAME: Person_3
I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the
nipples to see him off...

NAME: Side_7
I can't do this.

NAME: Person_3
I support your decision 100%. Will
you be requiring a taxi, or just be
getting in a random passing car?

NAME: Person_3
Say goodbye to your new friends,
Arthur. They have to go back to the
recession now.

NAME: Person_1
Cancel my mother please, Hobson.
I'll work from bed today.

NAME: Person_1
Not the death metal, please!

NAME: Person_3
Aren't you a fan of Carcass?

NAME: Person_3
`Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a
classic of its genre.

NAME: Person_3
Good boy.

NAME: Person_1
I'm going for a shower.

NAME: Person_3
I'll alert the media.

NAME: Person_3
They brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her
name...Hobson!

NAME: Person_1
Female Tom Hanks!

NAME: Person_3
She's early today...

NAME: Person_1
Can we invite her up and dress her
as Forrest Gump?

NAME: Person_3
No.

NAME: Person_1
Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.

NAME: Person_3
Do your armpits.

NAME: Person_3
Mr. Miller? My employer
inexplicably agreed to purchase
your...
`Authentic 1981 `Funshine' Care
Bear'? For $11,000 plus shipping
costs? Sorry, but that transaction
will take place over my dead body,
and I'm feeling rather well today.

NAME: Person_1
Father Wolverine...

NAME: Person_1
Wank Williams...That man has the
constitution of an ox.

NAME: Person_3
That reminds me, clean your
genitals. Heaven knows what
wildlife that girl was harbouring
between her thighs.

NAME: Person_1
I give you `Sideways farting
spider'.

NAME: Person_3
Arthur, you have to stop giving
money away!

NAME: Person_1
I'm a philanthropist.

NAME: Person_3
With the emphasis on the `pissed'.
Really, what is it about unearned
wealth that brings out such idiocy
in those who have it and those who
want it? The way you're going,
you'll have spent your inheritance
before you've inherited it.

NAME: Person_1
`Eagle pointing at lesbian.'

NAME: Person_3
Why did you fire Jessica?

NAME: Person_1
What kind of yoga teacher won't let
a pupil invent positions? She was
a Nazi with a pan pipe C.D.
`Upwards Pooping Astronaut'.

NAME: Person_3
Interesting. It looks more like
`Rich twit hiding from mother.' May
I remind you, she finances your
preposterous existence...

NAME: Person_1
I know, I know. Never bite the hand
that fists me.

NAME: Person_9
Sorry, fellas.

NAME: Person_1
Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He
got laid off in Chicago...

NAME: Person_3
But he doesn't know his way around
New York!

NAME: Person_1
So? I want interesting, fun people
around me, not drones who just get
the job done...

NAME: Person_1
Marty! Stop the car!

NAME: Person_2
...and inspired by the machine age
of the 1920s, this magnificent
structure was the world's tallest
building for 11 months before the
Empire State stole its thunder.

NAME: Person_2
The Chrysler got its name when the
builder went bust in the 1928
Cement Famine and had to melt down
his Chrysler to make the pointy bit
at the top. If you peer closely you
can still make out remnants of a
hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk
twice if you voted Hoover.'

NAME: Person_2
That was a joke, folks. It was
built for the Chrysler corporation.

NAME: Person_2
The spire is a beauty, especially
on a winter's morning when the sun
hits it and it just seems to...

NAME: Person_2
1047 feet madam, not allowing for
pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.

NAME: Person_1
Can I join your tour please?

NAME: Person_2
Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the
free authentic street pretzel.
Sorry, my bosses make the prices.

NAME: Person_2
Sorry. I can't take cards.
Ah, owe me it. I start on that
corner every day on the hour...

NAME: Person_2
Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't
your braille windshield work?

NAME: Person_1
Wow. What did you say?

NAME: Person_2
Just generalised criticism of his
parents and genitals.
Everyone make it over alive?
Excellent. Next we enter Times
Square, world famous for New Year's
Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball
descends at eye-poppingly slow
speed for the inexplicable
entertainment of a million drunk
fools. Many people think the square
is actually a square, despite
blatant evidence otherwise.
Sir? What shape is Times Square?

NAME: Person_1
A circle?

NAME: GRUMPY Side_22
When do we get the pretzel?

NAME: Person_2
Soon, sir. Soon.

NAME: Person_2
Okay, next the very Laundromat once
used by George Gershwin, Donald
Trump...

NAME: Person_2
...Mr Big from Sex and the City and
three of the 9-11 terrorists.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, dad.

NAME: Person_2
The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank
himself to death at the Chelsea
Hotel half an hour after losing a
sock in this very dryer.

NAME: Person_2
Are you abusing the tour to stalk
me?

NAME: Person_1
Absolutely.

NAME: Person_1
These things are amazing. Have you
ever put all your father's clothes
on and just got inside one?

NAME: Person_3
Where the blazes is that boy?
Arthur!

NAME: Person_2
Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's
crown, the Empire State Building.
This iconic symbol of American
corporate might was adapted during
World War 2 in case of attack from
enemy forces. At three minutes'
notice the entire structure can
retract into the ground like a
tortoise's head.

NAME: Side_31
That's not possible. I should know,
I'm a civil engineer.

NAME: Person_2
You're not being very civil to me.

NAME: Person_1
The building doesn't retract; the
ground rises up.

NAME: Person_2
Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank
you, sir.

NAME: Person_1
They were going to install giant
legs so if a plane was flying at
the tower it could run away. But
where's it going to run?

NAME: Person_2
Manhattan's in the way.

NAME: Person_1
It'd have to jump in the Hudson.

NAME: Person_2
Victory to the Nazis. Is that what
you want?

NAME: Person_2
Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits.

NAME: Person_2
Do I know you from somewhere?

NAME: Person_1
If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.

NAME: Person_2
What are they?

NAME: Person_1
The gossip websites.

NAME: Person_2
That the internet? Ah, my
computer's too old for all that.

NAME: Person_1
For the internet? Seriously?

NAME: Person_2
Life's too short for all this
obsessive upgrading.

NAME: Person_1
You consider the internet an
upgrade? Wow.

NAME: Person_2
So why do people gossip about you?

NAME: Person_1
Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.

NAME: Person_3
You're late for your mother!

NAME: Person_3)
The soup kitchen's just up and to
the left, honey.

NAME: Person_1
Hobson, this is...
Naomi.

NAME: Person_2
She's with you?

NAME: Person_3
Delighted to meet you, Naomi.
Normally one has to go to a bowling
alley to meet a woman of your
stature.

NAME: Person_2
Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.

NAME: Person_3
You aren't the first woman who
walks the streets this young man
has asked.

NAME: Person_2
Who's this? Joan Rivers' older
bitterer sister?

NAME: Person_1
My nanny.

NAME: Person_2
Obviously. Seriously, who is she?

NAME: Person_1
My nanny. Well, she started as
that, but these days she's more of
an all-round enforcer and
bodyguard.

NAME: Person_2
Sorry, I have to get out the cattle
prod and haul ass. Got another tour
starting in eight minutes.

NAME: Person_1
Can I call you?

NAME: Person_2
I don't give my number to grown men
with nannies. But as you may not be
a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.

NAME: Person_1
But what if this is the one?

NAME: Person_3
This is just like the Komodo
dragon. Everyone else is happy to
see one in the zoo and leave it
there. You had to own one. Thank
goodness that handbag manufacturer
was prepared to take the poor
lizard away.

NAME: Person_3
He is, Arthur. Are you the only one
allowed to joke now?

NAME: Person_1
I don't like it here.

NAME: Person_3
Of course you don't. People work
here.

NAME: Person_1
Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your
parents are you most like?
Abercrombie or Fitch?

NAME: Side_5
I have no connection with that
store. My family name is Von
Krausehoff. Take a seat please.

NAME: Side_5
Vivienne?
White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.

NAME: Person_3
Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take
long. Then we'll have ice cream.

NAME: Person_4
Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Vivienne.

NAME: Person_4
You know I prefer `mother'.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. You look more like a
Vivienne.

NAME: Person_4
So. How are you, Arthur?

NAME: Person_1
Quite busy. I have a riding boot
shoot for Petrie Dressage...

NAME: Person_1
What else...I'm meeting Ivanka
Trump for brunch to discuss the
environment. She's sending her
helicopter to avoid the traffic...

NAME: Person_1
Crashed my Batmobile into the
bronze bull on Wall Street...

NAME: Person_1
...which caused a hole to swallow
up the New York Stock Exchange...

NAME: Person_1
..the world economy to collapse and
the planet to descend into looting
and cannibalism.

NAME: Person_1
What else? Um...tripped over in the
shower this morning. Head split
open, found a family of meerkats
hiding in there! Hated the thought
of the little lads being homeless
so I bricked up the remaining half
of my brain, popped them back in
and Hobson glued my skull back
together.

NAME: Person_1
I'm thinking of buying a giant. I
think the market's right for it.

NAME: Person_1
You really are a shoddy mother.

NAME: Person_4
Did I hear you say you were meeting
Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's
nice. Right. Today we're going to
have a friendly chat. Then a
serious talk. And lastly make a
timetable. How does all that sound?

NAME: Person_1
Amazing. Do you have any vodka?

NAME: Person_4
What happened, Arthur? You were
such a sweet baby.

NAME: Person_1
I still wake up in my own poo
occasionally.

NAME: Person_4
Right, that's it for the chat. Time
to transition to our talk.

NAME: Person_4
This insanity has to end, Arthur.
As the delightful coffee-coloured
gentleman who runs this country
said, `The time has come to set
aside childish things.'

NAME: Person_1
Can't Hobson set them aside for me?

NAME: Person_4
Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet
are on the ground, she's of fine
stock...

NAME: Person_4
And? You think I spent my marriage
to your father skipping through
meadows?

NAME: Person_1
Not after you ran him over in the
Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's
not funny.

NAME: Person_4
Ditto your father. The aristocracy
doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur.
It's about stability. Continuity...

NAME: Person_1
...and sinking your fangs into
Susan's father's bank account.

NAME: Person_4
The Johnson family's considerable
equity in a stormy financial period
is merely a side issue. Burt is a
pillar of the community.

NAME: Person_1
His baby formula was taken off the
market in six African countries!

NAME: Person_4
A completely innocent error in
places where there's precious
little for children to live for
anyway. The families all got gift
baskets as compensation. That
little bump in the road aside, Burt
is a devout Christian.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, because they're never insane.
And where did he get Jesus?

NAME: Person_1
He strangled a fireman! Who
strangles a fireman?

NAME: Person_4
Arthur...

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met
someone else very lovely who, as
far as I know, isn't related to
anyone who would kill an unsung
hero in cold blood.

NAME: Person_4
Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end
of our line. We need an heir.

NAME: Person_1
I nearly gave you an heir!

NAME: Person_4
Oh, give me strength! A Bach-
Templemead having a child by a lap
dancer called `Mystery'?

NAME: Person_1
That was just her stage name! To
give her more mystery when
she...waved her fanny around. Her
real name was...what was it again?

NAME: Person_4
Susan is 33 this year. Her egg
inventory has dropped by 23% since
you met her. You risk having no
sons, or worse, some pea-brained
hunchback who hugs everyone!

NAME: Person_1
Great! I like hugs! And some of
them are really good at math.
You know the `Frog and Toad' books?

NAME: Person_4
No.

NAME: Person_1
Of course you don't. Hobson read
them to me while you were off
riding horses over stripey poles.
They're about fun and friendship,
not how many unspasticated tadpoles
I can squirt up a rich girl.

NAME: Person_4
Your father would turn in his grave
to hear this nonsense...

NAME: Person_1
That I won't follow in his
footsteps and marry a woman I hate?
I think he might climb out of the
grave and dance on it.

NAME: Person_4
Suit yourself.

NAME: Person_4
My will, which I have updated to
designate Grant in reception as the
sole beneficiary.

NAME: Person_1
You wouldn't! You're my...

NAME: Person_4
...Vivienne? Try me.

NAME: Person_4
Shall we segue to the timetable
part of our meeting?

NAME: Person_3
Ah. The ring your father gave your
mother, I recall.

NAME: Person_1
Did he knock her out with it, then
drive her to the church in the
trunk of his Bentley?

NAME: Person_3
No. Your father was a gentleman.

NAME: Person_1
What's gentlemanly about dying
before I knew him? That's just
rude. Did he ever love my mother?

NAME: Person_3
They had their days.

NAME: Person_1
Ah well. At least he doesn't have
to wake up every day to a woman
with a face like saran wrap
stretched over a gargoyle.

NAME: Person_1
What about Naomi?

NAME: Person_3
Arthur. I say this with love:

NAME: Person_1
Uh-oh...

NAME: Person_3
Even by modern male standards
you're a breathtakingly immature
little shit. Coupled with the kind
of money you have access to, that's
deadly. Susan may not have a four
hour stand up routine about the
Flatiron Building, but she's a
solid girl who will look after you.

NAME: Person_1
I have you for that.

NAME: Person_3
Not forever.

NAME: Person_1
Yes forever. You're Hobson.

NAME: Person_2
Hello?
Hello?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, I've never really
understood that question. Are you
free tomorrow night?

NAME: Person_2
Sorry, I'm polishing my yacht.

NAME: Person_1
Is that a euphemism for something
naughty?

NAME: Person_2
No, it's a lie. I have a creative
writing class. Tonight?

NAME: Person_1
I have a contractual commitment.
Friday?

NAME: Person_2
You got it.

NAME: Person_1
Paper.

NAME: Person_2
Sorry?

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, I was talking to something
else. So. What do you want to do?

NAME: Person_2
A movie?

NAME: Person_1
Movie? Come on, you've got to try
harder than that.

NAME: Person_2
Pizza.

NAME: Person_1
What have you always wanted to do?

NAME: Person_2
It's a first date, Arthur. Not our
honeymoon.

NAME: Person_1
Every date will be our honeymoon.

NAME: Person_1
What sort of food do you like?

NAME: Person_2
Anything but guts and mushrooms.
Okay, enough questions.

NAME: Person_1
Oh come on. This all helps build up
a profile of you before I trick you
into my basement. I'd hate to not
have your favourite snacks ready.

NAME: Person_2
Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done?
Just that I....

NAME: Person_3
Time to get engaged, Arthur. The
Komodo dragon can wait.

NAME: Person_1
Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?

NAME: Side_14
No, sir. It's 8.34.

NAME: Person_1
FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can
be a real cunt sometimes, don't you
think? I'll be right back. See you
in an hour and a half ago...

NAME: Side_14
Would you care for anything while
you wait?

NAME: Person_1
A trampoline and a selection of
woodland creatures if that's not
too much trouble.

NAME: Person_1
Ah!
Shhhhh...

NAME: Person_1
Bollocks.
Sorry. Actually, you couldn't,
um....you know...
...turn this into a nice 1990
Romanee Conti, could you?

NAME: Person_1
Cheers ears.

NAME: Person_1
`Genuine Sword of the First
Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.

NAME: Person_1
Jesus Fucking Christ!
Sorry. It's not like you shouted
`Arthur Fucking Bach' when they
pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject.

NAME: Person_1
Feel the force, Luke.

NAME: Person_6
Arthur!

NAME: Person_1
I, er, had a bit of food stuck in
my teeth and couldn't find a
toothpick.

NAME: Person_6
Heck, this sword went through three
crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems.
Nothing you can do to harm it.

NAME: Person_1
You don't, um, have anything
stronger, do you?

NAME: Person_6
Sparkling.

NAME: Person_6
`The drunkard and the glutton shalt
come to poverty: and drowsiness
shalt clothe a man with rags.'

NAME: Person_1
Surely a glass of sherry at
Christmas?

NAME: Person_6
Peace be with you.

NAME: Person_1
And also with me.

NAME: Person_6
Arthur. Can I be honest with you?

NAME: Person_1
You're the real Slim Shady? I knew
it!

NAME: Person_6
My faith teaches me to hate the
sin, not the sinner. But with you,
I struggle with that belief.

NAME: Person_1
You could switch to Judaism.
Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I
put the fan on?

NAME: Person_6
Anyway, Arthur. However I feel
about you, my daughter loves you.

NAME: Person_1
Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?

NAME: Person_1
Let's knock our heads together and
find a way to stop her loving
me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on
the sex offenders register....No, I
am and she knows.
Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay!
I did once dabble actually, so I
can tell a plausible story.

NAME: Person_6
You made love to a guy?

NAME: Person_1
One Moslem doesn't make a mosque,
Burt.

NAME: Person_6
You made love to a Moslem?

NAME: Person_1
No, sir, it was Prince Alois of
Lichtenstein and he made love to
me. The fact that it took three
bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
full of Krug to loosen me up
confirmed my heterosexuality.

NAME: Person_6
`If there is a man who lies with a
male, they shall surely be put to
death.'

NAME: Person_1
Crikey. Couldn't there just be some
kind of on-the-spot fine?

NAME: Person_6
You will stop this talk and marry -
my - fucking...

NAME: Person_1
Oh bollocks.

NAME: Person_1
It's a miracle! He is risen!

NAME: Person_1
Hi Susan. Erica.

NAME: Person_5
Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I
was talking to your mother. I hear
you have something to ask me!

NAME: Person_1
Shall we go?

NAME: Person_1
Do you have something with less
words please? The chef doesn't have
to re-cook it, just scrape off the
nouns and trim out all that
gibberish in the middle.

NAME: Person_5
He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do
the skate in wood ear mushroom.

NAME: Side_15
Excellent decision. Sir?

NAME: Person_1
A bowl of champagne and a spoon.

NAME: Person_5
Arthur, did you really have to be
so icky to Dominic?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. I just can't handle the
whole specials act. It's not a
Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some
heated up dead things that aren't
on the main menu.

NAME: Person_5
You know, I was grumbling to your
mother about how things are with us
sometimes. How I'm sure you're
trying to drive me away...

NAME: Person_1
Um hm.

NAME: Person_5
But she was explaining that
relationships are like property
purchases; invest only in high-end
stock, avoid anyone 'up-and-
coming', then hold onto the
property through thick and thin to
deliver maximum return! Isn't that
darling?

NAME: Person_1
Is it possible to buy the house but
then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm
not suggesting pimping you.

NAME: Person_1
Look. You after our first child is
born.

NAME: Person_5
Arthur. Why can't you learn to
laugh at genuinely amusing things?

NAME: Person_1
Such as?

NAME: Person_5
YouTube clips of babies giggling.
Dane Cook.

NAME: Person_1
Susan. Why are we together?

NAME: Person_5
I love you, Arthur. And you love
me, whatever you think.

NAME: Person_1
We don't have the same sense of
humour. We don't like the same
films, food, music. You like
horses, I think they're arrogant
idiots...

NAME: Person_5
Don't they say opposites attract?

NAME: Person_1
That depends on the opposites.
Racists and the Nation of Islam
don't secretly want to 69 each
other. Susan, you're beautiful.
You're bright. You're fucking
loaded. Is there really no one else
who could make you happy?

NAME: Person_5
No.

NAME: Person_1
Never?

NAME: Person_5
Well, I had a thing at college.
That was serious for a while. But
daddy...

NAME: Person_1
Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it
not to work out, then shot the
bloke behind a meat truck? Because
Jesus would consider that cheating.

NAME: Person_5
Ask me, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Susan. You're the only woman...at
this table.

NAME: Person_5
You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody
who drinks like you can be happy.

NAME: Person_1
How do you know? What if the
drunker I get the better it is for
me? Not everyone who drinks is a
poet, Susan. Some of us drink
because we're not poets.

NAME: Person_5
A real woman could stop you from
drinking.

NAME: Person_1
It'd have to be a real big woman.

NAME: Person_5
Ask me, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Susan. Would you marry me? Take the
weekend if you want...

NAME: Person_5
Yes, I'll marry you.

NAME: Side_15
Ladies and gentleman - the happy
couple!

NAME: Person_5
Erica will be the planner.

NAME: Person_1
Erica? She hates me.

NAME: Person_5
Who I love, she loves.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, come on. She always looks like
she wants to set fire to my face
then put it out with an Uzi.

NAME: Person_1
What's going on? I only just bloody
proposed!

NAME: Person_1
What have I done, Kitt? This
mistake's up there with Hitler
joining his school debating team...

NAME: Person_3
And stop this self-pitying bibble.
You're going to be fabulously rich.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe I'd rather be fabulously
poor. Some poor people I see look
happy.

NAME: Person_3
That's either because they're far
away or you've just given them
money. Arthur, poor people have to
work. They stand for hours in the
rain, waiting for buses full of
other poor people to take them to
things called `jobs' which they do
all year round to pay for holidays
away from those jobs.

NAME: Person_1
Don't patronise me. I have a job.

NAME: Person_3
Lying drunk on a bale of hay in
riding boots being photographed by
another pampered prick won't
prepare you for the work I mean.
And I don't want to see you suffer.
Take your fish oil.

NAME: Person_7
When are we getting cable?

NAME: Person_7
Honey, that's some bullshit aerial
from the 99 cent Store!

NAME: Person_2
It's a satellite dish!

NAME: Person_7
I read the box! It said `No
satellite fees to pay because does
not receive satellite signals!'
That's like saying `Hey - eat this
plate of broken glass! It won't
make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'

NAME: Person_2
It's better than nothing.

NAME: Person_7
No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but
you're even cheaper than your mom.
And she bought food from yard
sales.

NAME: Person_2
I miss her too, daddy. But now
she's gone and if I'm going to keep
you in grits and Oprah the rest of
your life, you live by my rules.

NAME: Person_7
But you live like you're preparing
for a war. And you earn a decent
salary.

NAME: Person_2
So? I want to know I can look after
you.

NAME: Person_7
What's he do, this English bum?

NAME: Person_2
Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.

NAME: Person_7
Yeah and I bet that girl said the
same about her date. Honey, stay
home. I don't want you ending up
like that poor girl.

NAME: Person_2
A bad actress holding her breath?

NAME: Person_2
Stop watching CSI.

NAME: Person_1
Or road awareness.

NAME: Person_1
Can you put this on please?

NAME: Person_2
On a first date? Are you crazy?

NAME: Person_1
Trust me.

NAME: Person_2
Arthur. We're in Battery Park at
night. I've met you once - in the
company of your nanny. You make a
disturbing number of jokes about
stalking and basements. My dad
already has you down as a mass
murderer. And you want me to put on
a blindfold?

NAME: Person_1
I give you my word - if I kill and
eat you, you'll never see me again.

NAME: Person_2
Okay, I'm officially a little
worried.

NAME: Person_1
You said you wanted a picnic.

NAME: Person_2
Arthur, I don't know what to say.
It's beautiful.
Who did all this?

NAME: Person_1
The picnic fairies. Who liaised
with the flower fairies, the candle
fairies, the log fire fairies, the
hidden sound system fairies...

NAME: Person_1
...and the pizza fairies.

NAME: Person_2
Did you take account of the heroin
fairies who hang here at night?

NAME: Person_1
It's nice to keep it simple like
this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
restaurants. All that embarrassing
crap with the specials.

NAME: Person_2
Are you kidding? Where I normally
eat, the special's the one that
comes with a free toy.

NAME: Person_2
You're rich rich, aren't you?

NAME: Person_1
I get by.

NAME: Person_2
`It doesn't remotely matter how
much or what you spend it on' rich?

NAME: Person_2
Craziest thing you ever bought?

NAME: Person_1
I once inadvertently financed a
terrorist cell who said they needed
100,000 to open a falafel stall.

NAME: Person_2
Oh my G-d, you're serious.

NAME: Person_1
What's the craziest thing you ever
told a tour party?

NAME: Person_2
I once said the Manhattan we were
in was actually a movie set built
for `You've got Mail', but that
after the film wrapped, everyone
moved to the set because there was
less crime.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
butter knife about two inches from
his hand but it might take him
eight months to dismember me with
it.
Gotta go, battery. Love you too.

NAME: Person_2
Mom died last year. For eight
months dad ate nothing but Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
CSI. So I persuaded him to move in
with me. Where he eats Popeye's
Chicken n' Biscuits in front of

NAME: Person_1
Sounds like you're very good to
him.

NAME: Person_2
What are you gonna do? All those
years your folks tucked you in, did
their best to stop you from eating
crap in front of the TV. And then
one day, you're the one saying `No,
honey, it's bad for you! Go to
bed.' Weird, huh?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I hate that.
Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
find that?

NAME: Person_2
AT&T store in 1998.

NAME: Person_1
It's...You've had it twelve years?

NAME: Person_2
It's a fine phone. Battery life of
eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
right out of conversations.

NAME: Person_2
I can't believe these mofos who
gotta keep up with the latest
bullshit. CDs come along, so out
with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
out with the CDs. I just kept the
vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
incredibly hip once every 20
years....

NAME: Person_1
I couldn't decide between picnic in
the park and dinner with a view. So
it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
ace?

NAME: Person_2
No it is not ace, you crazy English
bastard! This is dangerous!

NAME: Person_1
Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put
these on.

NAME: Person_1
So what got you into the walking
tours?

NAME: Person_2
You're seriously making date small
talk while this is going on?

NAME: Person_1
Be still. Breathe deep.
`When you can be calm in the midst
of activity, this is the true state
of nature': Huanchu Daoeren.

NAME: Person_2
`Lower this freak show to the
ground and get me a cab': Naomi
Snart.

NAME: Person_1
Taste this truffle.

NAME: Person_2
What the hell. Gotta go sometime,
right? At least it won't be years
of pain like mom. Just a few
seconds of screaming and falling
with a truffle in my mouth.

NAME: Person_1
So anyway. The tours...

NAME: Person_1
What did you write?

NAME: Person_2
A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
childrens' publisher. Sunshine
Press'. The rejection letter was
the meanest thing I ever read.

NAME: Person_1
Kids can be so cruel...

NAME: Person_1
I told you, don't worry. These
crane people know what they're
doing!

NAME: Person_2
Not that kind of problem.

NAME: Side_16
Phone. And the watch. Hurry.

NAME: Person_1
Um. Out of interest, how did you
get up here?

NAME: Side_16
What you talkin' about, dog?

NAME: Person_2
Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed
by `Robbed in the sky'!

NAME: Person_2
This isn't funny, you lunatic.

NAME: Person_1
OWWW! You don't understand! We're
180 feet up in the sky!

NAME: Person_1
No, we're not high! Well we are,
but only in the literal sense.

NAME: Person_1
Hurry!

NAME: Person_2
I can't find it. Over here?

NAME: Person_1
No! That's the bouquet of world
hams!

NAME: Person_1
I had fun tonight.

NAME: Person_2
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but so did I.

NAME: Person_8
Summarising Phase Alpha: formal
wear for bridal attendants, groom's
attendants, mens' formal wear, St
John the Divine all confirmed...

NAME: Side_33
I'm sorry?

NAME: Person_1
In case I'm passed out drunk rather
than medically dead?

NAME: Person_8
Don't worry, Thomas. This whole
thing's just a joke to Arthur.

NAME: Person_4
Take this away.
Progress on the reception?

NAME: Person_8
Black inked at the Emery Roth Room
at the Ritz-Carlton.

NAME: Person_8
A first pass at the guest list.
Bride's family and friends:

NAME: Person_8
Groom's family and friends:

NAME: Person_8
We can arrange to screen off the
area behind your guests, Arthur. To
make it seem less desperate.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, everyone. that graphic's too
colourful and this hangover's a 7.6
on the Richter..the Sickter...

NAME: Person_8
Cakes, caterers, floral
arrangements, photographer...

NAME: Person_3
Will there be anything else, sir?

NAME: Person_1
No, thanks.

NAME: Person_4
No. You can leave.

NAME: Person_1
Why all this crap now? What's the
rush anyway?

NAME: Person_6
The wedding is in a month, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
A month? I was thinking more sort
of ten, fifteen years. Just to
really enjoy the anticipation of
the big day.

NAME: Person_8
Where are you going?

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, Dwight D. Bridalshower,
Operation Ball and Chain will have
to wait.

NAME: Person_1
Here we are.

NAME: Person_2
We're not going to end up in the
Hudson again, are we?

NAME: Person_1
I can promise you won't get wet.

NAME: Person_2
Are you okay?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, fine. Actually...

NAME: Person_2
Hey, Richey Rich. Want to go
somewhere really romantic?

NAME: Person_1
Everything is 99 cents?

NAME: Person_2
Yip. A whole penny less than those
bourgeois assholes at the Dollar
Store.

NAME: Person_1
`Warning: This product contains
chromium, which may be linked to
chronic bronchitis and reproductive
hazards."

NAME: Person_2
That one was on the news. Everyone
else recalled them, the pussies.
Not my 99 Cent!

NAME: Person_1
Maybe China's trying to wipe out
the west's children one by one.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, I love this place.

NAME: Person_1
Why?

NAME: Person_2
Well, I'd like you to believe it's
because I'm a poor girl reduced to
buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in-
a-can to Right Said Fred because I
don't know where my next paycheck
is coming from. But the truth is -
bargains get me hot. Got it from
ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?

NAME: Person_1
Yes please.

NAME: Person_2
Looking west, the ladies' hygiene
products. Note that the more
natural-sounding the name, e.g.
this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine
Spray, the more lethal chemicals it
contains. Watch out for the
products cunningly labelled to make
the dumber consumer think they're
getting the real thing: 'Special
J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt
Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup...

NAME: Person_2
And ah, the music: Dated sounds for
lonely people to buy cheap shit to.

NAME: Person_2
I once watched a woman shoplift an
8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her
panty hose to 'Everything I do, I
do it for you'.

NAME: Person_2
Why are you staring at me?

NAME: Person_1
Just fascinated.

NAME: Person_2
You're good at fascinated.

NAME: Person_1
You're good at fascinating.

NAME: Person_1
Are you okay? Let me help you.

NAME: Side_8
Not that one.

NAME: Person_1
This one?

NAME: Side_8
No. There's less beans in it.

NAME: Person_1
This one?

NAME: Side_8
No.

NAME: Person_1
This one?

NAME: Person_1
No. I think I hear a mouse inside.

NAME: Person_1
Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No
rodents. Packed.

NAME: Person_1
Quick, before someone gets it.

NAME: Person_1
Look. Us in a year's time.

NAME: Person_1
If you got ill, I'd care for you.

NAME: Person_2
I'll get ill.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get
out when they start playing Phil
Collins. Want to see how to get a
quarter from a shopping cart?

NAME: Person_8
Tiger Woods has confirmed!

NAME: Person_1
I didn't know you knew him.

NAME: Person_5
I don't.

NAME: Person_1
Why is he coming?

NAME: Person_5
He agreed to daddy's fee. This is
going to be the happiest day of my
life!

NAME: Person_5
Why is she here all the time?

NAME: Person_1
If you can bring Erica, I can bring
Hobson.

NAME: Person_5
She's my wedding planner.

NAME: Person_1
She's my Hobson.

NAME: Person_1
Reminiscent of a French castle
perched 500 feet above New York,
the penthouse was known from early
days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.

NAME: Person_2
A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta
have a second ballroom.

NAME: Person_1
Where George Gershwin and the
Astors danced to Shep Fields and
his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.

NAME: Person_1
Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred
Austere and Stingy Rogers.

NAME: Person_1
Behind the telephone box fish tank.
See you on the balcony.

NAME: Person_2
Hobson?

NAME: Person_3
He's not like other men, you know.

NAME: Person_2
I think I realised that as I
plunged into the Hudson with a
junkie. But I like him. He's fun.

NAME: Person_3
I know he is. That's the problem.

NAME: Person_2
What does that mean?

NAME: Person_3
I'm sure Arthur will explain.

NAME: Person_1
Your kids' book. What was it about?

NAME: Person_2
`Vlad the Inhaler'. About an
asthmatic boy detective.

NAME: Person_1
Be serious.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose
Heart Escaped'. It was about this
kid who wakes up to find his heart
has climbed out and is shinning
down the drainpipe to freedom.

NAME: Person_1
I love it.

NAME: Person_2
Rainbow Press said it was too
disturbing. But it wasn't literal -
there wasn't a kid lying there with
a gaping hole in his chest. It was
just this cute little heart
bouncing up and down shouting `You
can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm
paraphrasing.

NAME: Person_1
Did he catch the heart?

NAME: Person_2
Never got that far.

NAME: Person_2
You like the hooch, don't you?

NAME: Person_1
Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
There's this bit in a book Hobson
used to read me as a kid that says
it all: `We must stop eating
cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he
ate another.'

NAME: Person_2
Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and
Toad!

NAME: Person_1
So Frog took the box outside. He
shouted in a loud voice, `Hey
birds, here are cookies!' Birds
came from everywhere. They picked
up all the cookies in their beaks
and flew away. `

NAME: Person_1
Now we have no more cookies to eat'
`Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going
home now to bake a cake.'
Classic addict.

NAME: Person_2
That was beautiful. It's like you
read it yesterday.

NAME: Person_3
They ate wet sandwiches without
iced tea. They were two close
friends sitting alone together.

NAME: Person_1
I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She
isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my
toad.

NAME: Person_3
You're quite sure about this?

NAME: Person_1
Yes.

NAME: Person_3
Oh, bollocks.

NAME: Person_7
I don't know, honey. What's this
teabag even doing here? Couldn't he
make it in Lord of the Rings land?

NAME: Person_2
Not that it matters, but he's a
billionaire.

NAME: Person_7
You have my full permission to
marry him.

NAME: Side_5
Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!

NAME: Person_1
I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning
to ride you around the course next.
Her last boyfriend broke his ankle
jumping that ditch. Had to be
destroyed on the spot.

NAME: Person_4
Arthur. What's so urgent that you
had to come all the way out here?

NAME: Person_1
I'm in love. With a woman who isn't
exactly who you'd describe as
Susan. She's called Naomi.

NAME: Person_4
Arthur, we've been through this!

NAME: Person_1
Won't you at least meet her?

NAME: Person_4
What family is she from?

NAME: Person_1
The Snarts of Detroit.

NAME: Person_4
Never heard of them.

NAME: Person_1
No, because they're normal. She's a
walking tour guide, her dad's a
retired car worker.

NAME: Person_4
Susan will generate quality sons,
not oil-soaked car monkeys.

NAME: Person_1
Unbelievable! Why don't you just
keep me here, pay a servant to wank
me into a bottle once a day...

NAME: Person_4
Arthur...

NAME: Person_1
...then inject it all into a field
of heiresses and see who farts out
a thoroughbred first?

NAME: Person_4
We need an heir!

NAME: Person_1
Fine! You can have one with Stevey
Steroids here! Surely even your
uterus has had a face lift by now.

NAME: Person_1
None of your business, J Crew.

NAME: Side_5
You are so ungrateful to your
mother. She adores you!

NAME: Person_4
Arthur. Come back here.

NAME: Person_1
You can shove your inheritance up
your horse's arse!

NAME: Person_4
Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your
heart. But do be aware I consider
what you've squandered so far an
advance on your inheritance. That's
about $17 million.

NAME: Person_1
Why would you do that? You'd never
get it back.

NAME: Person_4
No. But you'd spend the rest of
your life in court. There's a
simple solution to all this. Marry
Susan. And cheat with the nobody
from Queens.

NAME: Person_2
Have you been at the cookies?

NAME: Person_1
I ate the whole jar.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, man. What? What?

NAME: Person_1
I'm engaged. To another Susan.
Woman. Engaged to another woman.

NAME: Person_1
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

NAME: Person_2
What are you talking about? This is
bullshit. Who do you think you are?
Is this some rich guy thing?

NAME: Person_1
I was going to tell you! I just...

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, yeah, you just.

NAME: Person_1
Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it
to get to this! I planned to just
be your friend but then I started
to fall for you and I thought `I
can't marry Susan, I might fall for
Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to
marry Susan or I'll be poor so I
won't fall for Naomi' But then I
did fall for you! Because you're
brainy and funny and gorgeous and
too smart to do walking tours.
You're too smart, Snart. Smart
Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.
Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne,
and I said `I can't marry Susan, I
love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I
don't know any more.

NAME: Person_2
You're frog.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if
you don't marry Susan, I'll make
you pay all the inheritance money
back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.
Okay she didn't laugh but she might
as well have, the evil cow. Because
it's like all the money ever and
they'll put not just me but both of
us in prison and your dad, like in
Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and
Oliver and....

NAME: Person_2
Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of
your personality earlier we
wouldn't be having this
conversation.

NAME: Person_1
Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?

NAME: Person_2
Why?

NAME: Person_1
'cause it'll reduce the proportion
of my life I'll spend feeling
utterly miserable.

NAME: Person_2
Bye, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Bea Arthur? What's she got to do
with all this?

NAME: Person_2
It's going to be okay. I'll get you
a beer, yeah?

NAME: Person_7
I just have to be alone for a
minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear
it...

NAME: Side_17
Hey. I got a question.

NAME: Person_2
Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants
to come home with me and butt in
with questions while I'm watching
Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'
Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,
long day. What's your question?

NAME: Side_17
How can I just let you walk away,
just let you leave without a trace?

NAME: Side_18
When I stand here taking every
breath with you, ooh...

NAME: Side_22 2
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.

NAME: Person_2
What is going on?

NAME: OLD Side_18
How can you just walk away from me,
when all I can do is watch you
leave?

NAME: TEENAGE BOY Side_31
'cause we've shared the laughter
and the pain...

NAME: Side_19
And even shared the tears.

NAME: Side_19
You're the only one who really knew
me at all.

NAME: Person_1
So take a look at me now, 'cause
there's just an empty space.
And there's nothing left here to
remind me, just the memory of your
face.

NAME: Person_1
Take a look at me now, `cause
there's just an empty space, And
you coming back to me is against
all odds and that's what I've got
to face...Just take a look at me
now.

NAME: Person_2
Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.
he's getting married. But I guess
he didn't choreograph that bit for
you.

NAME: Person_1
But..but this took ages to
rehearse. I had the frog outfit
specially made. These aren't actual
tourists.

NAME: Person_2
I gathered that, Arthur. Are you
capable of doing anything without
it being a grand gesture?

NAME: Person_1
What do you mean?

NAME: Person_2
It's like Hobson said. You're not
like other men. If you were normal,
if the money and the booze didn't
cloud everything, you'd deal with
the fact that you're engaged,
rather than just looking for ways
to win me back. But it was a lovely
routine, really. Fantastic outfit.

NAME: Person_1
I just wanted to see you.

NAME: Person_1
Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a
haircut! Hobson?

NAME: Person_9
It says here you shouldn't forget
to clean your junk. I guess that's
what...'genitahlio-ah' is.

NAME: Person_1
Marty? What are you doing there?

NAME: Person_9
Hobson left me in charge. She's
gone to bed. She had a headache.

NAME: Person_1
She's had quite a few headaches
lately.

NAME: Person_9
She blacked out.

NAME: Person_3
Put my bears back on, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
Not until you answer my question.

NAME: Person_3
I'm travelling down a white tunnel.
To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why
is it so hot? Who's the red
gentleman with the big pitchfork?

NAME: Person_1
Will you cut it out?

NAME: Person_3
Arthur. There are three books. This
is important. Take them back to the
library...

NAME: Person_1
Hobson, please. Don't die any more.
It's getting very boring.

NAME: Person_3
Arthur. Old women, like bears, get
sore heads. Are you okay? You look
a little lost.

NAME: Person_1
Naomi doesn't want to see me.

NAME: Person_3
A terrible shame she had to go. A
little tart like that could have
saved you a fortune in prostitutes.

NAME: Person_1
Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk
about Naomi that way again. What
gives you the right to be such a
snob? You're just...you're just...
Mary Poppins with a menopause!

NAME: Person_1
Hobson, I've never raised my voice
to you. I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_3
I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur,
you may be growing up.

NAME: Person_1
Do you want anything?

NAME: Person_3
I want to be younger.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, it's your job to be older.
Hobson. If you're feeling better
tomorrow, will you accompany me
somewhere?

NAME: Person_3
Of course, Arthur.

NAME: Person_1
I can't have this getting out. I'm
in the public eye.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, it would be disastrous to harm
such a dignified profile.

NAME: Person_3
It's going to be okay, Arthur.

NAME: Side_20
I was waking up four, five, six
mornings a week in different mens'
beds...

NAME: Side_20
I wanted to die. To be nobody.

NAME: Side_21
I steal from my friends, my family.
I sold my son's pedal car so I
could score junk...

NAME: Person_1
Jesus....

NAME: Side_21
I accidentally backed my car over
my mother outside Walgreens...

NAME: Person_1
Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know
about anyone else, but this isn't
exactly killing my thirst.

NAME: Side_37
Well why did you come...What's your
name?

NAME: Person_1
Gandalf.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, you're not going to
convince me my life isn't fun.
And no offence but if I ran over my
mother, I'd be out celebrating.
Which is what I plan to do right
now. Come on, Hobson. Marty.

NAME: Person_3
...and because I have done nothing
with the astonishing opportunities
handed to me, apart from pissing
away my inheritance and drinking
enough to kill a rhino.

NAME: Person_3
But imagine being me! I once ended
up in bed with the daughters of
three of the Rolling Stones. But a)
I don't remember a thing about it,
b) apparently I was sick on two of
the women before c) losing control
of my bladder on the third. All
such fun...until the strangers I
pay to be my friends have gone, the
fog parts and there's a hole so
big, you could pour all the
champagne in the world into it and
never fill it up. But I've got so
much potential, a good heart, I'm a
good person, even if I've
completely wasted my short,
precious life because I somehow
convinced myself that happiness is
a Komodo dragon, a case of booze
and the memory of having once
stripped naked to Beethoven for a
coachload of German tourists who I
met outside the Rainforest Cafe.

NAME: Person_1
It's always the quiet ones.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go
every time I crave a drink?

NAME: Person_1
Susan? Look, I know the wedding
date is set. But fancy bringing it
forward? I just want to get it over
with. In a good way. Think about
it, yeah?

NAME: Person_1
It's the agony of possibility,
Hobson. It just hurts too much to
know I could still be with Naomi if
I had the guts.

NAME: Person_3
Just promise you'll never ask me to
sleep with Susan for you.

NAME: Person_2
Arthur, if that's...
Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.
Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty
hard on it..Love to...Love
to...What time?

NAME: Person_2
I'll call in dead to work. Bye.

NAME: Person_3
Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi
here?

NAME: Person_7
You must be the nanny.

NAME: Person_3
I must be.

NAME: Person_3
Please stop this, I can't inhale
and am in danger of treading on one
of your knuckles.

NAME: Person_3
If you and your undershirt would
walk two paces back I could enter
this dwelling.

NAME: Person_2
Well, well.

NAME: Person_7
Ever since I met Arthur I liked
him. We have to make sure these two
wonderful kids stay together...

NAME: Person_3
Try not to talk. It's not your
words but the breath which bears
them. Perhaps you could repair to
the East Wing and make me a cup of
tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.

NAME: Person_7
Sure, sure.

NAME: Person_3
Arthur is having a pre-wedding
party tonight. You should come.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, should I? Are all the other
girls he passed up going too?

NAME: Person_3
Don't you want to show Arthur how
well you're doing?

NAME: Person_2
Tell him thanks, but I have a
deadline.

NAME: Person_3
Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's
far too decent to be involved in
something so tawdry. You could
bring your father. A magical
experience before he's too big to
leave this apartment.

NAME: Person_3
My dear, if there's one thing old
women can tell, it's young men in
love. And the food promises to be
breathtakingly free.

NAME: Person_2
Are you alright?

NAME: Person_3
Better than you, dear.

NAME: Person_2
You really look out for Arthur,
don't you?

NAME: Person_3
Yes. And it is a job that I
recommend highly.

NAME: Person_3
You really look out for this
gentleman, from what I've heard.

NAME: Person_2
Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill
pet shelter won't take him.

NAME: Person_3
Thank you. Would you go the
bathroom and commence washing? You
only have three hours and it could
be quite a project.

NAME: Person_2
I appreciate what you're trying to
do but I'm not going to that party.

NAME: Person_3
Suit yourself.

NAME: Person_2
Have you seen a doctor?

NAME: Person_3
Yes. And he has seen me.

NAME: Person_2
I think Arthur has a very good
friend. May I kiss you on the
cheek?

NAME: Person_3
Is it something you feel strongly
about?

NAME: Person_2
Yes.

NAME: Person_2
Dad! Call 911.

NAME: Side_38
Thanks. We're going to move things
up tempo now with `The Only Thing
That Looks Good On Me Is You.'

NAME: Person_4
Splendid affair, Susan.

NAME: Person_5
Don't thank me, thank Erica.

NAME: Person_2
With all due respect, Hobson,
you're talking out of your frumpy
English ass. Arthur needs to know!

NAME: Person_3
You are not to pull him out of that
party on my behalf.
Hello? Naomi!

NAME: Person_7
You're gonna get through this,
babe. Then who knows what the
future may hold?

NAME: Side_9
Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?

NAME: Person_2
Snart plus one.

NAME: Side_39
Nice dress. Vera Wang?

NAME: Person_2
Ross Dress For Less. You know where
Arthur is?

NAME: Person_6
When Arthur proposed to my
daughter, I was overjoyous. The
Bach-Templemeads are my kind of
people: classy. Respectable. Well
spoken. People like in Shakespeare
in Love, who esprouse the same
values I have always upheld both in
my business and spiritual life. But
tonight isn't about me or America's
leading independent formula brand.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you, Burt! I've actually
prepared a little surprise song
with my friends here.

NAME: Person_1
Why does cash suddenly appear,
every time you are near?

NAME: Person_1
Just like me, it longs to be, close
to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the
sky, all of which, I can buy...
I'll sing a proper song.
You say potayto and I say potahto,
You say tomayto and I say tomahto,
potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto,
Let's call the whole thing off! You
say AA, and I say `no way', you say
`Red Bull' and I say `Go away,
Rehab, No way, Red Bull...

NAME: Side_1
We meet again!

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?

NAME: Side_1
The ballroom. I'll take you to him.

NAME: Side_1
I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.

NAME: Side_1
Isn't she beautiful?

NAME: Person_2
Of course she is. Why would Arthur
marry a pig?

NAME: Side_1
What business is your family in?

NAME: Person_2
Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a
fortune built on small pets.

NAME: Side_1
I'm sorry?

NAME: Person_2
Hamsters, mice, doglets...

NAME: Side_1
Doglets?

NAME: Person_2
Tiny dogs. The technology's not
perfect. Seeing a horse the size of
a can of soup fall dead before your
eyes - that shit stays with you.

NAME: Person_2
Are you sure he's this way?

NAME: Side_1
Absolutely.

NAME: Person_2
Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?

NAME: Side_40
That way. The ballroom.

NAME: Person_2
Bye, Justin.

NAME: Side_9
Excuse me, madam. You're not an
authorized guest.

NAME: Person_2
I know that. I'm here to give
Arthur some very important news.

NAME: Side_9
Of course you are.
Shall we discuss this outside?

NAME: Person_1
It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.

NAME: Person_2
Arthur, can I talk to you?

NAME: Side_41
We ran tests. It was just a dizzy
spell. We'll be sending her home
tonight.

NAME: Person_1
But what about the other blackouts?

NAME: Person_3
Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that
party.

NAME: Person_1
She's fine. They're sending her
home. Do you want a drink?

NAME: Person_2
No, thanks, Arthur. I should go.

NAME: Person_1
But you came all this way. There's
ridiculously fancy food, there's...

NAME: Person_2
Arthur. Please. Can you just call
me a cab?

NAME: Person_1
You're a cab.

NAME: Person_1
Shit. Hobson usually...

NAME: Person_2
Orders cabs to take the girls away?

NAME: Person_1
Thank you for coming all this way.
I'm sorry for all the stupid
presents and calls and gestures.

NAME: Person_2
It's okay.

NAME: Person_2
She was a looker from the get-go.

NAME: Person_1
What were you like as a kid?

NAME: Person_2
Nuts. I thought the moon followed
me. I would walk and think the moon
went any place that I did. I
thought it meant something special
would happen. So I've been waiting.
What an ass.

NAME: Person_1
Dance?

NAME: Person_2
Arthur. We've been through this.
Call that cab please.

NAME: Side_42
To Bombay, a travelling circus
came, they brought an intelligent
elephant and Nellie was her name...

NAME: Person_1
Hobson used to sing it to me.
One dark night, she slipped her
iron chain. Off she ran to
Hindustan and was never seen again.
Nellie the Elephant packed her
bags, And said goodbye to the
circus, Off she went with a
trumpety trump, Trump trump
trump...

NAME: Person_4
Is this the tour guide?

NAME: Person_1
She's a writer.

NAME: Person_2
Is this the Vivienne?

NAME: Person_4
Crowded field, writing.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe someone will see her
potential.

NAME: Person_4
We all know who's seen her
potential.

NAME: Person_2
Meaning?

NAME: Person_4
Oh, of course, you don't know, do
you?

NAME: Person_1
Vivienne, please. Don't...

NAME: Person_2
What is going on here?

NAME: Person_4
My son became fond of you. You're
not the first. Or the last, I
imagine. Anyway I was scanning his
monthly expenses - which always
makes for entertaining reading, all
those gifts for all those girls -
and found he'd bought an entire
publishing company called...what
was it now? Rainbow Press.

NAME: Person_2
You bought Rainbow press? So you
could tell them to publish my book?

NAME: Person_4
He knows people, dear. I'm sure you
do too, though the people you know
tend not to own books, let alone
publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll
see you back at the party? Susan's
a little worried.

NAME: Person_1
Person_2! PLEASE! I didn't think I
would ever see you again. I was
just trying to give you some...

NAME: Person_1
I do express love! I love you!

NAME: Person_2
Don't say that!

NAME: Person_1
You just told me to! And stop going
on about me being rich! You think
it's easy being trapped by money?

NAME: Person_2
Hello, Amnesty? Come quick!
Arthur's being held against his
will in Guantamoney Bay!

NAME: Person_1
Abu Greed?

NAME: Person_2
Stop riffing with me! How dare you
do what you did. I didn't need your
money to feel good about myself!

NAME: Person_1
No. Being cheap gives you that.

NAME: Person_2
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
At least I'm prepared to have fun.
To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at
me with my antique food, aren't I
cool?' And...and...your phone's
RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old
doorbell and vibrator, I bet you
can only get calls from 1994 on it!

NAME: Person_5
Hello? I heard shouting.

NAME: Person_2
I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came
to complain about the conditions.

NAME: Person_1
Naomi, please...

NAME: Person_2
Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you
thought putting half and half in
the staff kitchen was an
improvement.
But some people prefer Coffee Mate!
You were disrespectful. I quit!

NAME: Person_5
Because you changed the creamer?
Arthur, Marty called from the
hospital.

NAME: Person_1
It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke
to her doctor.

NAME: Person_5
Apparently you didn't.

NAME: Person_3
It's just a headache!

NAME: Person_1
Stop saying that! You bribed a
hospital orderly to tell me you
were okay!

NAME: Person_3
Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors
know?

NAME: Person_1
Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing
costly, health-giving presents!

NAME: Person_1
'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'..
`A compilation of the band's most
stomach-churning music videos and
deathly live performances...'

NAME: Person_1
Put this on, please.

NAME: Person_3
I don't want to put it on.

NAME: Person_1
Put it on. Or I'll fire you.
Okay, or I won't fire you.

NAME: Person_9
She sounds like Darth Invader!

NAME: Person_3
Why, Arthur?

NAME: Side_43
...is determined to catch the
salmon, despite the treacherous
rapids...

NAME: Side_44
Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a
moment?

NAME: Person_1
Home? That's great news. Isn't it?

NAME: Person_1
How did this get here?

NAME: Person_3
I have no idea.

NAME: Person_1
You might have a brain tumour but
you're not a complete veggie burger
just yet. Has Naomi been here?

NAME: Person_3
She dropped by once or twice.
Frightful needy trollop.

NAME: Person_1
I thought she gave up writing.

NAME: Person_3
Just trying to spare her outright
humiliation while I'm still here.

NAME: Person_1
Don't wear yourself out. You're not
going anywhere soon.

NAME: Person_1
World's most advanced heart rate
monitor. The tiniest problem will
alert your own private platoon of
paramedics camped out downstairs...

NAME: Person_3
Arthur. I've loved caring for you
so much. But you'll never grow up
with me around. So either I retire.
Or I die. Option 1 involves too
much paperwork and blather with
having to find somewhere else to
live. And no offence to you, dear
boy...

NAME: Person_3
...but I think we've exhausted the
bear-based entertainment. Which
leaves option 2.

NAME: Person_3
You're a good son, Arthur. You can
do anything with your life that you
want. Just like I did.

NAME: Person_1
But you spent half of it looking
after a spoilt drunk twat.

NAME: Person_3
Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my
use-by date.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this
one. I need you to care for me.
Now take your fish oil.

NAME: Person_1
Hobson?

NAME: Person_3!
Why the fuck has the stupid thing
not gone off?

NAME: Person_1
Would Frog ever get up again? Or
would he just sit in his tank,
crying and soiling himself until he
died of dehydration because he
didn't even have the energy to eat
a wet sandwich.

NAME: Person_1
Hobson! Why are you in there when I
need you?

NAME: Person_1
Arrrrgghhh!

NAME: Person_1
Sorry.

NAME: Person_9
How's the tea?

NAME: Person_1
Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.

NAME: Person_9
Want to talk about the Cubs game?

NAME: Person_1
Nahhh. Can I be alone please?

NAME: Person_1
Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get
this, because your voicemail
probably consists of a 4000 year
old woman who writes the message
down in hieroglyphics then loses it
down the back of her incontinence
loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson
died and I've fallen apart...

NAME: Person_1
Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?

NAME: Person_4
Arthur! You haven't answered the
phone for eight days. Susan's
beside herself. What's going on?

NAME: Person_1
What do you think's going on?
Hobson died.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, that.

NAME: Person_1
You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?

NAME: Person_4
Well, yes. A faithful, humble
companion who...

NAME: Person_1
Um, I think I'd like you to leave,
if that's okay. Now?

NAME: Person_4
Remember who pays for this
apartment, Arthur. For everything!

NAME: Person_4
You had damn well better be at that
wedding, boy.

NAME: Person_1
Don't worry. If I'm going to drink
myself to death I'll need
resources. Bye Vivienne...

NAME: Person_4
It's mother!

NAME: Person_1
My mother's dead.

NAME: Person_1
Hello? I'm sorry?

NAME: Side_10
The last will and testament of Jane
Hobson.
`I leave my life savings to the
Tulare Bear Sanctuary, Tulare
County, California.'

NAME: Person_1
That'll explain the strong smell of
bear shit. Sorry.

NAME: Side_10
To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave
this.

NAME: Side_10
To operate kettle, press red
button. Milk in refrigerator;
that's the big box with the pretty
light that comes on when you open
the door.
Arthur. You're going to be okay.
Now it's your turn to look after
someone. All my deepest, fondest
love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling
down at you - or more likely, up at
you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx.

NAME: Person_6
I just want you to know, if he
doesn't show up for this wedding, I
can't know what I'll do.

NAME: Person_4
Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned
himself up. He's stopped drinking,
he's anxious to get a real job.
He's become a responsible citizen.

NAME: Person_2
Due to a tragic error in the
architect's drawing, the original
Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886
was just seven inches tall. 100,000
New Yorkers rioted, having come
expecting to see something more
impressive than a garden gnome
holding up an ice cream...

NAME: Person_1
Naomi!

NAME: Person_1
You're on a bus? With a microphone?

NAME: Person_2
Girl's gotta have a dream.

NAME: Person_1
Naomi. Can you take the next 60
years off?

NAME: Person_2
Are you okay? You're a mess. You
look like you...now.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry. I accidentally swallowed
three bottles of hand sanitizer.
Fascinating story...Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Drinking was the only way I could
get the courage to come here and
say this: I don't need the money. I
love the money. But I don't lie
awake all night wondering how I'll
live without ever seeing it again.
I just wonder what it's like to go

It's okay. So how did Susan take it
that you're not marrying her?

NAME: Person_1
She didn't.

NAME: Person_2
You haven't told her?

NAME: Person_1
What's it to you? She's your arch-
enemy.

NAME: Person_2
Are you six? She isn't my enemy.
She's the woman you proposed to!

NAME: Person_1
I couldn't tell her! Today's the
biggest day of her life!

NAME: Person_2
The wedding's today? When?

NAME: Person_1
12. Which is...
Where's my watch gone?

NAME: Person_2
It's eight minutes to.

NAME: Person_1

You want me to go there? Like this?

NAME: Side_22
Huh? I want to see St. John the

NAME: Person_2
Sorry, sir, that's not on our route

NAME: Side_18
I want to know if Arthur's gonna
make it.

NAME: OTHER Side_18
You should be there for him.

NAME: ALL OTHER Side_31S

NAME: Person_2
Okay!

NAME: Person_1
Ah! I'm trying to get to...

NAME: Side_50
Hey!

NAME: Person_1
I'm not him.
Look ma! No holes.

NAME: Person_5
Arthur? What's going on?

NAME: Person_1
Susan. I can't...I can't...

NAME: Person_5
What?

NAME: Person_1
The girl at the party? The one who
talked all that rubbish about
Coffee Mate? I love her.

NAME: Person_5
Shut up! We're getting married!

NAME: Person_1
But I don't love you!

NAME: Person_5
And you think I love you?

NAME: Person_1
Well, yes. What's not to...

NAME: Person_5
I never have.

NAME: Person_1
Susan, you're upset, you hate me.
It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to
go, or your dad's going to do
whatever he did to your boyfriend
from college.

NAME: Person_5
Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her
parents to send her away..

NAME: Person_1
HER? You're..a...

NAME: Person_5
Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed
that daddy is homophobic. He swore
he'd disown me if it happened
again.

NAME: Person_1
But...why do you want to marry...

NAME: Person_1
Hang on. Am I your beard?

NAME: Person_5
Why else do you think I'd spend
more than 30 seconds in your
company? You're the perfect cover.

NAME: Person_5
No.

NAME: Person_1
Wow. Wow. Well. Uh...
Thanks for your honesty. I don't
feel so bad about calling this off.

NAME: Person_5
Arthur, please. You can drink as
much as you like, sneak off to
Naomi. We keep the money. We live
our lives. Everyone wins.

NAME: Person_1
I may be a weak, pathetic drunk.
But I won't marry a lesbian Dane
Cook fan.

NAME: Person_1
Good evening, St. John the Divine!
Anyone in from St. Patrick's?
Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan
Mosque? AA?

NAME: Person_1
...and the first turned to the
second horse and said `That dog
just spoke'.

NAME: Person_1
The joke being that it's
inconsistent that the horses can
speak but the dog can't.

NAME: Person_1
The wedding's off. The bride has
had second thoughts. I can't say I
blame her. Would you marry me?

NAME: Person_1
Great. I'm glad we had this talk.
I'll let you get on with the
wedding....

NAME: Person_5
Daddy, no! Stop it!

NAME: Person_4
Burt! Get off my son!

NAME: Person_5
NAME: Person_6
You wouldn't hurt me.

NAME: Person_5
Wouldn't I? You crushed me.

NAME: Person_6
I just wanted you to be happy.

NAME: Person_5
Bullshit. You wanted to stop me
being a lesbian!

NAME: Person_6
Shut up! Shut up you dirty little
dyke harlot!

NAME: Person_8
You want some more, bitch? Huh?

NAME: Person_5
Erica, that's enough, honey.

NAME: Person_1
Why didn't you tell me? We could
have worked something out.

NAME: Person_1
I'm joking.

NAME: Person_1
OW! Stop it! Why are you doing
that?

NAME: Person_2
Because I hate an infection! Keep
still.

NAME: Person_1
No, you keep still.

NAME: Person_2
What are we going to do, Arthur?

NAME: Person_1
I'll get a job. I'll model cheap
riding boots for people with no
horses. You can write books about
boys whose lungs have run away.

NAME: Person_4
Stop this!

NAME: Person_4
A Bach-Templemead has never been
poor and we're not about to try
that experiment with you, Arthur.
That said, you've shown strength of
character for once, instead of
blubbing on about frogs and
friendship. The inheritance is
yours. All I ask is, with Hobson
gone, you finally start treating me
like a mother.

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.

NAME: Person_4
I beg your pardon?

NAME: Person_1
You've never earned that title. I
wouldn't fake it with Susan. I
won't with you.

NAME: Person_4
Arthur. I will withdraw this offer
forever. Don't doubt me, boy.

NAME: Person_1
I don't.

NAME: Person_1
Take care, Viv.

NAME: Person_4
Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If
you walk out of that door...

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any
more. Fancy joining us for a bowl
of Special J?

NAME: Person_1
Operational heat controls in a
shower are a basic human right!

NAME: Person_1
What the hell's in this shampoo?
Napalm? It sure as hell isn't tea
tree oil...

NAME: Person_7
Package for you. With any luck an
apartment for you and Lurch.

NAME: Person_1
I thought you liked me.

NAME: Person_7
I may have been seduced by money.
It happens.

NAME: Person_1
`Can I be your friend at least?
Love, Vivienne xxx. P.S. Lunch
sometime? P.P.S. The inheritance is
yours. It always was.'

NAME: Person_7
On balance, I'd go for it.

NAME: Person_9
Money good.

NAME: Person_2
You were never happy rich, honey.
It's only been a month. Be strong.
Remember: however hard life gets,
love will always find a way.

NAME: Person_2
What? Can't a girl make a joke?

NAME: Person_1
Brought her for moral support. But
I'll do the talking this time.

NAME: Side_6
Thebes. City of the Living. Crown
jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First.

NAME: Side_6
Home of Imhotep, High Priest of
Osiris, Keeper of the Dead.

NAME: Side_6
Birthplace of Anck-su-namun. Pharaoh's
Mistress. No other man was allowed
to touch her.

NAME: Side_6
But for our love, we were willing to
risk life itself.

NAME: Side_7
What are you doing here?

NAME: Side_7
Imhotep?... My priest.

NAME: Side_10
Pharaoh's bodyguards!

NAME: Side_8
You must go. Save yourself. Only you
can resurrect me.

NAME: Side_8
My body is no longer his temple!

NAME: Side_6/Person_6
For murdering Pharaoh, Anck-su-namun's
body was to be cursed. And it was I,
the High Priest, whose duty it was
to curse it.

NAME: Person_6
Her body was mummified, her vital
organs removed and placed in sacred
canopic jars.

NAME: Person_6
The Book of The Living contained
sacred incantations that would send
the evil dead on a journey into the
dark underworld.

NAME: Person_6
The slaves were killed...

NAME: Person_6
...and the soldiers who killed them
were also slain, so that no unholy
person should ever know the exact
location of the burial site.

NAME: Person_6
But there was another book, The Book
Of The Dead, which was never to be
opened, never to be read, for it
contained the incantations that could
bring a dead body back to life a
most unholy thing.

NAME: Person_6
It was hidden at Hamunaptra, City of
the Dead, inside the statue of Anubis,
so that no such sacrilege might ever
disgrace Egypt.

NAME: Person_6
But for my love of Anck-su-namun I
was willing to defy the gods.

NAME: Person_6
Anck-su-namun's vital organs were
still fresh, so a human sacrifice
would not need be made.

NAME: Person_6
Anck-su-namun soul had come back
from the dead! Now all that was
needed, was to return her organs to
their rightful place within her body.

NAME: Person_6
My Priests were condemned to be
mummified alive.

NAME: Person_6
As for me, I was condemned to endure
the HOM-DAI. The worst of all ancient
curses. One so horrible, it had never
before been bestowed.

NAME: Person_6
By eating the sacred scarabs, I would
be cursed to stay alive forever. And
by eating me, they were cursed just
the same.

NAME: Person_6
I was to remain sealed inside my
sarcophagus, the undead for all of
eternity.

NAME: Person_6
They would never allow me to be
released. For I would arise a walking
disease, a plague upon mankind, an
unholy flesh-eater, with the strength
of ages, power over the sands, and
the glory of invincibility.

NAME: Person_6
And if I could raise my beloved Anck-
su-namun from her place in hell,
together, we would be an unstoppable
infection upon this world. The
Apocalypse. The End.

NAME: Person_1
I knew this was gonna be a lousy
day.

NAME: Person_4
Personally, I would like to surrender.
Why can we not just surrender?

NAME: Person_1
Shut-up and gimme your bandolier.

NAME: Person_4
Then let's run away. Right now. While
we can still make it.

NAME: Person_1
Now gimme your revolver, you'll never
use it anyway.

NAME: Person_4
Then let's play dead, huh? Nobody
ever does that anymore.

NAME: Person_1
Now go find me a big stick.

NAME: Person_4
In the desert? What for?

NAME: Person_1
So I can tie it to your back, you
appear to be without a spine.

NAME: Person_1
How'd a guy like you end up in the
Legion anyways?

NAME: Person_4
I got caught robbing a synagogue.
Lots of good stuff in them holy
places; churches, temples, mosques,
and who's guarding them?

NAME: Person_1
Altar boys?

NAME: Person_4
Exactly! I speak seven languages,
including Hebrew, so my specialty
was synagogues. How about you? Kill
somebody?

NAME: Person_1
No, but I'm considering it.

NAME: Person_4
What then? Robbery? Extortion?
Kidnapping!

NAME: Person_1
None of the above, thank you.

NAME: Person_4
Then what the hell are you doing
here!?

NAME: Person_1
I was just looking for a good time.

NAME: Person_1
Oh shit. Steady!

NAME: Side_12
What the hell am I sayin'?

NAME: Side_12!
What the hell am I doin'?

NAME: Person_1
Son-of-a-bitch.

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Beni! Wait up!

NAME: Person_1
What are ya doing?! Wait up!

NAME: Person_1
Don't you close that door! DON'T YOU

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna get you for this!

NAME: Person_2
Tuthmosis?... Now how did you get up
here?

NAME: Person_2
Oops.

NAME: Person_5
Look at this! Sons of the Messiah!
Give me frogs, flies, locusts,
anything but this! Compared to you,
the other plagues were a joy!

NAME: Person_2
I'm sorry, it was an accident.

NAME: Person_5
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it
was an accident. You are a
catastrophe! Why do I put up with
you?

NAME: Person_2
You put up with me, because I can
read and write ancient Egyptian,
decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic,
and I'm the only person within a
thousand miles who knows how to
properly code and catalogue this
library.

NAME: Person_5
Who needs smart women? I put up with
you because your mother and father
were our finest patrons, Allah rest
their souls. Now straighten up this
mess!

NAME: Person_2
Hello?

NAME: Person_2
Abdul? Mohammed? Bob?

NAME: Person_2
You...! YOU...!

NAME: Person_3
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please
call me something original.

NAME: Person_2
Have you no respect for the dead?

NAME: Person_3
Right now, I only wish to join them.

NAME: Person_2
Well I wish you'd do it sooner rather
than later, before you ruin my career
the way you've ruined yours.

NAME: Person_3
My dear, sweet, baby sister, I'll
have you know, that at this moment
my career is on a high note.

NAME: Person_2
High note? Ha! For five years you've
been scrounging around Egypt, and
what have you to show for it? Nothing.

NAME: Person_3
Oh yes I do! I have something right
here!

NAME: Person_2
Oh no, not another worthless trinket,
Jonathan, if I bring one more piece
of junk to the Curator to try and
sell for you.

NAME: Person_2
Where did you get this?

NAME: Person_3
On a dig, down in Thebes.

NAME: Person_3
My whole life I've never found
anything, Evy. Tell me I've found
something.

NAME: Person_2
Jonathan?

NAME: Person_3
Yes?

NAME: Person_2
I think you found something.

NAME: Person_2
See the cartouche there, it's the
official royal seal of Seti the First,
I'm sure of it.

NAME: Person_5
Perhaps.

NAME: Person_3
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti
the First? And was he rich?

NAME: Person_2
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old
Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest
Pharaoh of them all.

NAME: Person_3
Alright, good, that's good. I like
this fellow, like him very much.

NAME: Person_2
I've already dated it, this map is
almost four thousand years old. And
the hieratics over here...
It's Hamunaptra.

NAME: Person_5
My dear girl, don't be ridiculous,
we are scholars, not treasure hunters.
Hamunaptra is a myth.

NAME: Person_3
Are we talking about the Hamunaptra?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. The City of The Dead. Where the
early Pharaohs were said to have
hidden the wealth of Egypt.

NAME: Person_3
Right, right, in a big underground
treasure chamber. Everybody knows
the story. The entire necropolis was
rigged to sink into the sand. On
Pharaoh's command, a flick of the
switch! And the whole place could
disappear beneath the dunes.

NAME: Person_2
All we know is that the city
mysteriously vanished around 2,134

NAME: Person_5
As the Americans would say: it's all
fairy tales and hokum.

NAME: Person_3
You burned it! You burned off the
part with the lost city!

NAME: Person_5
It's for the best, I'm sure. Many
men have wasted their lives in the
foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra, no
one has ever found it, most have
never returned.

NAME: Person_3
You killed my map.

NAME: Person_5
I'm sure it was a fake, anyway, I'm
surprised at you, Miss Carnarvon, to
be so fooled.

NAME: Person_2
You told me you found it on a dig
down in Thebes!

NAME: Person_3
I was mistaken.

NAME: Person_2
You lied to me!

NAME: Person_3
I lie to everybody, what makes you
so special?

NAME: Person_2
I'm your sister.

NAME: Person_3
That just makes you more gullible.

NAME: Person_2
You stole it from a drunk at the
local Casbah?!

NAME: Person_3
Picked his pocket, actually.

NAME: Person_2
And what is he in prison for?

NAME: Person_8
I did not know, so when I heard you
were coming, I asked him that myself.

NAME: Person_2
And what did he say?

NAME: Person_8
He said... he was just looking for a
good time.

NAME: Person_2
But he's just a filthy criminal?

NAME: Person_3
Way to go, Evy.

NAME: Person_1
So who's the broad?

NAME: Person_2
Broad?!

NAME: Person_3
She's my sister, actually.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a
total loss.

NAME: Person_8
I'll be back in a moment.

NAME: Person_1
I tremble with anticipation.

NAME: Person_2
We uh,... found... your puzzle box,
and we've come to ask you about it.

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Person_2
No?

NAME: Person_1
No... You came to ask me about
Hamunaptra.

NAME: Person_2
How do you know the box pertains to
Hamunaptra?

NAME: Person_1
Because that's where I found it. I
was there.

NAME: Person_3
How do we know that's not a load of
pig swallow?

NAME: Person_1
Hey,... don't I know you?

NAME: Person_3
Um, well, you see...

NAME: Person_2
You were actually at Hamunaptra?

NAME: Person_1
I just decked your brother

NAME: Person_2
Yes, well...
I know my brother.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I was there.

NAME: Person_2
You swear?

NAME: Person_1
Every damn day.

NAME: Person_2
No, I mean --

NAME: Person_1
-- I know what you mean. I was there,
alright. Seti's place. The City Of
The Dead.

NAME: Person_2
What did you find? What did you see?

NAME: Person_1
I found sand. I saw death.

NAME: Person_2
Could you tell me how to get there?
The exact location?

NAME: Person_1
Want to know?

NAME: Person_2
Yes.

NAME: Person_1
Really want to know?

NAME: Person_2
Yes.

NAME: Person_1
Then get me the hell outta here.

NAME: Person_2
Where are they taking him?

NAME: Person_8
To be hanged.

NAME: Person_8
Apparently, he had a very good time.

NAME: Person_8
No women allowed.

NAME: Person_2
I am an English woman.

NAME: Person_2
I will give you one hundred pounds
to spare his life.

NAME: Person_8
I would pay one hundred pounds just
to see him hang.

NAME: Person_2
Two hundred pounds.

NAME: Person_8
Proceed!

NAME: Person_2
Three hundred pounds!

NAME: Side_14
Any last requests, pig?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I'd like ya to let me go.

NAME: Person_8
And what else?

NAME: Person_8
His neck did not break! Good! Now we
watch him strangle to death.

NAME: Person_2
He knows the location to Hamunaptra.

NAME: Person_8
You lie.

NAME: Person_2
I would never!

NAME: Person_8
Are you saying this filthy godless
son of a pig knows where to find The
City Of The Dead? Truly?

NAME: Person_2
Yes and if you cut him down, we will
give you ten percent.

NAME: Person_8
Fifty percent.

NAME: Person_2
Twenty.

NAME: Person_8
Forty.

NAME: Person_1
Give... give him... give him GLAAAA--

NAME: Person_2
Twenty-five percent, and not one
single farthing more.

NAME: Person_5
She must die.

NAME: Side_5
She is like all the others. She will
die in the desert.

NAME: Person_5
No! She has seen too much. She knows
too much.

NAME: Person_5
Not only does she have a map, but
she has the key.

NAME: Side_5
The key!? She has the lost key!?

NAME: Person_5
Yes. No one has ever had so much,
been so close. We must stop her, or
it will be the end of us all.

NAME: Side_5
Then we will kill her, we will kill
her and all those with her.

NAME: Person_5
And burn the map and retrieve the
key.

NAME: Side_5
It will be done. But what of the
American expedition? They leave
tomorrow as well.

NAME: Person_5
Forget the bumbling Americans, they
will be like all the others. Without
the map to guide them, how can they
possibly find Hamunaptra?

NAME: Person_4
It is three days down the Nile, then
two days by camel, sahibs.

NAME: Side_1
For all the money we're paying you,
something better god-damned well be
under that sand.

NAME: Person_9
"Hamunaptra," Daniels, that's all ya
gotta keep sayin, to yourself,
"Hamunaptra."

NAME: Person_2
Do you really think he'll show up?

NAME: Person_3
Undoubtedly, I know the breed, he
may be a cowboy, but his word is his
word.

NAME: Person_2
Personally, I think he's filthy,
rude and a complete scoundrel. I
don't like him one bit.

NAME: Person_2
Oh... um,... hello.

NAME: Person_3
Smashing day for the start of an
adventure, eh, O'Connell?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, sure, smashing.

NAME: Side_4
You're sure Hamunaptra is out there?

NAME: Person_4
Along with the scorched bones of my
entire garrison, sahib.

NAME: Person_4
A thousand pardons, my good sahibs
but there is much work to be done.

NAME: Person_2
Mister O'Connell, can you look me in
the eye, and guarantee me this is
not some sort of flimflam? Because
if it is, I'm warning you --

NAME: Person_1
All I can tell you, miss, is that my
Colonel found that map in an ancient
fortress, and the whole damn garrison
believed in it so much, that without
orders, we marched halfway across
Libya and into Egypt to find that
city. Like I told ya, all I saw was
sand. Everybody else was wiped out
by Tuareg warriors. I'll take your
bags.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude,
a complete scoundrel, nothing to
like there at all.

NAME: Person_8
A bright good morning to all.

NAME: Person_2
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_8
I have come to protect my investment,
thank you very much.

NAME: Person_3
Sit down, O'Connell, sit down, we
could use another good player.

NAME: Person_1
I only gamble with my life, never my
money.

NAME: Side_1
Never? What if I were to wager five
hundred dollars says we get to
Hamunaptra before you?

NAME: Person_1
Yer on.

NAME: Side_4
What makes you so confident, sir?

NAME: Person_1
What makes you?

NAME: Person_9
We got us a man who's actually been
there.

NAME: Person_3
I say, what a coincidence, why --

NAME: Person_3
-- whose deal is it? Is it my deal?
I thought I just dealt?

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.

NAME: Person_2
The only thing that scares me, Mister
O'Connell, are your manners.

NAME: Person_1
Still angry that I kissed ya, huh?

NAME: Person_2
If you call that a kiss.

NAME: Person_2
Did I miss something? Are we going
into battle?

NAME: Person_1
The last time I was at that place
everybody I was with died.

NAME: Person_1
There's something out there, you
know, something under that sand.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain
artifact, a book, actually, my brother
thinks there's treasure. What do you
think is out there?

NAME: Person_1
Evil. The Tuaregs and the Bedouin
believe that Hamunaptra is cursed,
they call it, "the doorway to hell."

NAME: Person_2
Ahmar is Ossirion. "Passageway to
the underworld", actually.

NAME: Person_2
I don't believe in fairy tales and
hokum, Mister O'Connell, but I do
believe that one of the most famous
books in history is buried out there,
The Book Of The Living. It's what
first interested me in Egypt as a
child. It's why I came here, sort of
a life's pursuit.

NAME: Person_1
And the fact that they say it's made
out of pure gold, makes no nevermind
to you, right?

NAME: Person_2
You know your history.

NAME: Person_1
I know my treasure.

NAME: Person_2
By the way,... why did you kiss me?

NAME: Person_1
I was about to be hanged, seemed
like a good idea at the time.

NAME: Person_1
What?... Wha'd I say?

NAME: Person_4
My very good friend! What a surprise.

NAME: Person_1
Why if it ain't my little buddy,
Beni. I oughta kill you.

NAME: Person_4
You never were any good with the
ladies, O'Connell.

NAME: Person_1
So you're the one leading the
Americans, I shoulda figured. So
what's the scam? You get 'em out in
the middle of the desert then leave
'em to rot?

NAME: Person_4
Unfortunately no, these Americans
are smart, they pay me only half
now, half when I get them back to
Cairo, so I must go all the way.

NAME: Person_4
You never believed in Hamunaptra,
O'Connell. Why are you going back?
The devil himself lives out there.

NAME: Person_1
The girl saved my life, figured it
was the least I could do, keep her
out of trouble.

NAME: Person_4
You always did have more balls than
brains.

NAME: Person_1
Let's make us even, shall we?

NAME: Person_4
Even?

NAME: Person_1
Sounds familiar.

NAME: Side_5
Where is the map?

NAME: Side_5
And the key? Where is the key?

NAME: Side_5
Then I'll find it myself.

NAME: Person_1
Friend of yours?

NAME: Person_2
The map! We need the map!

NAME: Person_1
Relax! I'm the map!
It's all up here.

NAME: Person_2
Oh that's comforting.

NAME: Person_1
C'mon, there's still one more of
those guys around here somewhere.

NAME: Person_3
Hey that's mine --

NAME: Person_1
Can you swim?

NAME: Person_2
Well of course I can swim, if the
occasion calls for it.

NAME: Person_1
Trust me.

NAME: Person_1
The occasion calls for it.

NAME: Person_3
Americans.

NAME: Person_3
I say! Good show!

NAME: Person_3
And did I panic?

NAME: Person_3
I think not.

NAME: Person_4
Hey O'Connell! Looks to me like I
got all the horses!

NAME: Person_1
Hey Beni! Looks to me like your on
the wrong side of the river!

NAME: Person_3
I can't believe the price of these
fleabags.

NAME: Person_1
We coulda had 'em for free, all we
had to do was give 'em your sister.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?

NAME: Person_1
Awfully.

NAME: Person_1
Then again...

NAME: Person_3
Never did like camels. Filthy buggers.
They smell, they bite, they spit.
Disgusting.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, disgusting.

NAME: Person_2
Well I think they're cute.

NAME: Person_3
And you snore!

NAME: Person_8
I do not snore!

NAME: Person_3
All night you snored!

NAME: Person_8
I have never snored!

NAME: Person_1
We're almost there.

NAME: Person_2
Are you sure?

NAME: Person_1
Pretty sure.

NAME: Person_3
What in bloody hell is this?

NAME: Person_8
Other seekers of Hamunaptra.

NAME: Person_4
Good morning, my friend!

NAME: Side_1
Well, what the hell we doin'?

NAME: Person_4
Patience, my good sahib, patience.

NAME: Person_9
First one to the city, O'Connell!
Five hundred! Cash bucks!

NAME: Person_1
Get ready.

NAME: Person_2
For what?

NAME: Person_1
We're about to be shown the way.

NAME: Person_3
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't
we be going?

NAME: Person_2
After all, you rode us night and day
to win that bet.

NAME: Person_4
Fools.

NAME: Person_1
Evelyn! Slow down!

NAME: Person_1
Never mind.

NAME: Person_1
You boys owe me five hundred dollars.

NAME: Side_1
Where'd all these camels come from?

NAME: Person_4
They belong to the dead. They will
wait years for their masters to return
before leaving.

NAME: Person_3
That thing gives me the creeps.

NAME: Person_1
Be nice. That thing saved my life.

NAME: Person_2
That "thing" gets me excited.

NAME: Person_1
The things that get you excited.

NAME: Person_2
According to Bembridge Scholars,
inside the statue of Anubis was a
secret compartment, perhaps containing
The Book Of The Living.

NAME: Person_1
What are those mirrors for?

NAME: Person_2
Ancient Egyptian trick. You'll see.

NAME: Person_2
Do you realize, we are standing inside
a room that no one has entered in
over four thousand years.

NAME: Person_8
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.

NAME: Person_1
You're welcome to my share of the
spider webs.

NAME: Person_3
And it stinks to high heaven in here.

NAME: Person_2
Cretins.

NAME: Side_15
RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's
chamber.

NAME: Person_1
That is a neat trick.

NAME: Person_2
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.

NAME: Person_1
Preparation for what?

NAME: Person_2
For entering the afterlife.

NAME: Person_3
Mummies, my good son, this is where
they made the mummies.

NAME: Person_9
Ya scared the bejeezus out of us,
O'Connell.

NAME: Person_1
Likewise.

NAME: Side_1
This here is our statue,... friend.

NAME: Person_1
Don't see your name on it,... pal.

NAME: Person_4
Ten to one, O'Connell, your odds are
no-so-good.

NAME: Person_1
I've had worse.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, me too.

NAME: Person_2
Let's be nice, children, if we're
going to play together, we must learn
to share.

NAME: Person_2
According to my calculations, we
should be right under the statue.
We'll come up right between his legs.
Oh my.

NAME: Person_3
And when those dirty Yanks go to
sleep --
No offense.

NAME: Person_1
None taken.

NAME: Person_3
We'll sneak up and steal that book
right out from under them.

NAME: Person_1
And you're sure you can find the
secret compartment?

NAME: Person_2
Yes, if their Egyptologist hasn't
already found it.

NAME: Person_3
I say, what's our smelly little friend
got himself up to?

NAME: Side_3
Seti was no fool.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, sure...

NAME: Person_9
We'll let him open it.

NAME: Person_1
Lemme get this straight, they stuck
a sharp, red hot poker up your nose,
cut your brain into small pieces,
then ripped it all out through your
nostrils?

NAME: Person_3
OWCH! That's really got to hurt.

NAME: Person_2
It's called mummification. You're
dead when they do this

NAME: Person_3
Still...

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, that'd bring you back to life.

NAME: Person_2
You two are worse than a couple of
schoolboys.

NAME: Side_16
THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

NAME: Person_2
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks
like a sarcophagus.

NAME: Person_1
Why would they bury somebody in the
ceiling?

NAME: Person_2
They didn't, they buried him at the
foot of Anubis. He was either someone
of great importance. Or he did
something very naughty.

NAME: Person_3
Well?... Who is it?

NAME: Person_2
'He that shall not be named.'

NAME: Person_1
There's some sort of lock here. You
say these thing's are made of granite
with a steel interior?

NAME: Person_2
Quarried granite with a cobalt lining.

NAME: Person_3
Whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting
out.

NAME: Person_1
No kiddin', without a key, it'll
take us a month to crack this thing,

NAME: Person_2
A key! That's it! That's what he was
talking about.

NAME: Person_1
Who was talking about what?

NAME: Person_2
The man on the barge. The one with
the hook, he was looking for a key.

NAME: Person_3
Hey that's mine!

NAME: Person_2
What do you suppose killed him?

NAME: Person_3
Did you ever see him eat?

NAME: Person_1
Seems the Americans had a little
misadventure of their own today,
three of their diggers were killed.

NAME: Person_2
How?

NAME: Person_1
Salt acid. Pressurized salt acid.
Some sort of ancient booby-trap.

NAME: Person_3
Maybe this place really is cursed.

NAME: Person_2
You two!

NAME: Person_1
You don't believe in curses, huh?

NAME: Person_2
No. I believe if I can see it and I
can touch it, then it's real. That's
what I believe.

NAME: Person_1
I believe in being prepared.

NAME: Person_3
Seagrams!

NAME: Person_3
Well, he may have been a stinky
fellow,... but he had good taste.

NAME: Person_1
Stay here!

NAME: Person_3
Evy! Excuse me! But didn't the man
just say -- !

NAME: Person_1
Goin' somewhere?

NAME: Person_4
Just looking for you, O'Connell! I
wanted to be with my friend!

NAME: Person_1
C'mon, friend.

NAME: Person_4
Why do you like to fight so much?

NAME: Person_1
'Cause I look good doin, it.

NAME: Person_3
Let 'em have it, boys!

NAME: Person_3
I say, bloody good show.

NAME: Person_1
You alright?

NAME: Person_2
Yes,... fine,... thank you.

NAME: Side_1
See! That proves it! Old Seti's
fortune's gotta be under this sand!

NAME: Person_9
For them to protect it like this,
you just know there's got to be
treasure down there.

NAME: Person_1
These men are a desert people. They
value water, not gold.

NAME: Person_2
Where's Jonathan?

NAME: Person_2
Unlike my brother, sir, I know when
to say no.

NAME: Person_1
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I
don't get. You're a whole new brew.

NAME: Person_2
I know, you're wondering, what's a
place like me doing in a girl like
this?

NAME: Person_1
Something like that.

NAME: Person_2
Egypt is in my blood. My father was
a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so
much that he married an Egyptian. My
mother! Who was quite an adventurer
herself

NAME: Person_1
Okay, I get your father, I get your
mother and I get your brother, but
what are you doing here?

NAME: Person_2
I may not be an explorer, or an
adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or
a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But
I'm proud of what I am.

NAME: Person_1
And what is that?

NAME: Person_2
...I am a librarian!

NAME: Person_2
I'm going to kiss you, Mister
O'Connell.

NAME: Person_1
No you're not.

NAME: Person_2
I'm not?

NAME: Person_1
Not unless you call me Rick.

NAME: Person_2
Why would I do that?

NAME: Person_1
Because that's my name.

NAME: Person_2
I can't believe I allowed the two of
you to get me drunk.

NAME: Person_3
Don't blame me, I don't even remember
being there.

NAME: Person_2
Well neither do I, thank you.

NAME: Person_1
You don't?

NAME: Person_2
No... Why?... Should I?

NAME: Person_1
Gee, yeah, you told me it was the
best time you ever had.

NAME: Side_3
There is a curse upon this chest.

NAME: Side_1
Curse my ass.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, who cares.

NAME: Side_3
In these hallowed grounds, that which
was set forth in ancient times, is
as strong today, as it was then.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, yeah, okay, what's it --

NAME: Side_3
"Death will come on swift wings to
whomever opens this chest".

NAME: Side_3
It says, there is one, the undead,
who if brought back to life, is bound
by sacred law to consummate this
curse.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, well, let's just make sure we
don't bring anybody back from the
dead then, huh?

NAME: Side_3
He will kill all who open this
chest,... and assimilate their organs
and fluids.

NAME: Side_1
Assimilate their organs and fluids?
Ya mean eat 'em?

NAME: Side_3
And in so doing he will regenerate.
And no longer be the undead, but a
plague upon this earth.

NAME: Person_9
Ah hell, let's open it anyways.

NAME: Person_2
Oh my god, I've dreamed about this
ever since I was a little girl.

NAME: Person_1
You dream about dead guys?

NAME: Person_2
Look, all the sacred spells have
been chiseled off. The hieratics and
hieroglyphs that protect the deceased
on his journey into the afterlife,
they've been removed. This man was
cursed,... doomed.

NAME: Person_1
Tough break.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see
who's inside, shall we?

NAME: Person_4
The curse,... beware the curse!

NAME: Side_1
Stupid superstitious bastard.

NAME: Person_1
Is he supposed to look like that?

NAME: Person_2
No. I've never seen a mummy look
like this. He's, he's still...

NAME: Person_3
Juicy?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. He's more than four thousand
years old and still decomposing.

NAME: Person_1
And look at this.

NAME: Person_2
Oh my god, he was buried alive.

NAME: Person_2
And he left a message.

NAME: Person_2
It says: 'Death is only the
beginning.'

NAME: Person_1
Where's my gun?

NAME: Person_3
What are you going to do? Shoot him?

NAME: Person_1
If he decides to wake up, hell yes!

NAME: Side_3
I have heard told of this book, but
I never truly believed it existed.
This, good gentlemen, is a most
priceless treasure.

NAME: Person_9
I wouldn't trade ya for a brass
spittoon!

NAME: Side_1
Yeah! It's supposed to be made outta
pure gold!

NAME: Person_3
What is this stuff? It smells like
our late friend, the Warden.

NAME: Person_3
You did not!?... We're not!?

NAME: Person_1
Rat gizzards. They smell bad and
taste worse, but that's the best the
desert has to offer.

NAME: Person_9
Say O'Connell, whadaya think these
honey's'll fetch back home?

NAME: Side_4
We hear you gentlemen found yerselves
a nice gooey mummy. Congratulations.

NAME: Side_1
Ya know if ya dry him out, you can
sell him for firewood.

NAME: Person_2
Scarabs, flesh eaters, I found them
inside our friend's coffin. They can
stay alive for years living off the
flesh of a corpse, or in this case...

NAME: Person_2
Famished.

NAME: Person_1
Are you saying somebody threw these
things in with our guy, and they
slowly ate him alive?

NAME: Person_2
Very slowly.

NAME: Person_3
He certainly was not a popular fellow
when they planted him.

NAME: Person_1
Must of got a little too frisky with
the Pharaoh's daughter.

NAME: Person_2
According to my readings, our friend
suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of
all ancient Egyptian curses, one
reserved for only the most evil
blasphemers. In all of my research,
I've never read of this curse actually
having been performed.

NAME: Person_1
That bad huh?

NAME: Person_2
Yes, they never used it because they
feared it so. It's written, that if
a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever
arise, he would bring with him the
ten plagues of Egypt.

NAME: Person_1
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten
plagues.

NAME: Person_4
Like what that Moses guy did to that
Pharaoh guy?

NAME: Person_2
That's one way of putting it.

NAME: Person_3
Let's see, there was frogs, flies,
locusts...

NAME: Side_4
Hail and fire.

NAME: Person_9
The sun turning black.

NAME: Side_1
Water turning to blood.

NAME: Person_3
And my personal favorite: people
covered in boils and sores.

NAME: Person_2
Fried gizzard anyone?

NAME: Person_1
You sure you outta be playin, around
with that?

NAME: Person_2
It's just a book, no harm ever came
from a book.

NAME: Person_2
Ahm kum Ra. Ahm kum Dei.

NAME: Side_3
What have we done?

NAME: Person_3
Did you see that!? Grasshoppers!
Billions of grasshoppers!

NAME: Person_1
That's one of the plagues, right?
The grasshopper plague!

NAME: Person_2
This is not a plague. It's
generational. Every so many years
the locusts of Egypt have a population
explosion and they all take flight.

NAME: Person_1
Okay,... and what about frogs?

NAME: Side_4
Daniels! Henderson!

NAME: Side_4
Daniels?... is that you?

NAME: Side_4
Henderson?

NAME: Person_2
Oh thank goodness, you're one of the
Americans, aren't you?

NAME: Person_6
Anck-su-namun?

NAME: Person_1
Damn-it! Must be a trap door around
here or somethin'.

NAME: Person_2
Help me,... please,... help me.

NAME: Person_6
Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun!

NAME: Person_1
Would you quit playin, around! Let's
get outta here already!

NAME: Person_1
Ahhhhhhhh!!

NAME: Person_7
I told you to leave or die, you
refused, and now you may have killed
us all. For you have unleashed the
creature that we have feared for
more than four thousand years.

NAME: Person_1
Relax, I got him.

NAME: Person_7
No mortal weapons can kill this
creature. He is not of this world.

NAME: Person_1
Are we talkin, about the same
creature? The walking corpse? Really
big mouth? Really bad breath?

NAME: Person_4
May the good Lord protect and watch
over me as a shepherd watches over
his flock. And may Satan in all his
forms be vanquished forever.

NAME: Person_6
The language of the slaves.

NAME: Person_6
I may have use for you. And the
rewards will be great.

NAME: Person_6
Where are the other sacred jars?

NAME: Side_1
You bastards!

NAME: Person_9
What did you do to him!?

NAME: Person_7
We saved him! Saved him before the
creature could finish his work. Now
leave, all of you, quickly, before
he finishes you all.

NAME: Person_3
You're not going to kill us?

NAME: Person_7
We must now hunt him down, and try
and find a way to kill him, before
he consumes the earth. Allah be with
us.

NAME: Person_1
I told ya, I already got him!

NAME: Person_7
Know this, the creature will be coming
for you. He must consummate the curse.
And until he does, he will never
eat, he will never sleep, and he
will never stop.

NAME: Person_1
I thought you didn't believe in this
stuff!?

NAME: Person_2
Having an encounter with a four
thousand year old walking-talking
corpse tends to convert one.

NAME: Person_1
Forget it, we're out the door down
the hall and gone.

NAME: Person_2
No, we are not.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yes we are.

NAME: Person_2
No we are not. We woke him up, and
we must try and stop him.

NAME: Person_1
We?! What we?! You didn't read that
book. I told you not to play around
with that thing.

NAME: Person_2
Alright then, Me, I,... I read the
book, I woke him up and I intend to
stop him.

NAME: Person_1
How!? You heard the man, no mortal
weapons can kill this guy.

NAME: Person_2
Then we'll have to find some immortal
ones.

NAME: Person_1
There goes that belief again. Not
me, I am outta here!

NAME: Person_2
According to that Book, once this
creature has been reborn, his curse
will spread, and as he grows in
strength, so will his curse grow,
infecting the people until the whole
of the earth is destroyed.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah? So? Is that my problem?

NAME: Person_2
It's everybody's problem!

NAME: Person_1
Look lady, I appreciate you saving
my life and all, but when I signed
on, I agreed to take you out there
and bring you back, and I did, now
were even, end of job, end of story,
contract terminated.

NAME: Person_2
That's what I am to you? A contract?

NAME: Person_1
You can either tag along with me, or
you can stay here and play around
with Mister Maggot.

NAME: Person_2
I'm staying.

NAME: Person_1
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did
you slink off to?

NAME: Person_4
You left me! You left me in the desert
to rot.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.
So who's this guy?

NAME: Person_4
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest
of Osiris.

NAME: Person_1
Oh, hey, how ya doin'?

NAME: Person_4
The Prince does not like to be touched
by other humans. A Silly eastern
superstition, I'm afraid.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, well, we all got our little
problems today don't we?

NAME: Person_4
He has come to help Mister Burns.
Somehow I feel responsible.

NAME: Person_1
Don't gimme that, you never had any
scruples.

NAME: Person_4
Do you know where I can steal some?

NAME: Person_1
See ya around, Padre.

NAME: Side_2
I'm the last of the Royal Force still
stationed here, you know? All the
other laddies died in the air and
were buried in the sand.

NAME: Side_2
Ever since the end of the Great War,
there hasn't been a single challenge
worthy of a man like me.

NAME: Person_1
I've heard it before, Winston.

NAME: Side_2
I just wish I would've chucked it
with the other laddies, gone down in
a flame of glory, instead of sitting
around here, rotting from boredom
and booze!

NAME: Side_4
The drawer there, spectacles.
As you see, I won't be needing them.

NAME: Person_4
Mister Burns, Prince Imhotep thanks
you for your spectacles, -- and for
your eyes,... and for your tongue.

NAME: Person_4
But I am afraid more is needed, the
Prince says he must finish the job,
consummate the curse which you and
your friends have brought down upon
yourselves.

NAME: Person_9
Sweet Jesus! That tasted just like,...
like...

NAME: Person_1
Blood.

NAME: Person_3
"And the rivers and waters of Egypt
went red and were as blood."

NAME: Person_1
He's here.

NAME: Person_3
Who's here!?

NAME: Person_1
The guy! The Priest! THE MUMMY!

NAME: Person_1
Evelyn!! EVELYYYYNN!!!

NAME: Person_1
We got problems.

NAME: Person_1
He's here! I saw him! That thing is
here!

NAME: Person_2
The creature!? Are you sure!?

NAME: Person_1
Pretty sure!

NAME: Person_1
We are in serious trouble.

NAME: Person_1
Back off, creep.

NAME: Person_6
You saved me from the undead. For
this, I shall make you immortal.

NAME: Person_9
The curse. The curse.

NAME: Person_2
There's only one person I know who
can possibly give us some answers.

NAME: Person_5
Miss Carnavon. Gentlemen.

NAME: Person_2
What is he doing here?

NAME: Person_5
Do you truly wish to know? Or would
you prefer to just shoot us?

NAME: Person_1
I just saw my fist vanish into some
guy's head.

NAME: Person_1
I'm willin, to go on a little faith,
here.

NAME: Person_5
You will not believe it.

NAME: Person_1
Try me.

NAME: Person_5
We are part of an ancient secret
society, the cult-of-the-Mumia, and
we have a sacred mission, passed
down through thirty-nine generations.
For over four thousand years we have
guarded The City Of The Dead. we are
sworn at manhood to do any and all
in our power to stop the High Priest
Imhotep from being reborn into this
world.

NAME: Person_7
And because of you, we have failed.

NAME: Person_2
And you think this justifies killing
innocent people!?

NAME: Person_5
To have stopped this creature? Yes!

NAME: Person_1
Okay, let's cut to the chase. He's
afraid of cats, what's that about?

NAME: Person_5
According to the ancients, cat's are
the guardians at the gates of the
underworld. Imhotep will fear them
until he is fully regenerated, and
then he will fear nothing.

NAME: Side_1
Right! And ya know how he gets fully
regenerated?! By killing everybody
who opened that chest and sucking us
dry! That's how!

NAME: Person_5
Yes, the creature must first try and
regenerate, and then he will attempt
to resurrect the one he has loved
for more than four thousand years.

NAME: Person_2
Anck-su-namun.

NAME: Person_2
In the necropolis, when I saw him, -
alive,... walking, he called me Anck-
su-namun. And then in Mister Burns'
quarters he tried to kiss me.

NAME: Person_5
It is because it was you who read
from the Book. He has chosen you to
be the human sacrifice needed to
regenerate the body of Anck-su-namun.

NAME: Person_3
This is not good. Not good at all.

NAME: Person_7
Tonight is the full moon. The moon
of Osiris. It will begin tonight.

NAME: Person_3
"...and he stretched forth his hands
towards the heavens, and there was
darkness throughout the land of
Egypt."

NAME: Person_2
We must stop him from regenerating.

NAME: Person_2
Who opened that chest?

NAME: Person_9
Well, there was me and Daniels here
and then poor Burns of course, oh
yeah, and that Egyptologist fella.

NAME: Person_1
What about my buddy, Beni?

NAME: Side_1
Naw, he scrammed outta there,

NAME: Person_2
We must find the Egyptologist and
bring him back here to the safety of
the fort, before the creature can
get to him.

NAME: Person_1
Okay,... Evelyn, you wait here, you
two come with me.

NAME: Person_9
The hell with that! I'm not goin'
nowhere! We're safe here.

NAME: Side_1
Yeah, I'm not leavin, this fort for
nothin'.

NAME: Person_2
Who put you in charge? You can't
just leave me behind like some old
suitcase. I'm the one responsible
for this mess and I intend to be the
one to clean it up.

NAME: Person_1
Keep an eye on her. If you leave her
door, I'll rip your spleen out. C'mon,
Jonathan.

NAME: Person_3
Me?

NAME: Person_1
Lemme guess, spring cleaning?

NAME: Person_1
Where's your new friend?

NAME: Person_4
What friend? You're my only friend.

NAME: Person_1
Then you got no excuse for living.
What the hell you doin, being buddies
with this creep, Beni? What's in it
for you?

NAME: Person_4
It is better to be the right hand of
the Devil,... than in his path. As
long as I serve him, I am immune.

NAME: Person_1
Immune from what?

NAME: Person_4
You shall see.

NAME: Person_1
What are you looking for? Lie, and
I'll slit your throat.

NAME: Person_4
The book! The black book they found
at Hamunaptra! Imhotep wants it back.
Said to me it would be worth it's
weight in diamonds.

NAME: Person_1
What does he want the book for?

NAME: Person_4
Something about bringing his dead
girly-friend back to life. He needs
the book...
And your sister.

NAME: Person_3
That looked rather painful.

NAME: Person_1
Ya know, ever since I met you, my
luck has been for crap.

NAME: Person_3
Yes, I know, I do that to people.

NAME: Person_1
Damn-it! That's two down and only
two to go.

NAME: Person_3
And then he'll be coming after Evy.

NAME: Side_17
Ten o'clock! All is well!

NAME: Side_1
The hell with this. I'm goin,
downstairs to get me a drink. You
want somethin'?

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a
shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.

NAME: Person_1
Get your hands off my girl, pal.

NAME: Person_1
Nice lips.

NAME: Person_1
I figured you might be here, so I
brought a friend.

NAME: Person_2
You called me your girl?

NAME: Person_1
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um,
you know, figure a speech.

NAME: Person_2
I think you were jealous

NAME: Person_1
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see
that guy's face?

NAME: Side_1
Shut-up! JUST SHUT-UP! We gotta do
somethin'! we gotta do somethin,
NOW! Before it's too late!

NAME: Person_2
Last month I came across an
inscription that mentioned The Book
Of The Dead.

NAME: Side_1
That book we found at Hamunaptra?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. I dismissed it, because it talked
about bringing people back from the
dead. A notion I was unwilling to
believe.

NAME: Person_1
Believe it, sister. That's what
brought our buddy back to life.

NAME: Person_3
And now he's going to use it to bring
his girlfriend back

NAME: Person_7
And if he succeeds, the two of them
together will bring about the
apocalypse.

NAME: THE Person_5
The plagues we have seen so far, are
merely Imhotep flexing his muscles.
Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun's
resurrection will he be truly
invincible.

NAME: Person_2
I'm thinking that if the black Book
Of The Dead can bring people back to
life --

NAME: Person_5
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of
The Living can return them to the
underworld.

NAME: Person_2
Exactly --

NAME: Person_1
So your sayin', if we find the book
made outta gold --

NAME: Person_5
-- And read the sacred incantations
contained inside it.

NAME: Person_1
You think it'll send this guy back
to hell?

NAME: Person_5
Correct, And that's when --

NAME: Person_7
It has begun. The beginning of the
end.

NAME: Person_2
Not quite yet it hasn't. C'mon.

NAME: Person_2
Got it!

NAME: Person_1
Got what?

NAME: Person_2
Since the black Book of The Dead was
found inside the statue of Anubis,
then according to this, the golden
Book of The Living should be inside...

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_3
What?

NAME: Person_2
The golden Book Of The Living, is
inside the statue of Horus.

NAME: Person_5
Which would be located not far to
the east of the Anubis statue.

NAME: Person_1
Don't tell me we gotta go back out
there?

NAME: Person_5
If we want to kill the creature,
yes.

NAME: Person_3
Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!

NAME: Person_4
Imhotep! Person_6!

NAME: Person_1
You're gonna get yours, pal!

NAME: Person_1
C'mon! C'mon! Let's go! Let's go!

NAME: Person_2
He's gorgeous.

NAME: THE Person_5
He has consummated the curse, now
all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun
from the dead, then it will be the
end of us, and the beginning for
them.

NAME: Person_6
Koontash dai na.

NAME: Person_4
Take his hand and he will spare the
others.

NAME: Person_2
Any bright ideas?

NAME: Person_1
Sorry, fresh out.

NAME: Person_1
Don't do it, Evelyn.

NAME: Person_2
I have no choice.

NAME: Person_6
Keetah mi pharos, aja nilo, isirlan.

NAME: Person_4
Come with me my princess. It is time
to make you mine, forever.

NAME: Person_2
All eternity, idiot.

NAME: Person_2
You better think of something, because
if he turns me into a mummy, you're
the first one I'm coming after.

NAME: Person_1
Got guts, lady.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I know, and I'd like to keep
them.

NAME: Person_3
Hey that's mine -- !

NAME: Person_1
Evelyn!

NAME: Person_7
Be calm. There is still time. We can
stop him yet.

NAME: Person_6
Pared oos.

NAME: Person_4
Kill them.

NAME: Person_5
Go! Find a way! Kill the creature!

NAME: Person_1
We gotta get her back.

NAME: Person_3
I'm with you, old man. No one touches
my sister like that and gets away
with it.

NAME: Person_1
You know where he's taking her?

NAME: Person_7
Yes. To Hamunaptra. To perform the
ritual.

NAME: Person_3
And what ritual would that be?

NAME: Person_7
The ritual to bring the body of Anck-
su-namun back to life.

NAME: Person_3
And how does one do that?

NAME: Person_7
By reading the Book Of The Dead.

NAME: Person_3
Oh yes, of course.

NAME: Person_7
And then killing your sister.

NAME: Person_3
Excuse me?

NAME: Person_7
Imhotep is now able to cross the
desert with great haste.

NAME: Person_3
Begging your pardon, but I wasn't
quite clear on that last part.

NAME: Person_7
If he arrives before us, it will be
too late.

NAME: Person_3
Did you say 'kill' my sister?

NAME: Person_1
I know how to beat him to it.

NAME: Side_2
So what's your little problem got to
do with His Majesty's Royal Air Corp?

NAME: Person_1
Not a god-damned thing.

NAME: Side_2
Is it dangerous?

NAME: Person_1
You probably won't live through it.

NAME: Side_2
By Jove, do you really think so?

NAME: Person_3
Everybody else we've bumped into has
died, why not you?

NAME: Side_2
So what's the challenge then?

NAME: Person_1
To save the damsel in distress, kill
the bad guy and steal his treasure.

NAME: Side_2
Winston Havlock at your service,
sir!

NAME: Person_2
What just happened?

NAME: Person_4
All I remember is him turning into a
blast of sand,... and then I remember
nothing.

NAME: Side_2
Hang on, men!

NAME: Side_2
We're going down!

NAME: Side_2
Here I come, laddies!

NAME: Person_2
Stop it! You'll kill them!

NAME: Person_3
Excuse me... A little help would be
useful... IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH

NAME: Person_1
Okay, now what the hell does this
Horus guy look like?

NAME: Person_3
He's a big fellow with pointy ears
and a face like a falcon.

NAME: Person_1
Got it.

NAME: Person_4
Keep moving.

NAME: Person_2
You know, nasty little fellows such
as yourself, always get their
comeuppance.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah?

NAME: Person_2
Oh yes, always.

NAME: Person_3
I say, look at that.

NAME: Person_3
Say, gents! You should come have a
look at this.

NAME: Person_1
From now on, don't touch anything.
Not a damn thing. Keep your hands
off the furniture, got it?

NAME: Person_4
Prince Imhotep wants your heart.

NAME: Person_2
Tell him, I'm truly flattered... but
that it's already taken.

NAME: Person_4
He wants your heart and your brain,
your liver, your kidneys...

NAME: Person_4
...and how do you say? Those slimy
things, in your stomach?

NAME: Person_2
Intestines.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah! Them.

NAME: Person_2
You only want me for my organs?!

NAME: Person_1
Who the hell are these guys?

NAME: Person_7
Priests. Imhotep's priests.

NAME: Person_1
I never killed a priest before.

NAME: Person_7
They are evil, cursed, they matter
not.

NAME: Person_1
Well, okay then.

NAME: Person_1
Oh come on, gimme a break here.

NAME: Person_6
(ancient Egyptian --
subtitled)
Kill them! Kill them all! And bring
me the Book Of The Living!

NAME: Person_7
My turn.

NAME: Person_1
This whole place is comin, alive!

NAME: Person_7
I'm out.

NAME: Person_3
There he is!

NAME: Person_3
Hello Horus old boy.

NAME: Person_7
Allow me.

NAME: Person_1
These guys just don't quit.

NAME: Person_7
Keep digging!

NAME: Side_18
THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in
the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

NAME: Person_7
Save the girl! Kill the creature!

NAME: Person_1
That's the last one, we better get
lucky.

NAME: Person_6
With your death, my love and I will
be invincible!

NAME: Person_3
I found it, Evy! I found it

NAME: Person_2
Shut-up and get me off of here!

NAME: Person_2
Open the book, Jonathan! Open the
book! That's the only way to kill
him!

NAME: Person_3
I can't open it! It's locked or
something!

NAME: Person_3
We need the key!

NAME: Person_3
What do I do, Evy!? What do I do!?

NAME: Person_2
Read the inscription on the cover!

NAME: Person_3
Keetash-something, naraba-something.

NAME: Person_3
Ebarra im hatu Kashka ummmmm -- ?

NAME: Person_3
Rasheem Aaaaa ANUBIS!

NAME: Person_3
Oh boy.

NAME: Person_1
This just keeps gettin, better and
better.

NAME: Person_1
Do something, Jonathan! Kill it!

NAME: Person_3
You have got to be joking?

NAME: Person_2
Finish the inscription, idiot!

NAME: Person_3
Oh.

NAME: Person_3
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now
what is this last symbol here?

NAME: Person_2
What's it look like!?

NAME: Person_3
It's an Anck symbol, with two little
squiggly lines above it, and a bird,
a stork! on either side.

NAME: Person_2
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!

NAME: Person_3
Yes,... I see.

NAME: Person_3
Hootash im Ahmenophus!

NAME: Person_1
Okay pal, let's see how tough you
are without your right arm.

NAME: Person_1
Alright,... so he's left handed.

NAME: Person_3
I got it!

NAME: Person_2
Kadeesh mal! Kadeesh mal! Pared oos!

NAME: Person_2
Death is only the beginning.

NAME: Person_1
C'mon!

NAME: Person_4
Go away.

NAME: Person_3
Well,... I guess we go home empty
handed.

NAME: Person_1
Wouldn't say that.

NAME: Person_5
There's no bad crowds dude. Only bad
comedians.

NAME: Person_1
You complain about the crowd like all
the time.

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, but that's when they're really bad.

NAME: Person_1
So like ninety percent of the time,
they're really bad?

NAME: Person_5
Will you just watch and give me notes
tonight? If we both give each other
notes, I think it would be helpful.

NAME: Person_1
Your notes are just to add more "fucks"
into the bit.

NAME: Person_5
Fuck's a funny word. Soft on the top and
it's hard on the end.

NAME: Side_1
That was truly horrible.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, that was great.

NAME: Side_1
No, he didn't even crack a smile. I
thought I was gonna puke.

NAME: Person_5
Who?

NAME: Side_1
Bob Dalavan.

NAME: Person_5
Who's Bob Dalaban?

NAME: Person_6
Bob Dalavan - works for the Montreal
Comedy Festival, you fuckin' doof.
Don't you want to get noticed? Move to
LA? Hang out with Elijah Wood and shit.

NAME: Side_8
No one's on stage?

NAME: Side_1
No!

NAME: Person_1
He might have been doing cocaine.

NAME: Person_6
Was he doing cocaine recreationally?

NAME: Side_1
A true cokehead.

NAME: Person_5
Confidence. Poise. Smile.

NAME: Person_1
He's like if a serial killer fucked an
inspirational speaker.

NAME: Person_6
He's like Daniel Day Lewis except he
sucks.

NAME: Person_5
Just bought a laser printer. Printed
out like six lasers so far.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Dodd. Dalavan's in the crowd
tonight. Could I do ten?

NAME: Side_8
No. Five minutes. You put out chairs,
you get five minutes. You know the
deal.

NAME: Person_1
C'mon man. I'll double it up next time.

NAME: Side_8
No.

NAME: Person_1
What are you gonna do in there?

NAME: Side_8
I'm making up next week's schedule.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. Cool.

NAME: Person_6
I was in bed with my girlfriend and I was
trying to mansplain to her that, you
know, we are on one little rock orbiting
a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
a universe full of a billion galaxies, so
I forgot your birthday. Who gives a shit?
You are cosmically over reacting to this.
Honestly you are being super selfish.
You're right, but you're selfish.

NAME: Person_1
Hey! Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? I saw these news
reports so I looked up what cheese is and
cheese is a mixture. Cheese is Tylenol PM
and heroin. So really, it's heroin.
Heroin's doing the heavy lifting. Just do
the heroin, it's very powerful. You
already have heroin.

NAME: Person_1
Is Pakistan in the house?!

NAME: Person_1
You're not from Pakistan. I would have
noticed you.

NAME: Person_5
He just gave you Montreal? Like you
don't have to showcase or audition or
anything?

NAME: Person_6
It was too easy. Like I wanted to
struggle. I wanted a story to be able
to tell on talk shows and instead,
like, you guys don't know how hard it
is not to struggle. It's a struggle
succeeding effortlessly.

NAME: Side_1
Did he say anything about me?

NAME: Person_6
Sure.

NAME: Person_5
What about me?

NAME: Person_6
Both of you. He said, those guys
performed...

NAME: Side_1
I truly hate you, actually.

NAME: Person_5
We all hate you.

NAME: Person_1
Hi.

NAME: Person_2
Hi.

NAME: Person_1
Um, my name is Kumail.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. We know.

NAME: Side_13
We saw you perform.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Now that the niceties are out of
the way, I have to tell you that when
you yelled at me, it threw me off. You
really shouldn't heckle comedians. It's
so rude.

NAME: Person_2
I didn't heckle you. I just woo-hooed
you. It was supportive.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, that's a common misconception.
Yelling anything at a comedian is
considered heckling. Heckling doesn't
have to be negative.

NAME: Person_2
So if I yelled out "You're amazing in
bed," that would be a heckle?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. It'd be an accurate heckle.

NAME: Side_13
Wow. Goodbye!

NAME: Person_2
Don't go! You scared my friend off now.

NAME: Person_1
What's your name?

NAME: Person_2
Emily.

NAME: Person_1
I want to show you something, Emily.
This is your name in Urdu.

NAME: Person_2
Whoa. Does this move work?

NAME: Person_1
I've had some minor success with it.

NAME: Person_2
Bullshit.

NAME: Person_1
So you came to a comedy show with your
friends?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, we're all grad students at U of

NAME: Person_1
What are you studying at grad school?

NAME: Person_2
I study psychology. I'm going to be a
therapist.

NAME: Person_1
Oh so you're gonna sit on a couch and
ask people, "how did that make you
feel?"

NAME: Person_2
Eventually. Right now I'm doing field
work with a group of guys convicted of
domestic violence.

NAME: Person_1
Jesus.

NAME: Person_2
Cheers to that.

NAME: Person_1
Oh wow. No, don't cheers to that. To
you becoming a therapist.

NAME: Person_2
Great. To me getting my masters. We'll
start there and then we'll go to the
rest of it.

NAME: Person_1
So my roommate Chris is probably on the
couch. He's going to try and start a
conversation. So no matter what- do not
engage. Okay? Let's go.

NAME: Person_5
Hi!

NAME: Person_5
Good for him.

NAME: Person_1
Do you want to watch a movie?

NAME: Person_2
Sure. Should I just, put my stuff down?
Or...

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I would say it's safe. You know
what, go for that area. I cleaned that
earlier this year.

NAME: Person_2
Should I take my shoes off or is this a
shoes on bed?

NAME: Person_1
No, it's a shoes off bed. I have strict
rules.

NAME: Person_2
Oh wow. That's totally an inflated
mattress.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Did you think it would be a flat
inflatable mattress?

NAME: Person_2
I did think it might be an actual
mattress.

NAME: Person_1
Well air mattresses are actual
mattresses. You're being bigoted towards
air based comfort items.

NAME: Person_1
Night of The Living Dead?

NAME: Person_2
Sure, I haven't ever seen that movie.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, so basically the dead start rising.
And the good guys, um...

NAME: Person_5
Text Lauren. You up girl?

NAME: Side_15
What do you want to say to Warren?

NAME: Person_5
Ah, no. Fuck.

NAME: Side_15
What do you want to say to-

NAME: Person_5
You up? Period. Send.

NAME: Side_15
That may be beyond my abilities at the
moment.

NAME: Person_5
Fuck.

NAME: Person_2
What are these scars?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, they're a smallpox vaccination.

NAME: Person_2
I thought only old people had those.

NAME: Person_1
Well I'm from Pakistan. We're still
fighting some battles you guys have
already won.

NAME: Person_2
What were you like in high school? Were
you like, super funny? Were you really
smart?

NAME: Person_1
I was very shy. They called me
chashmullee.

NAME: Person_2
What is that?

NAME: Person_1
It roughly translates to "dweeb." I'll
show you a picture.

NAME: Person_2
Of you in high school? Oh my god!

NAME: Person_1
Boom.

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_1
And I'm thinking I'm killing it right
now.

NAME: Person_2
What inspired this hair cut?

NAME: Person_1
Hugh Grant.

NAME: Person_2
Oh no. And you're so serious.

NAME: Person_1
I read in an interview with Hugh Grant,
he said he doesn't smile because it
makes his face look fat. So I didn't
smile in pictures for many years. What
were you like in high school? Were you
voted... Most Sexy?

NAME: Person_2
No. I was voted "Most Noticeable."

NAME: Person_1
That's good.

NAME: Person_2
No. It's really not good. I had acne,
and I was a Goth and I had this
terrible perm. The kids called me
Beetlejuice. I don't know why. Actually
I do know why, it's because they
thought I looked like Beetlejuice. I
think I'm done with this subject. In
fact, I think I'm gonna go home.

NAME: Person_1
Wait we haven't even had sex again yet.

NAME: Person_2
No. No. I'm really not that kind of
girl. I only have sex once on a first
date. Plus a hand job.

NAME: Person_1
Well I haven't had that yet!

NAME: Person_2
You don't get that because you made fun
of me.

NAME: Person_1
What is happening right now? What are you
doing?

NAME: Person_2
I'm changing under this blanket.

NAME: Person_1
I've seen everything. Do you remember, we
were just having sex?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, but you were in the throes of
passion then. Listen, I had a really nice
time. Thank you very much. I'm just gonna
call an Uber and go home.

NAME: Person_1
Your driver will be ready as soon as he
puts on his pants.

NAME: Person_2
Were you available for rides while we
were fucking?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, but I only looked a couple of
times.

NAME: Person_1
So. Maybe I'll run into you at the club
sometime and we can grab a drink?

NAME: Person_2
I'm not really - I know this sounds
like a line - but I'm not really dating
right now. I have a lot of school and
work and just a lot on my plate.

NAME: Person_1
That's perfect because I'm not really
dating right now either. I actually
have a pretty strict two-day rule where
I can't see someone more than two days
in a row. So since we hung out for two
days, if I were to see you again, which
I won't because you're not dating, I'm
not dating, I wouldn't be able to see
you until Monday.

NAME: Person_2
We haven't hung out for two days. We've
hung out for about five hours. Just to
like, be totally clear.

NAME: Person_1
Yesterday and today. Cause it's after
midnight, today is actually tomorrow.
Earlier tonight was yesterday. So two
days.

NAME: Person_2
You see, I don't date time nerds, so that
really takes you off the table.

NAME: Person_1
That works out, because I am a hard
core time nerd.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, I can tell.

NAME: Person_1
I'm like, very strict about AM/PM
stuff.

NAME: Person_2
So wait, just to establish, what did we
just decide?

NAME: Person_1
We decided we aren't ever going to see
each other again.

NAME: Person_2
Great. I'm glad we're on the same page.

NAME: Person_1
I don't want to touch your jeans.

NAME: Person_9
They're like sweatpants. You should be
stylish like your father. It's not very
difficult. Just observe me.

NAME: Person_8
Get some Daddy Style.

NAME: Person_7
Kumi, why don't you grow a beard? Not
like Naveed's, just a small one.

NAME: Person_9
Maybe like mine, small and stylish.

NAME: Person_7
Kumi, I've been thinking, you know, why
you don't enroll for LSAT now?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah sorry, Ma. I haven't done it yet.
I like that you bring it up as though
you've never brought it up before.

NAME: Person_8
How's the stand-up coming Bhai?

NAME: Person_1
It's going fine.

NAME: Person_7
Since when are you someone to stand-up?
You know who I think should stand up is
Malala. She has something to say.

NAME: Person_8
Ma-la-la.

NAME: Person_1
She does open mics and she crushes. Lot
of ethnic material, which I think is a
crutch, and that one story gets a lot of
play, but -

NAME: Side_14
You should be on that show Saturday Night
Live!

NAME: Person_1
That's a great idea. I should e-mail
them, I don't know why I hadn't thought
of that.

NAME: Person_9
You know, I hacked into your Cousin
Rehan's Facebook account-

NAME: Person_1
You hacked into it?

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, they were not accepting my friend
request so I had to hack into it and I
discovered he and that white woman he is
living with are having a baby -

NAME: Person_1
They're married.

NAME: Person_9
Yeah, whatever. And then I hacked into
Tumblr and I discovered that they named
him Dav. Can you imagine?

NAME: Person_1
Dave. It's probably Dave.

NAME: Side_20
Ah, Dave. Yes, Dave.

NAME: Person_7
Very, very, very sad. No one is going to
visit that baby. That baby, mark my
words, will grow up without a family.

NAME: Side_14
It's like he's dead. Or worse.

NAME: Person_7
It's very sad. Kumi, go pray now so we
can eat ice cream. Go! The ja-namaz is
downstairs.

NAME: Person_8
Hurry up yaar. Ice cream.

NAME: Person_9
My mother used to make best kulfi. Your
grandmother.

NAME: Person_1
I think ice cream is better than kulfi.

NAME: Person_9
No, no-

NAME: Person_7
Oh. I wonder who that could be?

NAME: Person_1
I'm guessing it's a young, single
Pakistani woman who just happened to be
driving by our house, which is in a cul-
de-sac and I'm also guessing that the
phrase "dropped in" will be said in the
next ten seconds.

NAME: Person_9/Person_8/Side_14
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven -

NAME: Person_7
Everyone. This is Zubeida. She just
dropped in.

NAME: Side_16
Salaam.

NAME: Side_20
Wa alaikum salaam.

NAME: Person_7
Please, sit.

NAME: Side_16
Here, Kumail. For your files. Your X-
Files. Because that's your favorite
show, huh?

NAME: Person_1
Thank you so much.

NAME: Side_16
The truth is out there!

NAME: Person_1
It's from the show. Thank you.

NAME: Person_7
I hope you come back.

NAME: Person_7
Kumi, there's not going to be a magic
spark, okay? You have to work at it. You
have to stay open.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, Ma, yeah. I just wish you were
better at it, you know?

NAME: Person_1
I mean you've had so much practice and
you're still not that good at it!

NAME: Person_7
Ha. Ha. Ha.

NAME: Person_1
You brought your A-game with Naveed, but
then with me, you're kind of just phoning
it in a little bit.

NAME: Side_23
Again with the comedy, the comedy. All
the time with the comedy. Be serious!

NAME: Person_1
I am serious! That's why I want to help
you get better!

NAME: Person_2
So, are you ever going to let me sit in
the front seat?

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm a professional. And you're paying
for this ride.

NAME: Person_2
I don't want to pay for this ride! It's
surging right now.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, sorry. You shouldn't have typed in
the number.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. The year is 1969. MGM has had a
string of failures. So, it turns to its
most bankable star, Vincent Price.

NAME: Person_2
Is this your compatibility test? Like,
the way people are with Vonnegut or The
Big Lebowski?

NAME: Person_1
No! Just watch the movie. And take it
seriously.

NAME: Person_2
I'm going to love it. I love it when men
test me on my taste.

NAME: Person_1
I just want to share this movie with you,
so I don't know why you're reading into-

NAME: Person_2
How many women have you shown this movie
to?

NAME: Person_1
Zero.

NAME: Person_2
How many women have you shown a B Horror
movie to on like, a third date.

NAME: Person_1
This is not a B horror movie.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, you ready? Just close your eyes
cause when the menu comes up, there's
some spoilers in the menu.

NAME: Person_2
I'm ready, I'm ready!

NAME: Person_1
Ok, I'll hit play.

NAME: Person_1
Watch!

NAME: Person_2
I'm watching!

NAME: Person_1
Shhhhhh! Watch this part.

NAME: Person_2
Stop watching me!

NAME: Person_1
No! Are you tired? We can watch it later.

NAME: Person_2
I just have that weird yawning thing that
happens, when you're watching a really
boring film.

NAME: Person_1
It's not boring! Wait for it to kick in.
The plot kicks in really soon.

NAME: Person_2
That was fun. Thanks for the ride home,
but we gotta stop doing this.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_2
I know I've said that before, but I
really do mean it. I can't be doing this
right now.

NAME: Person_1
I know. Totally. One hundred percent. I
agree with you.

NAME: Person_2
So don't call me again.

NAME: Person_1
I won't. I promise.

NAME: Person_2
Good luck on all your future endeavors.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah, thank you. Hey, can we have an
awkward hug before we part forever?

NAME: Person_2
Ok.

NAME: Person_1
Ok.

NAME: Person_2
Goodbye.

NAME: Person_1
Goodbye.

NAME: Person_2
You just promised never to call me
again.

NAME: Person_1
It's really cold out here. It's so
cold.

NAME: Person_2
You make a pretty good point.

NAME: Person_2
It's a lot warmer in here.

NAME: Person_1
It is warmer in here.

NAME: Person_2
You know, it's really nice upstairs.

NAME: Person_1
Is it?

NAME: Person_6
Emily, has Kumail told you that in
addition to being an Uber driver he
also has a one-man show?

NAME: Person_2
No, he did not tell me that.   Do you
really?

NAME: Person_1
It's really nothing. It's just
something I'm fiddling around with.

NAME: Person_2
How is a one man show different from
stand-up?

NAME: Person_1
It's really not.

NAME: Side_1
There's lots of wigs and costume
changes.

NAME: Person_6
There's a lot of acting in it.

NAME: Side_1
And then like at the end of it, you've
got this very awkward conversation where
you go, "I really liked it."

NAME: Person_1
But I thought you really liked it!

NAME: Side_1
I really liked it.

NAME: Person_2
I can't wait to see the show.

NAME: Person_1
You will never see the show...

NAME: Person_6
You have to see the show.

NAME: Side_1
You have to see it.

NAME: Person_1
It's not ready.

NAME: Person_6
You will love the acting.

NAME: Person_1
They're fucking with you.   It's not
really like that.

NAME: Person_2
Are they fucking with me or you? It
seems like they're fucking with you.

NAME: Person_1
I'm twelve years old. This...this is
home. Feels like I never left. Do you
smell that? That's my mom cooking the
Murgh Roghen Joash.

NAME: Person_6
Fuck.

NAME: Person_1
Do you hear that? That's my father
watching cricket on the telly. Do you
feel that? That's the weight of
Pakistan's history.

NAME: Person_1
Pakistan was formed when it separated
from its biggest rival, India, on
August 14th 1947.

NAME: Person_1
Six runs!

NAME: Person_1
Silly Mid On, Short Mid Wicket,
Midwicket, Deep Mid Wicket, Mid On, Long
On, Long Off...

NAME: Side_13
I have to leave as soon as the show's
over. I can't stay.

NAME: Person_1
So if you get a Silly Mid On fielder, you
know you're getting a Yorker soon.

NAME: Person_1
So to review, Pakistan's biggest exports
are cotton and...

NAME: Side_17
Concrete.

NAME: Person_6
Kill me.

NAME: Person_1
Eid Mubarak. That's our Christmas.
Except instead of the traditional
Christmas ham, we serve Mitthai, which
my khansama Chris will serve to you
right now. Khansama is Urdu for
servant.

NAME: Person_1
If you'd like to make it at home, the
main ingredients are condensed milk,
sugar, and love. At least, that was my
mom's recipe.

NAME: Person_6
Hey, you look like a children's toy from
Malaysia.

NAME: Person_1
Now all rise for the Pakistani national
anthem.

NAME: Person_2
Hey!

NAME: Person_1
Hey!    So? What did you think?

NAME: Person_2
Um, I thought it was great.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah?

NAME: Person_2
I never knew that Pakistan had the
world's largest irrigation system.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Something like 14 million
hectares are being irrigated. As soon
as I read that I was like "oh, that's
going in the show."

NAME: Person_6
Hey, that was... You were in the zone,
man. That was the best one we've seen.

NAME: Side_1
Yeah, that was so honest and good.

NAME: Person_6
And you know what I realized halfway
through? You're from Pakistan! Good to
see you Emily!

NAME: Person_2
Bye guys!

NAME: Person_6
Keep up the-

NAME: Person_1
They seem to like it.

NAME: Person_2
They're so nice.

NAME: Person_1
So, really what did you think?   You know,
it's a work in progress...

NAME: Person_2
I really liked it. I learned a lot.
About Pakistan, and cricket. All those
positions. But I just wish that I
learned more about you. Does that make
any sense?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Hey.

NAME: Person_2
Oh, hi!

NAME: Person_1
It's 3 AM.

NAME: Person_2
Is that diner around the corner open?

NAME: Person_1
It's 24 hours. Why?   You want an old
lemon meringue pie?

NAME: Person_2
You're so funny! Actually, no, I
just...I really need to get a cup of
coffee.

NAME: Person_1
I can make you coffee.

NAME: Person_2
I love diner coffee.     That burnt taste.

NAME: Person_1
All right, I'll come with you.

NAME: Person_2
No, no! Why would you do that?

NAME: Person_1
It's a bad neighborhood. I'm not gonna
let you go on your own.

NAME: Person_2
Why cause I'm a woman? Seriously, that's
the most misogynist thing I've ever
heard.

NAME: Person_1
Why are you being so weird?

NAME: Person_2
Fuck you, I'm not being weird.

NAME: Person_1
You're being so weird.

NAME: Person_2
Fuck you. You're being weird!    You're
being so weird!

NAME: Person_1
How am I weird? I want to sleep while
it's sleep time.

NAME: Person_2
This is normal. Girls go to get coffee
in the middle of the night. Have you
never had a girlfriend before? This is
what it's like.

NAME: Person_1
Are you okay?

NAME: Person_2
Everything is not okay. Everything is
not okay.

NAME: Person_1
You can tell me anything, you know that
right? You can tell me anything.

NAME: Person_2
I have to take a shit, okay? I have to
take a huge fucking dookie. I can't
take a poo in your bathroom because you
don't have any matches and you don't
have any air freshener. What kind of
person doesn't have any matches or air
freshener in the bathroom? The walls
are so thin! And Chris is right out
there.

NAME: Person_2
Please stop laughing! Please, please.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, I have an idea.

NAME: Person_1
How are you?

NAME: Person_2
I do not want to talk about it.

NAME: Person_8
Watch and learn, Bhai. It's all about
shifting weight and torque.

NAME: Person_8
Oh Christ!

NAME: Person_1
Oh.

NAME: Person_1
You're like a Pakistani Sammy Sosa.

NAME: Person_1
Hey he's pretty good. Just do what
he's doing.

NAME: Person_8
Mine.

NAME: Person_1
Come on.

NAME: Person_8
Mine, mine.

NAME: Person_1
These cookies are really good.

NAME: Person_8
They're biscuits! Listen to yourself.
You hardly sound Pakistani. "Cookies"?
You sound like Julia Louis-Dreyfus.
You're such a burger.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not a burger.

NAME: Person_8
Yes, you are. You're a big fat burger.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not a burger and biscuit is actually
a British term.

NAME: Person_8
Well thank you for that information
that no one gives a shit about and you
should listen to mom and grow a beard.

NAME: Person_1
It gets really itchy, I've tried. It's
all patchy.

NAME: Person_8
Try being a man and conditioning like I
do.

NAME: Person_1
What's the whole thing with Muslims
growing beards anyway? It's such an
arbitrary thing. Like who decided that?
Oh, we have to have beards.

NAME: Person_8
Yeah. There are a billion of us and you
are the only one with the truth. Is
that right? The sun is just shining
down on you right now. It's just
parting like "ahh".

NAME: Person_1
You know, I have to tell you something,
Bhai.

NAME: Person_8
Here we go. Yeah?

NAME: Person_1
I've been dating this girl.

NAME: Person_8
Acha.

NAME: Person_8
I thought you were going to say you were
involved in a hit and run or you got
caught forging some checks. But a WHITE
GIRL? Such a cliche.

NAME: Person_1
It's okay! We hate terrorists!

NAME: Person_8
Listen. I understand. You're in
America. You wanna mow a few lawns and
see what it's like. But eventually you
have to marry a Pakistani girl. Like I
hung out with other girls. But then I
married Fatima. We hardly spoke two
words to each other the first few
months! But now, Kumi, she's like my
best friend. You have to break up with
her immediately.

NAME: Person_1
If I find someone who's as good for me
as Fatima is for you, Mom would
understand, right? I mean, she wouldn't
love me less?

NAME: Person_8
She would definitely love you less.
Slowly, you'd sort of -- what's the
word when guys stop returning girls'
calls?

NAME: Person_1
Ghosting?

NAME: Person_8
Yes.
You have to end it now or Mom will
fucking ghost you.

NAME: Person_8
Now come on.

NAME: Person_2
I'm getting a lot of bright fruit. I'd
say it's very fruit forward.

NAME: Person_1
Uh huh. It tastes like grape juice
that's gone bad. How do you know so
much about wine?

NAME: Person_2
Um, because, I was pretty unhappy in my
first marriage and I drank a lot and
one way to cover drinking is to know a
lot about wine.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry wait, what did you say?

NAME: Person_2
That knowing a lot about wine sort of
covers for drinking a lot.

NAME: Person_1
No, the huge piece of information
you're trying to blow right past.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah. I was married.

NAME: Person_1
You were married?

NAME: Person_2
I was. I was married. Do you want to
talk about something else?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, cause I don't really have any
questions other than...when did you get
married? When did you get divorced?
What's his name? How tall is he? Did
you love him? I guess I have a couple
of questions.

NAME: Person_2
NAME: Side_24
Uh huh. His name was, is Ryan. We met in
college. Everyone I knew was getting
married super young, so we did. And one
day I was at a restaurant and I saw
this couple making out and I thought "I
don't think about my husband like that,
but I guess that's okay" and then
another part of my brain was like "NO
feel like this is freaking you out.
Does this freak you out?

NAME: Person_1
It's not freaking me out.

NAME: Person_2
I don't wanna put pressure on you. And I
know it's only been a few months.

NAME: Person_2
But I just wanted to tell you that I am
completely overwhelmed by you. It's the
last thing I was expecting.

NAME: Person_1
This is also the last thing I was
expecting and I also feel completely
overwhelmed by you.

NAME: Person_2
That's a weird thing to say.

NAME: Person_1
Why? I just said what you said. Exactly
what you said.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, but it wasn't weird when I said
it.   It's okay.

NAME: Person_2
So listen, my parents are coming to
town this weekend. Maybe you wanna come
for lunch?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, we can't because of the two-day rule,
right? You'll come to Mary's party
Friday night and then you'll probably
spend the night. So I won't be able to
see you until Monday, so...

NAME: Person_2
Okay. Well, I would love to meet your
parents. They live in the city, right?

NAME: Person_1
Well, they live in the suburbs. You
know, I don't really see them very
much.

NAME: Person_2
Have they asked about me? What do they
think? Do they want to meet me? My
parents want to meet you.

NAME: Person_1
Of course, of course. They're dying to
meet you.

NAME: Person_2
Ow... oh my god..

NAME: Person_1
Are you okay? What happened?

NAME: Person_2
Totally fine.

NAME: Person_1
Do you need assistance?

NAME: Person_2
I think I just tweaked my ankle. I took
this stupid hip hop dance class last
weekend.

NAME: Person_1
You should get it looked at. Do you want
ice?

NAME: Person_2
Look, I'm walking on it. I'm totally
fine.

NAME: Person_1
Can I get you a bag of ice? I can carry
you? I can carry you the rest of the day?

NAME: Person_2
Kumail, seriously, stop.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, I liked your friends.     That Craig
guy or was it Greg?

NAME: Person_1
I can never tell with those names. I'm
glad I like him cause I don't want to
have to come up with excuses to avoid
him, you know. Like, oh no, I have
kite surfing tonight.

NAME: Person_1 (O.S.)
Did you know in the UK it's pronounced
"Crayg". Which is good because that's
actually how it's written, right? He's
a "Crate" guy.

NAME: Person_1
I was going to tell you about that.

NAME: Person_2
Are you like judging Pakistan's Next
Top Model or something? Seriously, who
are these women?

NAME: Person_1
You know how we have arranged marriage
in my culture? These are those women.

NAME: Person_2
These are women in Pakistan who want to
marry you?

NAME: Person_1
They're not in Pakistan.

NAME: Person_2
You've met these women?

NAME: Person_1
Just with my parents. We haven't like -

NAME: Person_2
You're not serious about this, are you?

NAME: Person_1
It's my mom's thing, I just go along with
it.

NAME: Person_2
So what does your mom think about you and
me, then?

NAME: Person_2
She doesn't know about me, does she?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Person_2
Fucking five months   of red flags. Oh my
god, I'm so stupid.   You ducking my
parents. Oh my god,   the two day rule!
Seriously, red flag   after red flag.
Such a liar!

NAME: Person_2
You lie to me. You lie to your parents.
And those are just the people you like!
Is there someone that you're not lying
to? I'd love to meet them, cause then I
could tell them what a fucking liar you
are!

NAME: Person_1
You didn't tell me about your being
divorced until recently. You were
hiding fucking something too!

NAME: Person_2
My divorce does not mean our future is
impossible. It actually means the
direct opposite. I'm not hiding
anything from you. Okay? I'm an open
fucking book. You wanna know what's in
my cigar box? Stickers. Stickers and
stamps.

NAME: Person_1
Aren't you a therapist? Aren't you
supposed to be good at handling these
types of things.

NAME: Person_2
Where are my fucking shoes?

NAME: Person_1
Aren't you supposed to be handling this
better than you are right now?

NAME: Person_2
I'm expressing myself!

NAME: Person_1
You know what we call "arranged
marriage" in my culture, Emily?
Marriage! Okay? We just call it
marriage. There's another type of
marriage that's called "love marriage"
and that's bad. My cousin Rehan married
an Irish woman and he was kicked out of
the family! And nobody is allowed to
talk to him.

NAME: Person_2
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

NAME: Person_1
Because I didn't think you'd fucking
understand and I was fucking right!

NAME: Person_2
You don't think I could fathom your life
in any fucking way?

NAME: Person_1
I'm fighting a fourteen hundred year
old culture! You were ugly in high
school! There's a big fucking
difference!
I'm sorry. I can't lose my family.

NAME: Person_2
Can you imagine a world where we end up
together?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know.

NAME: Person_2
I have to go. Don't fucking call me.

NAME: Side_26
Multi-grain, pumpernickel, pita bread,
hot dog buns, croutons..I can't eat any
of it.

NAME: Side_5
I don't want kids. People say, Sam,
you're gonna love it. You're gonna have a
kid and he's gonna be your best friend.
A best friend that pukes on you and shits
everywhere, and is constantly screaming.
I already have friends like that. People
say, Sam...

NAME: Person_6
I know you're bummed. Look, Emily's a
good person, I'm not saying she's not.
All I'm saying is this is the universe
telling you: seize your moment. Be a
little selfish and pursue your career.
Bob Dalavan's gonna be here on
Thursday. If you book the Montreal
Comedy Festival, it would change things
for you. You don't wanna get stuck in
Chicago, right? You don't wanna be like
Sam Highsmith. He's been doing the
"people say Sam" bit since '03.

NAME: Side_5
People say, Sam...

NAME: Person_6
Is that what you want?

NAME: Person_1
It's amazing. It's the same material.

NAME: Side_5
What do people say?

NAME: Side_17
Sam!

NAME: Side_5
People say what?

NAME: Side_17
Sam!

NAME: Side_5
I'm Sam Highsmith. Thank you very much!

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna tell him. I'm gonna tell him
how I actually feel about it.

NAME: Person_1
Great set, dude!

NAME: Side_5
Crushing it!

NAME: Person_1
Love the new stuff!

NAME: Person_1
We should be ashamed of ourselves.

NAME: Person_6
We're weak.

NAME: Side_2
I wouldn't really call it an obsession
but... I'm pretty good at magic.

NAME: Person_7
Can you make his belly disappear?

NAME: Person_9
No, I'm too happy with my belly.

NAME: Side_2
Does anyone have a dollar?

NAME: Person_9
I will give you something.

NAME: Side_2
20? Big spender. Andrew Jackson? Don't
you think he'd look cool with sunglasses?

NAME: Side_2
We sprinkle the magic dust on.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, you can't do it without the magic
dust.

NAME: Side_2
Yeah, I need it. All right...

NAME: Side_2
Ok. Watching carefully -

NAME: Side_14
That is amazing! And he does look
better with glasses!

NAME: Person_1
How did you do that?

NAME: Side_2
Oh no, a magician never reveals her
tricks. Here's your twenty back, Mr.
Nanjiani.

NAME: Person_9
Do you think I could use this twenty
dollar bill to buy something?

NAME: Side_2
It looks better now, right?

NAME: Person_1
I was watching this monster movie with my
friend and he turned to me and was like,
"what would you do in that situation?"
I'm never going to be one of the last
guys alive. I'm going to be the first guy
to die. I die so the other characters get
to find out something weird is going on.
I go off alone to find the cat.

NAME: Person_1
I never even find out that there were
monsters. To me, the plot of the movie
was "we're at a research facility and the
cat's missing." The end.

NAME: Person_1
Denise. This is your name in Urdu.

NAME: Side_21
Wow, that is so cool.

NAME: Side_9
Kumail? Hey, Bob Dalavan.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I know you.

NAME: Side_9
You had some very interesting premises in
your set tonight.

NAME: Person_1
Thanks.

NAME: Side_9
I just wanted you to know that you made
the finals for the Montreal Showcase.

NAME: Person_1
Oh my god. Thank you.

NAME: Side_9
You too, Mary. Congrats.

NAME: Side_1
Oh, ok!

NAME: Side_9
So we'll see you guys up there. We'll
be in touch.

NAME: Person_5
What about C-Dog?

NAME: Side_9
Who's that?

NAME: Person_5
Um, me. What about me?

NAME: Side_27
You know, funny stuff, okay?

NAME: Side_21
Do you wanna go somewhere?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, let's go somewhere.

NAME: Person_1
Hello?

NAME: Side_13
Kumail. It's Jessie.

NAME: Person_1
Hey.     Who?

NAME: Side_13
Jessie. I'm in school with Emily.
Listen, Emily is in the hospital.

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_1
Hi. I am looking for Emily Gardner. Um,
Emily Gardner? She was checked in...

NAME: Person_1
Hey.

NAME: Person_2
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_1
Jessie called me and wanted me to make
sure you were okay. So how are you
doing?

NAME: Person_2
Fine. Totally fine. Never been better.
A thousand percent fine. Just like
fainted a little at work. I didn't have
breakfast this morning.

NAME: Person_1
Breakfast is the most important meal of
the day. You know that.

NAME: Side_18
Ms. Gardner. Your room will be ready
soon. Okay?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, no, actually I'd love to go home
and sleep in my own bed.

NAME: Side_18
Sir, can you step outside a moment,
please? If you want to stay you have to
go to the security desk to get a pass.

NAME: Person_1
Where is the security desk?

NAME: Side_18
It's downstairs. Exactly where you walked
in. At the security desk.

NAME: Person_1
The security desk is at the security
desk. Got it.

NAME: Person_1
Can I get you something? Water. Juice.
Coffee?

NAME: Side_10
May I speak with you for a second?

NAME: Person_1
I'll be right back.

NAME: Side_10
There is a massive infection in her
lungs. All her vitals are elevated.
Does she have HIV?

NAME: Person_1
What? No. I mean she--

NAME: Side_10
Are you her husband?

NAME: Person_1
No--

NAME: Side_10
We need to intubate her immediately. I
need a family member to sign this. So
I'm going to ask you again. Are you her
husband?

NAME: Person_1
What does "intubate" mean?

NAME: Side_10
We have to put her on a respirator and
to do that we need to put her in a
medically induced coma.

NAME: Person_1
Coma.

NAME: Side_10
Yes, to stabilize her so we can work on
the infection. And it needs to happen
right now. So, I'm going to ask you one
last time, are you her husband?

NAME: Person_2
What's going on?! Where are you taking
me?

NAME: Side_4
You should call her family.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, Mrs. Gardner? This is Kumail,
Emily's friend. I'm so sorry to be
calling you so late. Emily's fine.
Just want to get that taken care of.
She's fine. She is at City View
Hospital in Chicago in a medically
induced coma. But the doctors say that-
- Yes I did say coma.

NAME: Person_1
Hey. I'm Kumail.

NAME: Person_4
We know who you are Kumail.

NAME: Side_4
Mr. and Mrs. Gardner. The doctors would
like to see you now.

NAME: Person_4
Be right back.

NAME: Side_4
Listen, the doctor will be here any
minute. She's just running a little
late. Don't read anything into this
being in the bereavement room. It was
the only room we had available.

NAME: Person_3
Okay. Thank you.

NAME: Person_4
Terry, Terry-- it's driving me insane.

NAME: Person_3
I know, I know. But it makes me feel
better.

NAME: Side_3
Hello.

NAME: Side_3
Please sit. I'm Dr. Cunningham, Emily's
attending. I'll be coordinating all the
doctors and orchestrating her treatment
strategy.

NAME: Person_4
"All the doctors"? How many are there?

NAME: Side_3
Five.

NAME: Person_4
Five? Why so many? Is that normal?

NAME: Side_28
We immediately initiated orotracheal
intubation. Thankfully it hasn't affected
her heart at this point.

NAME: Side_29
We don't know the exact nature of the
infection yet, but we've got her on a
broad spectrum of antibiotics.

NAME: Side_30
...critical infections centering around
the costodiaphragmatic--

NAME: Side_11
Our theory is methicillin-resistant
staphylococcus aureus.

NAME: Person_3
Hold on. Is staphylococcus with an "f"
or a "ph"?

NAME: Side_11
Ph.

NAME: Person_1
That was very reassuring, wasn't it?
Apparently, there are good and bad
comas. And the kind that they put her
in, the medically induced ones, are
definitely the good kind of coma.

NAME: Person_1
Like you know how there are good and
bad carbs. Gremlins, those can be good
or bad.

NAME: Person_3
Listen, Kumail... We're gonna handle
things from here. You've been very
helpful. Thank you. For signing the
thing-

NAME: Person_1
My pleasure

NAME: Person_3
But you can go now.

NAME: Person_1
Oh... okay... all right. Peace in the
Mideast.

NAME: Person_5
What about this? I saw a sniffer dog at
the airport get a boner. Does that mean
drugs or bombs?

NAME: Person_6
That's good. What if instead of it being
at the airport, you quit comedy and never
did comedy ever again?

NAME: Person_5
Fuck you. It's a good bit.

NAME: Person_6
Just for the sake of the public. So they
wouldn't have to look at your face or
hear your words.

NAME: Person_1
It's okay that I'm not there, right?
Like, I don't need to be there, right?

NAME: Side_5
What happened?

NAME: Person_5
He put his girlfriend in a coma. You
know, the way you do.

NAME: Side_1
He signed a paper that allowed doctors to
put her--

NAME: Person_6
He suggested it.

NAME: Person_1
She's gonna be fine. She's gonna be fine.
They said she's gonna be fine. Doctors
know medical stuff. That's what doctors
do. They're good at medical stuff. This
is a medically induced coma. This is
their specialty.

NAME: Side_1
Maybe.

NAME: Person_5
It might be a good thing. She might wake
up with a new skill. Like my cousin
blacked out once and when he came to, he
thought he knew a different language.

NAME: Person_6
Did he?

NAME: Person_5
No, it was just gibberish that he made
up. It was brain damage.

NAME: Side_5
I got another Taco Bell one...

NAME: Person_4
Did you forget something?

NAME: Person_1
Is she up yet?

NAME: Person_3
No, she's not. They won't tell us
anything. We've been here all morning.

NAME: Person_1
I know you guys said you don't need me
to stay, but I think I'm just going to
wait anyway.

NAME: Person_4
You guys broke up. I'm not sure why
you're here. You don't have to worry
about being committed to anything,
Kumail. You didn't want to when she was
awake. There's no need to do it when
she's unconscious.

NAME: Person_1
It's more complicated than that--

NAME: Person_4
Is it? Because I know about the two-day
rule, I know about the headshots and the
secrets. She tells us everything.
You really don't have to stay Kumail. You
have already done a lot.

NAME: Person_1
I'm just gonna stay for a second. Is this
seat- ?

NAME: Person_1
Is that lady still looking at me?

NAME: Person_3
No reason you should eat there by
yourself. Right, hon?

NAME: Person_4
It's a free country.

NAME: Person_1
How's your sandwich?

NAME: Person_4
Best fuckin' sandwich I've ever had.

NAME: Person_3
Mine's good. Tuna's always a gamble.
You know, we're not by the water. Well,
we are by the water, but it's a lake.
There's no tuna in the lake. Whatever.
I threw the dice. I got the 7's, I
guess. Whatever the good dice number
is.

NAME: Person_3
So, uh, 9/11?

NAME: Person_3
No, I mean, I've always wanted to have a
conversation about it with...people.

NAME: Person_1
You've never talked to people about 9/11?

NAME: Person_3
No, uh, what's your stance?

NAME: Person_1
What's my stance on 9/11? Oh, ummmm...
Anti. It was a tragedy.
I mean we lost 19 of our best guys.

NAME: Person_4
Huh?

NAME: Person_1
That was a joke, obviously. 9/11 was a
terrible tragedy, and it's not funny to
joke about it.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, can I come?

NAME: Person_3                            Person_4
Yeah.                         No.

NAME: Person_4
Whatever.

NAME: Side_3
I know this isn't the news you were
hoping for but we aren't ready to bring
Emily out of the coma yet.

NAME: Person_4
Oh. I-

NAME: Person_3
What happened?

NAME: Side_3
The antibiotics aren't doing exactly
what we'd hoped they would, and we
don't want to mess around. So we're
going to perform surgery tomorrow
morning to remove the infection.

NAME: Person_4
Wait a second- Dr. Spellman told us
that the antibiotics would work. He
didn't say anything at all about
surgery.

NAME: Person_3
What does that mean? What kind of
surgery?

NAME: Side_3
It's called thoracentesis, it's a very
common procedure. We're going to go in
between the ribs and remove the
infection.

NAME: Person_3
How do you spell that please? Thora- ?
What's the last part?

NAME: Side_3
-Centesis.

NAME: Person_4
And where is the infection?

NAME: Side_3
On the lung.

NAME: Person_4
What's the risk?

NAME: Side_3
Low. My advice to you is that you go
home, you get something to eat, and try
to relax.

NAME: Person_3
She left the lights on, eh?

NAME: Person_4
My favorite sweater.

NAME: Person_4
I'm gonna do some research.

NAME: Person_3
Oh hey, that's the book I gave her.

NAME: Person_4
No, I gave her that one. Hey, do you
have that little notebook from the
doctors?

NAME: Person_3
No, this is the book I gave her.

NAME: Person_1
I'm just gonna clean up Emily's rooms
real quick.

NAME: Person_4
I remember. I met her at the falafel
place and then we went to that book store
that's hardly ever open and I bought it
for her.

NAME: Person_3
You're not the only one who gives her
things.

NAME: Person_4
What's up with you?

NAME: Person_3
I'm just tired of you thinking that
you're the only one who gives her things.
I gave her that book.

NAME: Person_4
Look at the inscription.

NAME: Person_3
No. That's stupid.

NAME: Person_1
Hey.

NAME: Person_3
Sorry... Didn't mean to surprise you. I
was just wondering if we wanna do
anything. Got any parlor games...

NAME: Person_1
I don't-what are parlor games?

NAME: Person_3
Card games, word games. You play any word
games?

NAME: Person_1
No, I've never played-

NAME: Person_3
You ever played You Can't Rhyme It?

NAME: Person_1
How does that go?

NAME: Person_3
It's basically where you try to find a
word, a real word, that nobody can rhyme.

NAME: Person_1
Ok, Stonehenge.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, see you would win. That'd be a
winner.

NAME: Person_1
I don't play board games. I play video
games.

NAME: Person_3
That's the thing. Everybody now needs
Nintendo, the game thing, electronics, a
thousand dollars. When I was a kid, a
piece of chalk and a pavement, that's
your entertainment. Hopscotch, tic tac
toe, throw the chalk at Jimmy. There you
go, three games right there.

NAME: Person_1
Jimmy was a real guy?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, well there was no particular Jimmy,
whoever got hit with the chalk, he was
the Jimmy.

NAME: Person_3
I'm just trying to figure out what to do.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, tonight's no good for me. I'd
love to, but I'm actually gigging
tonight, which is like an industry word
we use for when we do shows.

NAME: Person_3
Really?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, there's a big Montreal Comedy
festival audition coming up, and I'm
actually headlining tonight.

NAME: Person_3
Oh. That's cool. I haven't been to
comedy show since the 80's - Rita
Rudner at Caroline's. Remember that,
hon?

NAME: Person_4
Christ. Pleural effusion and empyema, --

NAME: Person_3
Maybe we should go to Kumail's show.
What do you think? Wouldn't that be
fun?

NAME: Person_4
Oh my god. These pictures are horrible.

NAME: Person_3
Okay listen, why don't we go to the
comedy club with him? It'll take our
mind off of things right now.

NAME: Person_4
I don't want to get my mind off it,
Terry. Our daughter's having surgery
tomorrow.

NAME: Person_3
Please. I need the distraction.

NAME: Person_4
Well then why don't you go?

NAME: Person_3
No, I want you to come with me. I don't
wanna be alone.

NAME: Person_4
All right. But I'm bringing my iPad.

NAME: Person_1
Ah it's sold out. I should've said it
before you guys had the whole
discussion. It sold out super quickly.
They were shocked at how quickly it
sold out.

NAME: Person_3
But you can get us in? You're the
headliner, right? That's what you said.
I mean, if you're the headliner, you
can get two more in, right?

NAME: Person_1
That's a good point.

NAME: Person_3
We'll sit in the back. They got food
there?

NAME: Person_1
They've got waffle fries and um-

NAME: Person_3
The hospital had waffle fries too.

NAME: Side_12
I've actually never been to   Pakistan. My
parents moved here for grad   school and
they just stayed here. I've   never even
been to Canada. So uh, when   is Kumail
coming?

NAME: Person_7
He's coming. Right, Naveed? Traffic?

NAME: Person_8
I heard everything's bumper-to-bumper
on the Dan Ryan Expressway.

NAME: Side_12
That's weird because I took the Dan
Ryan Expressway here.

NAME: Person_5
What is your dad's sister's favorite kind
of music to dance to?

NAME: Person_1
Emily's parents are here.

NAME: Side_1
Tonight? Why?

NAME: Person_5
Is anybody here from out of town?

NAME: Person_5
A few, a few. What's your name, sir?

NAME: Person_3
Terry.

NAME: Person_5
Terry. And who's this lady next to you?
Is it Cloth? A little Terry Cloth?

NAME: Person_4
It's Beth.

NAME: Person_5
Beth. Pretty close. Terry-Beth, where
are you guys from?

NAME: Person_3
We're from North Carolina.

NAME: Person_5
Ooh North Carolina. The Tar Heel State!
Home of Krispy Kreme donuts! And what
brings you to Chicago?

NAME: Person_4
Our daughter's in a coma.

NAME: Person_5
Where are you from?

NAME: Side_12
It's getting late, I should go.

NAME: Person_9
No, I think I should call him up, I'll
just call him up.
Hello, Kumi-beta? What do you mean, who
is calling? This is your father. Ok, ok.
He will be here any moment.
I just faked that call. Did you call
him?

NAME: Person_8
A hundred times. No response.

NAME: Side_12
I think I should make something clear.
I can understand what you're saying.

NAME: Side_14
I thought you said you'd never been to
Pakistan.

NAME: Side_12
I said I'd never been there but we speak
it at home.

NAME: Person_9
For someone who's never been to Pakistan
you speak Urdu very well.

NAME: Side_12
Thanks.

NAME: Person_9
Do you want to sing?

NAME: Person_1
I want to name my kid Void so he won't be
able to cash any of his paychecks.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry, sir, this says Void on it. But
that's my name. Curse you, father!
I work on the second floor of the bank in
this fantasy scenario.

NAME: Side_6
Go back to ISIS!

NAME: Person_1
Toast is a really strange food.

NAME: Person_4
What did you just say?

NAME: Side_6
I said, he should go back to ISIS.

NAME: Person_1
Toast is the only food that-

NAME: Person_4
Well that's a really confusing
position. Do you want ISIS to have more
people?

NAME: Side_6
No I was saying that to him because...

NAME: Person_4
Guess what everybody? We've got an ISIS
recruiter here.

NAME: Person_1
Glad we got to the bottom of that.
Toast is like a-

NAME: Person_4
What is it about him that made you say
that?

NAME: Person_1
I think we know what the answer is.

NAME: Side_6
Lady I wasn't talking to you.

NAME: Person_4
What is it about him?

NAME: Person_1
We don't have to go down this path. We
know what's at the end of it.

NAME: Side_6
Cuz of how he looks.

NAME: Person_1
There it is.

NAME: Person_4
That is like saying that all frat boys
wearing country club hats and Hawaiian
shirts have shriveled up, tiny little
dicks!

NAME: Person_1
Actually, Beth, this is a bad way for
you to find out, but he's right. I
actually am a terrorist. I just do
stand-up comedy on the side to keep a
low profile.

NAME: Side_6
Fuck you.

NAME: Person_1
First of all, very clever. Did you write
that at home? Toast is-

NAME: Person_4
Fuck you!

NAME: Side_6
Fuck you.

NAME: Person_4
No fuck you!

NAME: Side_6
You're a bitch, you know that?

NAME: Person_4
(being dragged out by
security)
I'm gonna fucking kill you! What's your
fucking phone number?!

NAME: Person_3
I'm sorry everybody. I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_3
I'm not sorry actually cause you're a
terrible person... I don't want to kick
your ass here in front of everybody.
Yeah, that's right. I've got levels,
motherfucker. This elevator goes all
the way fucking down, you fucking
prick!

NAME: Person_4
I think I'll make tea.
Actually I'll open a bottle of wine.
Does Emily have whiskey?

NAME: Person_1
On top of the fridge.

NAME: Person_3
So uh, Cubs doing good, huh?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know anything about baseball.

NAME: Person_4
I am so sorry about that. That was... I
just sort of lost control.

NAME: Person_3
I thought it was sexy.

NAME: Person_1
Me too. Not like sexy, but like cool
sexy. Not like aroused sexy. I'm gonna
not say sexy anymore.

NAME: Person_4
Hey, you guys wanna get something to eat?

NAME: Person_4
So is it always like that?

NAME: Person_1
Oh like tonight? No, usually a
different mom comes in to help me. I'm
joking. No, it's not always like that.
I'd quit if it was.

NAME: Person_3
Here's a joke.

NAME: Person_4
No, Terry, don't. Terry's about as
funny as a fart at a funeral.

NAME: Person_3
This is funny, this is a funny one. A
giraffe walks into a bar and he says to
the bartender, "Highballs on me." You
get it, right?

NAME: Person_1
Oh that was the end of the joke?

NAME: Person_3
Yes.

NAME: Person_1
That was the whole joke?

NAME: Person_3
That's the joke. That's the beauty of it,
boom.

NAME: Person_1
I thought there was more.

NAME: Person_3
He's a giraffe, he's tall, so it would
stand to reason his testicles are high
and a highball is a type of drink, and
you ruined it by saying I wasn't funny
first.

NAME: Person_1
No, it's good. I like my jokes thoroughly
explained.

NAME: Person_3
You're just busting my high balls.

NAME: Person_3
Complex finish. Flamboyant mouth-feel.
Good. How about you?

NAME: Person_1
Hmm, fruit-forward.

NAME: Person_3
Good term. Absolutely fruit-forward.

NAME: Person_1
This one is in the front seat. It's
driving the wine car.

NAME: Person_3
Exactly.

NAME: Person_4
I like wine cause of the buzz.

NAME: Person_3
She's a bit of a lightweight.

NAME: Person_4
So is Terry! He'll be passed out on the
sofa in less than an hour!

NAME: Person_3
Ah that's nonsense. You know that's not
true.

NAME: Person_4
You weren't supposed to be on the show
tonight, were you?

NAME: Person_1
Oh? Me on the show tonight? Yeah, yeah
I was. I was the headliner.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. I lied about the show to get out
of hanging out with you guys. And then
I lied about headlining to impress you
guys.

NAME: Person_4
Well that didn't work.

NAME: Person_1
Also, I think I screwed up with your
daughter.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, you did.
I don't know how people do it when
their family's sick. My Uncle Lew, he
got cancer, then he had a stroke, then
a heart attack, then he had a
recurrence of the cancer. But you know
what killed him?

NAME: Person_1
Cancer?

NAME: Person_4
Car accident. We think maybe it was a
heart attack while he was driving. And
he did still have cancer too. And you
know what? He ate sprouts his whole
fucking life. Hadn't had a yolk in 30
years. I don't know how I'm going to
sleep tonight.

NAME: Person_1
You wanna stress eat?

NAME: Person_4
Fuck yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Oh my god.

NAME: Person_4
Most noticeable. Oh no, hold on,
there's more.

NAME: Person_4
The legendary cemetery photo shoot.

NAME: Person_1
Oh my god.

NAME: Person_4
I laughed so hard when I saw these. She
got so mad at me.

NAME: Person_1
You're gonna wake him up.

NAME: Person_4
Are you kidding me? He can sleep through
anything. Hey Terry!

NAME: Person_1
How did you and Terry meet?

NAME: Person_4
I was going to East Carolina University
and I was waiting tables. We met at
this coffee shop, I was waiting on him.
I liked his hair. He was a teacher
already. Thick New York accent like
nobody I'd ever met. Totally wrong for
me. So naturally we fell-in-love. My
family could not stand him. We're all
military people, army pilots. All my
brothers played football. Terry
couldn't even change a tire. My father
got so mad he broke every dinner plate
we had. Now back then, you go to the
gas station, you fill up your tank, you
get a dinner plate. But just one at a
time. Cup, saucer. It took us a year of
fill-ups to get the whole set back. And
Terry just stuck around. Eventually
they just all got over it.

NAME: Person_1
They just got over it. How?

NAME: Person_4
Lots of fucked up dinners. How'd your
parents meet, Kumail?

NAME: Person_1
So we have arranged marriage as you
know. A big group got together to see a
movie, but really it was just a set up
so my mom and dad could meet.

NAME: Person_4
What movie did they see?

NAME: Person_1
I have no idea. I never asked.

NAME: Person_4
She's great, you know?

NAME: Person_1
I know.

NAME: Person_4
I feel good about this surgery.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. These doctors know what they're
doing.

NAME: Person_4
No they don't. They're just winging it
like everybody else.

NAME: Person_1
Fuck.

NAME: Person_2'S VOICE
Hey it's me. So I tried making some
Pakistani food to surprise you. And
either I'm a bad cook or all Pakistani
food is terrible. I don't know yet. Bye!

NAME: Person_2'S VOICE
Hey it's me. If you just wanna come over
and like kiss me for two seconds, I'd
really love that tonight. Ok. Bye!

NAME: Person_2'S VOICE
Hey it's me. So did you want to meet at
the gallery, or - Oh my god! Oh my god, a
bird just hit me in the head. Oh my god
I'm not kidding. I'll call you right
back. Oh my god, is it okay?

NAME: Side_11
The infection around the lungs was
removed. We should be able to pull her
out soon.

NAME: Person_3
Oh boy.

NAME: Person_4
How soon?

NAME: Side_11
She should be up by tomorrow morning at
the latest. We'll also test the pleural
fluid from the thoracentesis so we can
create a more targeted antibiotic
strategy.

NAME: Person_4
So this is good news?

NAME: Side_11
It's very good news. We'll just hold
onto her for a few more days and then
you can have her back.

NAME: Person_3
She's a fighter, right?

NAME: Side_11
Yes.

NAME: Person_7
I was so worried. We saw on the news
that a train derailed and we thought
that you were on the train and you had
died.

NAME: Person_1
Nobody died on that train, Ma.

NAME: Person_7
But did they look under the train?

NAME: Person_9
So, where were you last night? What were
you doing?

NAME: Person_1
Nothing. I wasn't doing anything.

NAME: Person_7
Kumail.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, I'll tell you. I was...
studying for the LSAT.

NAME: Person_7
Really?

NAME: Person_1
Yup. I signed up. And if I pass, I'm
gonna go to law school, become a
lawyer, and do law.

NAME: Person_7
Oh, let me see who that could be.

NAME: Person_1
Really, Dad? You said that nobody was
gonna come. That it was gonna be just
us.

NAME: Person_8
Hey Kumi, do you know this guy? People
say Sam. People say Sam. Do you know him?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I know.

NAME: Side_14
He should be on Saturday Night Live.

NAME: Person_7
Everybody remember Khadija? She just
dropped in. She was just in the
neighborhood.

NAME: Person_7
And these are her parents, Farhan and
Tina. They also just dropped in.

NAME: Side_2
I've just been through so many of these
appointments and I never have anything in
common with the guys. You know when girls
at work complain about dating, I just
want to body slam them. They have no
idea. I don't know. My mom says I'm
becoming the bruised apple at the bottom
of the apple bucket.

NAME: Person_1
No, no. You're not.

NAME: Side_2
I am.

NAME: Person_1
You're not.

NAME: Side_2
So do you want to hangout sometime? Like
without our parents? Have you been to the
cat cafe? The cats just come up to you
and nestle in your lap and you just pet
them.

NAME: Person_1
I don't think that's a good idea.

NAME: Side_2
You don't like cats?

NAME: Person_1
I mean I don't think it's a good idea for
us to hangout again. It's not you. You're
fantastic. I just can't do this arranged
marriage thing -- with anybody.

NAME: Side_2
So why did you meet me?

NAME: Person_1
It wasn't my idea.

NAME: Side_2
I'm just really tired. Do you ever want
to just be in a relationship so you can
finally relax?

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry. You deserve better than me.

NAME: Side_2
People are always telling me what I
deserve. It's bullshit. And stop being so
sorry about everything. I'm gonna go.

NAME: Side_2
And you know what? I watched the X-Files,
like three whole episodes, and it's a bad
show.

NAME: Person_3
Wow, they should call this website,
"Everything is Cancer Dot Com".
Everything you put in, it could be
cancer. Hiccups could be cancer. Come on.
You take the fun out of hiccups now.

NAME: Person_4
Do you know this is the 17th best
hospital in Chicago?

NAME: Person_3
Really? Out of how many?

NAME: Person_4
I don't know, but Northwestern's number
one.

NAME: Person_3
Well how do they rate it? What's their
methodology?

NAME: Person_4
I don't know, Terry. But 17th is bad.

NAME: Person_3
It's not great, unless the sample size
is, you know, that all depends.

NAME: Person_1
Here, look at the comments.

NAME: Person_3
This is why I don't want to go online
cause it's never good. You go online,
they hated Forrest Gump. Frickin' best
movie ever.

NAME: Side_3
Terry - Hi. Can we talk?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah.

NAME: Side_3
We got the biopsy results. They are
unfortunately inconclusive. We are
concerned-

NAME: Person_3
They couldn't find out what the disease
was, or where the virus came from or
the bacteria or whatever.

NAME: Person_1
But they took out the infection so it
shouldn't matter?

NAME: Person_3
I know, that's what I said but her
vitals didn't normalize. And now they
say that the infection is continuing to
spread, it's in her kidneys.

NAME: Person_1
But the kidneys are so far from the
lungs.

NAME: Person_3
I know, it's an aggressive infection
and they said what they gotta do now is
figure out what this mystery disease
actually is.

NAME: Person_4
I'm calling Northwestern.

NAME: Person_3
Just hold on, hold on.

NAME: Person_4
Terry! Goddammit!

NAME: Person_1
I think we should talk about this--

NAME: Person_4
--You shut up! I'm sick of this shit,
Terry. We're getting her out of here!

NAME: Person_3
They're in the middle of the whole
process of elimination.

NAME: Person_4
So you're saying Northwestern can't
take that information and continue the
search? This place is a shithole.

NAME: Person_4
I'm sorry. Anna, could I have that?

NAME: Person_3
Will you just stop for a second? They're
the doctors. You act like you know what
you're talking about. You don't.

NAME: Person_4
I can't find my cellphone. You got a
phone?

NAME: Person_3
Don't give her a phone. You don't need a
phone. You don't need to call anybody
right now.

NAME: Person_3
They're doing it. They're the experts
here, and I trust them.

NAME: Person_4
Well that's very nice. But I don't. Can
you unlock that thing?

NAME: Person_3
Oh - you think that you're smarter than
me because you say big sentences. Well
you're not!

NAME: Person_4
I don't think I'm smarter than you! You
just don't think you're as smart as I
am! That's not my fault!

NAME: Person_3
Right. It's never your fault.
Everything's my fault.

NAME: Person_4
Oh there are some things that are
definitely just your fault.

NAME: Person_3
Okay, that's bullshit. You need to stop
freaking out and calm down.

NAME: Person_4
And you need to stop being a coward.

NAME: Person_3
Greatest hits, coming back. You can
stop, I'll replay the rest of this from
memory.

NAME: Side_4
Oh, you're giraffe-ing it.

NAME: Person_1
It was the biggest thing they had. I
don't even know if she likes giraffes. We
never talked about giraffes. Hey, do
they know what they're doing? Cause
they don't tell us anything. Like, Lyme
Disease? You know the girl on The Real
World had it? Did you guys look for
that?

NAME: Side_4
Yes, we did.

NAME: Person_1
Did you know she gets hurt all the
time? She messed up her ankle recently -
could that be Lupus?

NAME: Side_4
Kumail. We're looking into everything.
We're not holding anything back from
you. We're still just eliminating
possibilities.

NAME: Person_1
Cause Beth wants to move her to
Northwestern.

NAME: Side_4
Oh no. Emily should not be moved. The
hospital will approve it because it'll
get the liability off their hands, but
we put her in a coma for a reason. To
stabilize her. Moving her could be very
dangerous. The infection could spread.
Trust me she is fighting. And so are
we.

NAME: Person_1
Hey Terry. I was just talking to the
nurse - You okay?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, of course. Totally fine.

NAME: Person_3
Beth went to Emily's, so I'm gonna wait
here until they kick me out. Keep an
eye on her.

NAME: Person_1
Do you wanna crash at my place?

NAME: Person_3
You got the golf channel?

NAME: Person_1
No.

NAME: Person_3
That wasn't funny, right?

NAME: Person_1
I thought that was a serious question.

NAME: Person_3
Let's get the fuck out of here.

NAME: Person_1
So this is the place.

NAME: Person_3
Wow...this place is terrible.

NAME: Person_1
Hey I talked to Nurse Judy, and she was
saying that moving Emily could be a bad
idea.

NAME: Person_3
Really?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, she said it could be dangerous.

NAME: Person_1
Like...

NAME: Person_3
No. Yeah. I hear you. I'd give anything
to trade places with Emily. Being a
parent, it's a nightmare. Loving
somebody this much sucks.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah.

NAME: Person_3
And I guess you've noticed some tension
between Beth and me.

NAME: Person_1
Not really. That's none of my business.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah well, it's there. Big time.

NAME: Person_1
It's getting really late. We should go
to sleep.

NAME: Person_3
I cheated on her.

NAME: Person_1
Fuuuuck.

NAME: Person_3
I did. It was just a one night stand.

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_3
We met at some bar in Cincinnati. They
have these teacher conferences. Who
goes to a math conference to get laid?

NAME: Person_1
Math teachers?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah. I think I was depressed, that's
what it was.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Let's talk about it tomorrow. Get a
full night's sleep. Catch up fresh in the-

NAME: Person_3
She just smelled so good. It was horrible
too. As soon as I was finished. As soon
as I'd finished, I was like, what did you
fucking do?! What did you just do?!

NAME: Person_3
What did you do?! You know that moment of
clarity you get right after an orgasm?

NAME: Person_1
Yup.

NAME: Person_3
I told Beth right away. I had to. She
was devastated. Now she hates me.

NAME: Person_1
She might be mad at you, but she doesn't
hate you. You should've heard the way she
was talking about you. Hey, can I ask you
something? Why did you tell her?

NAME: Person_3
Oh, I had to. I'm no good with guilt.

NAME: Person_1
Do you guys talk about it?

NAME: Person_3
Not anymore. She said she forgave me,
but no. She hasn't. Let me give you
some advice Kumail. You're going to
know the woman you want to spend the
rest of your life with when you cheat
on her. When you cheat on her and you
just feel like shit.

NAME: Person_1
So, to fully know I love someone, I
have to cheat on them?

NAME: Person_3
Out loud it sounds stupid. Yeah, that's
terrible advice.

NAME: Person_3
Love isn't easy. That's why they call
it love.

NAME: Person_1
I don't really get that either.

NAME: Person_3
I know. I thought I could just start
saying something and something smart
would come out.

NAME: Person_1
Hey did you see Terry?

NAME: Person_5
No, I heard him leave this morning. I'm
going to Sevies. You want anything?

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm good, thank you.

NAME: Person_5
You don't want a hot dog or nothing?

NAME: Person_1
Dude it's 8:30 in the morning.

NAME: Person_5
Okay, no hot dog.

NAME: Person_7
We just spoke to Khadija's parents.

NAME: Person_1
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_7
What is wrong with you, Kumi?

NAME: Person_1
Nothing is wrong with me. I'm sorry-

NAME: Person_7
Sorry? That's all you have to say?

NAME: Person_1
I wasn't that into her.

NAME: Person_7
"Into her"? Do you know how difficult
it is to get an appointment with her?
She is in very high demand.

NAME: Person_1
Okay. So?

NAME: Person_7
So?

NAME: Person_1
Can we please talk about this another
time?

NAME: Person_7
No, no, Kumi. We will talk about this
now. We have sacrificed everything for
you.

NAME: Person_1
I know, okay?

NAME: Person_7
We have left our family. We have left
our home. I have missed the birth of my
sister's daughter. I have not seen my
mother for fifteen years. Your father,
he had to do his graduate school.
Again. He had to give exams. Again.

NAME: Person_9
I was in my mid 50's. They were in 20s.
They used to call me Father Time!

NAME: Person_1
I know that. I really appreciate
everything you did for me, but can we
talk about this another time?

NAME: Person_7
Kumi, if you don't want to be a lawyer,
fine. If you want to do the stand-up
comedy and embarrass us as a family,
fine. There is only one thing that we
have ever asked from you: that you be a
good Muslim and that you marry a
Pakistani girl. That is it, one thing!

NAME: Person_1
Can I ask you something that has never
made sense to me? Why did you bring me
here if you wanted me to not have an
American life?

NAME: Person_1
We come here but we pretend like we're
still back there? That's so stupid!

NAME: Person_9
Don't you talk to your mother like
that!

NAME: Person_1
You don't care what I think. You just
want me to follow the rules. But the
rules don't make sense to me. I don't
pray. I don't. I haven't prayed in
years. I just go down there and I play
video games.

NAME: Person_9
You don't believe in Allah?

NAME: Person_1
I don't know what I believe, Dad! I
don't know. And I can't marry someone
you find for me.

NAME: Person_7
And why not?

NAME: Person_1
Because I'm in love with someone. I am.
Her name is Emily and she's gonna be a
therapist. And right now she's very
sick but I couldn't tell you that. It
makes me so sad that I couldn't tell
you any of that. I really appreciate
everything you've done for me. I truly,
truly do. And I know Islam has been
really good for you, it has made you
good people, but I don't know what I
believe. I just need to figure it out
on my own.

NAME: Person_7
You're not my son.

NAME: Person_9
Kumi, you're being selfish. You're not
thinking about us. You're not thinking
about Khadija. In fact you're not even
thinking about that girl that you are in
love with. You think American Dream is
just about doing whatever you want and
not thinking about other people?

NAME: Person_9
You're wrong! You are wrong!

NAME: Person_5
Hey... I never went to the store. I was
just listening at the door. My mom kicked
me out for dealing weed at sixteen, so I
get it man.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, so when are we going to talk to Beth
about what we talked about?

NAME: Person_3
We're gonna move her.

NAME: Person_1
What? What are you talking about? You
fucking caved?

NAME: Person_3
I didn't cave. I don't cave.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, okay. I know you don't cave. You're
great. But we talked about this last
night.

NAME: Person_3
I know. We're moving her. She's right.

NAME: Person_1
What? No. I told you what the nurse
said. Hey Beth, the nurse told me that
moving Emily could be a very bad idea.

NAME: Person_4
Well Northwestern told us it could be
very good.

NAME: Person_1
Well, they don't see her. This nurse
sees her and she told me herself.

NAME: Person_3
It's okay. They don't need to see her.

NAME: Person_1
It's not okay. There. I got it!

NAME: Person_3
That's a map of the garage.

NAME: Person_1
Wait, wait! Do you want to be
responsible? She could die!

NAME: Person_4
Kumail, we're responsible for her no
matter what. We're her parents. Now I'm
sorry, we're moving her.

NAME: Side_7
Welcome to Quick'n Hot. May I take your
order please?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, um can I get a burger with 4
slices of cheese.

NAME: Side_7
Four burgers. Anything else sir?

NAME: Person_1
No. One burger with four slices of
cheese.

NAME: Person_1
One burger with four-

NAME: Side_7
I'm sorry. We can't do that.

NAME: Person_1
Just put 4 slices of cheese on a
burger.

NAME: Side_7
We can't do that. There's no button -

NAME: Person_1
Who the fuck is this "we", man? Who the
fuck is this "we"? It's me and you.
We're just people. Fucking listen to
me. Fuck this corporate entity. Put
four slices of cheese on THE FUCKING

NAME: Side_7
We can't do that.

NAME: Person_1
What the fuck, you fucking idiot?

NAME: Person_1
Hey, look at me. Cause I'm a human
being. You're a human being. Look at
me. Look me in the eyes when you fuck
me! Look at me. PLEASE!

NAME: Side_7
Today's my first day.

NAME: Person_1
Fuck you!

NAME: Side_7
I'll just ring you up for four burgers.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry.

NAME: Side_7
Do you want any fries or drink with
that?

NAME: Person_1
I'll take four fries. I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_1
Fuck!

NAME: Person_5
Hey man, Montreal finals. You ready? Oh
wait, are you getting all dark and
moody before your set? Yeah, punish
yourself like a nasty little baby.

NAME: Person_1
I am not in the mood. Okay Chris?

NAME: Person_5
I'll get you in the mood.

NAME: Person_5
I'll get you all in the mood.

NAME: Person_6
You all right?

NAME: Person_1
Why does everybody say the same fucking
thing? Yeah, I'm doing great.

NAME: Person_6
Okay, all right dude. I'm just checking.

NAME: Side_8
The fuck've you been, man? You're on
next!

NAME: Side_8
This next performer, my man, Mr. Kumail
Nanjiani!

NAME: Person_1
Have you guys heard of this new drug
cocktail called cheese? Like that's the
name of it, it's called cheese. I saw
all these news reports, and they were
like, there's a new drug, it's called
cheese. Everyone's doing it in the
Midwest, kids are doing it.

NAME: Person_1
It's just really hard to do stand-up
comedy when your girlfriend is in a
coma.

NAME: Person_1
Not quite sure what part you're
laughing at. They say she's fighting,
but she doesn't look like she's
fighting. She looks like she's just
laying there. I said horrible things to
her. I hurt her. She loves birds. Like
she gets excited every time she sees a
bird. She's like, look at this, it's a
bird. And I'm always like, yeah,
they're all over the place, they're
birds. But she likes that bird. Every
bird she sees, she sees it.

NAME: Person_1
Her dad just called and said that they
can't transfer her because the infection
has reached her heart. Which means...
She could die.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know if you can hear me or not,
but it would be really good if you pulled
through. If you have to go, you can go,
but it would be really great if you
stayed. And I'm really sorry about what I
did -

NAME: Person_2
Mom. You're getting your tears all over
me. When am I gonna be able to feel my
face?

NAME: Person_3
You gave us quite a scare there, Scout.

NAME: Person_2
Scout?

NAME: Person_3
Come on. I call you that all the time.

NAME: Person_2
No. Not since I was a grown up.

NAME: Person_3
I've called you that your whole life!

NAME: Side_4
Sorry hon.

NAME: Person_2
What is that crap?

NAME: Side_4
We have to thicken your liquids for a
bit. Your esophagus isn't strong enough
to swallow yet.

NAME: Person_2
That shit tastes like semen.

NAME: Person_3
That's nice for a father to hear.

NAME: Side_3
She won't have any social inhibitions
until the anesthetic wears off.

NAME: Person_2
It does! Seriously, Mom. You should try
this.

NAME: Person_4
Oh wait a minute, honey!

NAME: Person_3
Oh, come on, come on. They'll charge us
forty eight dollars for it, don't worry
about it.

NAME: Person_2
Why are you here?

NAME: Person_1
I haven't heard her voice in a while.

NAME: Person_4
He's been here the whole time.

NAME: Side_3
Could I speak with you both outside?

NAME: Person_4
Honey, we'll be right outside.

NAME: Person_1
Hey.

NAME: Side_3
Emily has a rare condition called Adult
Onset Still's disease. Kumail mentioned
Emily's hurt ankle and the swelling
still hadn't gone down even after
several days in bed, which is strange.
Still's disease is when the body thinks
healthy tissue is an infection so it
tries to fight it. It's like a big
biological misunderstanding.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, yeah.

NAME: Side_32
We gave her anti-inflammatories and she
stabilized within hours. She's gonna
take time to recover but she'll be
fine.

NAME: Person_3
Wow.

NAME: Person_2
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_1
I was visiting someone down the hall and
I was like, I'll just pop in and say hi
to Emily.

NAME: Person_2
Oh.

NAME: Person_1
No, I'm joking, I was here for you.

NAME: Person_2
You're an asshole and I don't like you.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not an asshole. I'm really not.

NAME: Person_2
No, you're an asshole.

NAME: Person_1
You have a lot of drugs in you so you're
not thinking as clearly.

NAME: Person_2
Naw dog. I'm not joking. You're not funny
to me. You just make me sad. You make me
sad inside of my heart, and it makes me
sad to look at you. So I think you should
probably go. Just go and tell my mom I
want her.

NAME: Person_2
Will you please get my mom?

NAME: Person_1
Emily wants to see you.

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna head out. I don't think I
should be here.

NAME: Person_3
Alright, Kumail. Here's the thing. Your
living condition is a potential health
risk and you're not that funny. But....
you're probably not suited to do
anything else either so that's
troublesome--

NAME: Person_1
You really made it sound like you were
going to say something positive there.

NAME: Person_3
I guess I did, didn't I? You know I
know the good stuff. You know how I
feel. I gotta get in there.

NAME: Person_1
So you gonna hang around Chicago for a
while?

NAME: Person_4
Yeah. She's got physical therapy.

NAME: Person_1
Did you ever think you'd be excited to
have your daughter go through physical
therapy?
It's so strange that we could go
through one of the most intense
experiences of our lives together and
just never see each other again.

NAME: Person_4
Maybe. But I hope not.

NAME: Side_1
Hi little sad man. Mopey boy. We have
something to tell you. We are moving to
New York. And we want you to come with
us.

NAME: Person_1
Are you serious?

NAME: Person_6
You gotta do it. It's going to suck at
first but we'll have each other and
maybe eventually get paid to write
jokes. It's gonna be the best. Come on
dude.

NAME: Side_1
You have to come. I know you did not
get Montreal and that is only because
you did one of the worst sets I've ever
seen in my goddamn life.

NAME: Person_6
It was nonsense.

NAME: Side_1
A living disgrace.

NAME: Person_6
I would call it shit, but I would be
worried that I'd be insulting actual
shit.

NAME: Side_1
Yeah, it was so bone-chilling to me, I
thought a ghost had passed right through
me.

NAME: Person_1
We don't have to keep going over how bad
the set was. I saw their faces and the
noises they didn't make.

NAME: Side_1
I felt one of my eggs die.

NAME: Person_1
Doesn't that happen every month?

NAME: Side_1
It happens every month, Kumail, but I
don't always feel it and go, ohhhhh. And
that's what you made me do. I'm packing
my things up and I'm moving to New York,
and guess what, baby? You're coming with
me.

NAME: Person_1
What about Chris?

NAME: Side_1
He will be fine.

NAME: Person_6
There's not enough room in the car,
probably. We leave in a week, all
right? And I already called shotgun
Chicago to Pittsburgh. Do not fuck this
up.

NAME: Side_1
Your destiny awaits!

NAME: Person_6
This will be the biggest move of your
life. Other than the one from Pakistan.

NAME: Person_3
Hey, clink clink! Thank you everybody
for coming. I just wanted to say a
couple of words here.

NAME: Person_2
Why is Kumail here?

NAME: Person_4
Cause he was there the whole time. I
invited the nurses, I invited him.

NAME: Person_3
Emily, come on up here. I wanna say
something.

NAME: Person_3
Emily successfully peeled an orange
this morning.

NAME: Person_3
It was a clementine, full disclosure,
it's those little ones that a baby
monkey could peel, but she did it. And
that's all, thank you everybody.

NAME: Person_1
Hey. I like your cane. I've heard
pimpin' ain't easy.

NAME: Person_2
Right.

NAME: Person_1
Hey, can we talk for a second?

NAME: Person_2
Sure.

NAME: Person_1
So, I've been collecting some things
that are important to me and I wanted
to show them to you. I call this my bag
of devotion.

NAME: Person_1
This is all the visitor passes from
when I visited you when you were in the-

NAME: Person_1
These are the ticket stubs from when
your parents came to see me perform and
I realized how great they are, and how
great you are, and how great honesty
is.

NAME: Person_2
What did you do? Did you cremate
someone?

NAME: Person_1
These are the ashes of all the
Pakistani women - not the women - the
pictures of the Pakistani women. I
thought this was a good idea, but it
feels a little stupid.

NAME: Person_1
I know I was a terrible boyfriend. But
I've changed. And I am the person you
need me to be. I really am. So, will
you take me back?

NAME: Person_2
Kumail, I'm really glad that you went
through this experience, but you have
to understand that all that happened
while I was asleep. Like you felt one
way a few weeks ago and now you're
saying you feel the total opposite way
and the only thing that's changed is
that I was in a coma. Honestly, I look
at all of this, and I just think, I
can't do it again. I can't be the
reason that you don't have a family. It
just feels totally different now. And I
can't do that again. Do you understand?

NAME: Person_1
Okay.

NAME: Person_1
Ma. Dad. Fatima. Bhai. There's no
plate. Oh I forgot. I've decided I
won't let you kick me out of the
family. Since I am a member of the
family, it would stand to reason that I
would get a vote in whether or not I
get kicked out, and that vote would
have to be unanimous. Standard
parliamentary procedure. So all those
in favor of not kicking Kumail out of
the family, raise your hand.

NAME: Person_1
Great. Motion to kick Kumail out of the
family, denied. So you guys can just
talk to me.

NAME: Person_1
Okay, you're giving me the silent
treatment. I figured that was what was
going to happen. I have a solution.

NAME: Person_1
"Hi. How are you?" It's just a real
basic one. "Pass the salt." Practical.
"Always with the comedy." Mom, made
that one specially for you. "Kumail,
how did you become so much more
handsome than your brother Naveed?"

NAME: Person_8
Bullshit.

NAME: Person_1
I admit this one is designed to stir up
some controversy. "It's interesting how
you can't really kick someone out of your
family because they'll always be your
family." I agree with that one. It's a
good one. So, I'm gonna leave these here
for you.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry I lied about the girls and
the LSAT and all of that. That was
wrong. And one more thing: I'm moving
to New York to pursue stand-up, but I
am not leaving this family.

NAME: Person_2
What is it?

NAME: Person_2
Okay.

NAME: Person_2
I swear you and Dad are just like my
freshman year roommate, but instead of
boning random dudes, you're just
parenting all the time. All over the
place. In every room of the house.
Including right next to me.

NAME: Person_4
We gotta go.

NAME: Person_2
Home?

NAME: Person_2
No.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, it's time.

NAME: Person_2
I'm not ready.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, you know what? You're strong and
you are.

NAME: Person_1
And we'd go to the mosque and hear
graphic details of religious people
being killed 1400 years ago. I mean
like Tarantino-esque details. And
everyone would be crying, like
competing to see who could cry the
hardest. And I could never cry. And I
was like, what is wrong with me? Am I
broken?

NAME: Person_1
The only time I've cried that much is
when I watched the first 15 minutes of
Up. This is a picture of me and my
mother. I'm seven years old.

NAME: Person_3
You know people talk about New York
water but Chicago water is very
underrated, I think. It's good.

NAME: Person_2
Hey guys, I think I might just pop out
for a bit.

NAME: Person_3
By yourself?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, just hop around the block, maybe
get some frozen yogurt.

NAME: Person_3
Are you okay? Can you do it, can you walk
by yourself?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, Dad.

NAME: Person_4
Have fun.

NAME: Person_3
If you feel a coma coming on, call us.

NAME: Person_2
Dad, it's too soon. I love you, I'll see
you in the morning.

NAME: Person_3
Love you, bye.

NAME: Person_4
Have fun.

NAME: Person_2
I will.

NAME: Person_3
Got your phone?

NAME: Person_2
Yeah.

NAME: Person_1
But you liked it, huh?

NAME: Person_8
Yeah. I mean, yeah.

NAME: Person_1
Hey!

NAME: Person_2
Hi...

NAME: Person_1
What are you doing here?

NAME: Person_2
I was in the neighborhood and I saw
that you were gonna be here so I
thought I'd come say hi.

NAME: Person_1
You look great. How's your blood oxygen
level?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, well within range.

NAME: Person_1
Nice.

NAME: Person_1
Uh, this is my brother, Naveed.

NAME: Person_2
Hi, I'm Emily.

NAME: Person_8
I've heard lots about you.

NAME: Person_2
It's so good to finally meet you.
There's actually something I wanted to
tell you.

NAME: Person_8
Okay, well I'm going to just... goodbye.

NAME: Person_4
Are you warm enough?

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, yeah. I've got my two pairs of
socks on.

NAME: Person_4
Do you mind?

NAME: Person_3
No... no...

NAME: Person_4
I'm glad we're going home tomorrow.

NAME: Person_3
Me too. See? I should have brushed my
teeth.

NAME: Person_4
I like it.

NAME: Person_2
When something like this happens,
there's this sort of expectation that
you're going to have this completely
new lease on life and feel totally
different about everything. Like
cherish every sunrise. And for the most
part I just feel like, ugh I can't get
up that early. I'm sorry, I feel like
I've been talking about myself so much.
Are you doing a lot of stand-up?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, I bombed my Montreal Comedy
Festival audition, like horrifically.

NAME: Person_2
I saw the video. It wasn't great. I'll be
honest with you, it wasn't great.

NAME: Person_1
I know.

NAME: Person_2
But there was a lot I liked. Like a lot I
liked.

NAME: Person_1
I'm moving to New York.

NAME: Person_2
Really?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Mary and Person_6 and I are just gonna
drive out. We have a place already.

NAME: Person_2
When do you leave?

NAME: Person_1
Next weekend.

NAME: Person_2
I'm so excited for you. That is great.
I think you are going to do so great in
New York.

NAME: Person_1
What were you going to say?

NAME: Person_2
What?

NAME: Person_1
You said you were going to say something
to me. What was it?

NAME: Person_2
Oh, just that I wanted to thank you. My
parents told me everything you did for me
and I feel like the last time we spoke I
didn't properly thank you so-

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah. Totally fine.

NAME: Person_2
I should probably go.

NAME: Person_1
Do you wanna call an Uber?

NAME: Person_2
No, I'm gonna walk actually. This has
been really great. Okay, bye.

NAME: Person_5
The scene is gonna be so different with
you guys gone.

NAME: Person_1
You should... come out...

NAME: Person_5
Nah. I'm good here. I'm gonna miss you.

NAME: Person_1
I'm gonna miss you.

NAME: Person_5
Get out of here, you assholes.

NAME: Side_1
Come here, you big dummy.

NAME: Person_9
You are still kicked out of the family,
but because we did not get a proper
chance to say bye to you... Your mother
is so angry with you. She is not going
to get out of the car. She's not even
going to look at you. And I don't
believe you kept so much secret from
me, your father.

NAME: Person_1
I'm sorry.

NAME: Person_9
Here. She asked me to give this to you.

NAME: Person_9
Biryani. For your trip. Your favorite.
She made it herself specially for you
with extra potatoes.

NAME: Person_1
Thank you Ma.

NAME: Person_1
Is she okay?

NAME: Person_9
Right now? No.

NAME: Person_1
I'll miss you.

NAME: Person_9
I am forbidden from hugging you. So. It
was nice to have you as my son. Goodbye
forever. And do me a favor, when you
reach New York, just text us and tell
us that you've reached safely, okay?

NAME: Person_1
Dad, can I ask you something? When you
and Mom went on your first date, what
movie did you see?

NAME: Person_9
Satte pe Satta.

NAME: Person_9
Her favorite song. Why are you asking?

NAME: Person_1
Just curious.

NAME: Person_1
So the first time I came to America, I
was fourteen and I was just visiting my
uncle in New York and it just happened
to be Thanksgiving. On my first day in
America, my uncle took me to the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade and I was like,
this is every day in America! As
advertised. Every day they have a party
celebrating Garfield. No day has lived
up to that day. So I was lying to my
parents, I was telling them I was gonna
be a lawyer. And they're very
disappointed cause they wanted me to be
a doctor. And you guys are like, why
didn't you just tell them that you
wanted to be a doctor?

NAME: Person_1
It's a lie anyway. And I'm like, well it
has to be believable. If I told them I
want to be a doctor, they'd be like,
"bullshit." If I say lawyer, they're
like, "oh, ok, that's something." Cause
there's a strict hierarchy: doctor,
engineer, lawyer, hundreds of jobs,
ISIS, then comedian.

NAME: Person_1
Uhh. I'm sorry. It's very rude to
heckle comedians.

NAME: Person_2
Oh that wasn't a heckle. I just kind of
woo-hooed you.

NAME: Person_1
Well see that's a common misconception.
Heckling doesn't have to be negative.

NAME: Person_2
So if I was like, oh my god, you're
amazing in bed! That would be a heckle?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, and now you're getting more laughs
than me, and I don't like that. Do you
want to come up, do my job? Are you from
out of town, m'am?

NAME: Person_2
Chicago.

NAME: Person_1
Ooh Windy City. And what brings you to
New York?

NAME: Person_2
I'm here to see someone.

NAME: Person_1
And have you seen him? Or her, I mean I
don't know what your deal is.

NAME: Person_2
Yeah, I've seen him.

NAME: Person_6
Jeez... knock off the chatter, will
ya.

NAME: Person_1
Just trying to keep you awake, Arch.

NAME: Person_6
I'm awake! Where do you come up with
all that crap about women?

NAME: Person_1
It's true. Women are very complex,
but if you know how to read 'em...
they're an open book. You can always
tell the rotten apples from the
peaches.

NAME: Person_6
Are you kiddin'?

NAME: Person_1
I'd stake my career on it. Anybody
ever proves me wrong, I'll throw
away my badge.

NAME: Person_6
Aayyhh... women are trouble...

NAME: Person_1
I used to believe that too. Until I
married Lana. Now, she... is a peach.

NAME: Person_6
Yeah, well you're a lucky stiff,
pal. Ya hold down two jobs. Got a
beautiful wife waitin' for ya at
home. Everything a guy could ever
want, including NO kids.

NAME: Person_1
I'd love to have kids.

NAME: Person_6
What?! Rug-rats? Give me a break!
Jeez, I hate stakeouts. What makes
you think Milo's gonna show up here?

NAME: Person_1
Logic. He knocked off all those banks.
He's got cash. He's gonna want to
spend it. This is one of the few
places that still takes cash. Sooner
or later... he's gotta turn up.

NAME: Person_6
And how we s'posed to recognize this
scumbag?

NAME: Person_1
The "Support Hose Bandit"? When you
see him... you'll know him.

NAME: Person_6
These are the best damn Nachos in
North America. Maybe the world!

NAME: Person_6
I'm empty. I'm gonna get a refill.
You want some?

NAME: Person_2
Got a light?

NAME: Person_1
Sure.

NAME: Person_2
How about a match?

NAME: Person_1
No thanks. I have plenty.

NAME: Person_2
You really are incredibly stupid,
aren't you? I like that in a man.

NAME: Person_1
I'd be insulted, but I know you're
serious.

NAME: Person_2
You sound so sure of yourself.

NAME: Person_1
I'm not as dumb as I look.

NAME: Person_2
Let me buy you a drink, Mr. uh...

NAME: Person_1
Ravine. Ned Ravine. And you are...?

NAME: Person_2
Thirsty. What about that drink?

NAME: Person_1
I'm on duty.

NAME: Person_2
Brain surgeon?

NAME: Person_1
Cop.

NAME: Person_2
Oooo... and I bet you have a big
gun.

NAME: Person_1
You lose.

NAME: Person_2
If I can't buy you a drink...
...let me buy you one of those.

NAME: Person_1
Who can say no to a weiner?

NAME: Person_2
Not me.

NAME: Person_2
Two dogs. Hot.

NAME: Person_1
You come here often?

NAME: Person_2
Only when I'm in heat.

NAME: Person_1
Oh! Sorry.

NAME: Person_2
Where ya going?

NAME: Person_1
Get something to wipe it off.

NAME: Person_2
That's okay. You're doing just fine.

NAME: Person_1
I'll get you a wet paper towel.

NAME: Person_1
Hold it right there, Milo!

NAME: Side_18
Look out! He's got a weenie!

NAME: Person_1
Police emergency! I need your car!

NAME: Person_1
You take science in high school,
Milo?

NAME: Side_4
I skipped high school, cop!

NAME: Person_1
Then you're probably not familiar
with the theory of inverse
proportionate explosive dynamics.

NAME: Side_4
What about it?

NAME: Person_1
If you fire a weapon with the barrel
obstructed, the explosive force
multiplies by twenty-three point
five nine eight and reverses on itself
with diametric polarity?

NAME: Side_4
Yeah. So?

NAME: Person_1
The gun will blow up in your hand...
and it won't even scorch my pinkie.

NAME: Side_4
Ha! That's just theoretical
hypothesis. Inverse proportionate
explosive dynamics has never been
demonstrated conclusively in a
laboratory environment.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah. Then pull the trigger, smart
guy. Let's find out.

NAME: Person_1
You have the right to remain silent...
next... if you waive that right,
anything you say... next...

NAME: Person_1
...may be used against you in a court
of law... next... You have the right
to an attorney... Do you have an
attorney?

NAME: Side_4
Nahhhh!

NAME: Person_1
Then today's your lucky day...

NAME: Person_3
Not bad for an auto mechanic...

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, well you're not so bad
yourself... for a lawyer's wife...

NAME: Person_3
Better watch your tongue, sweetie,
or I'll have my husband arrest you.

NAME: Person_5
Busy man. Cop and a lawyer. When
does he ever find time for you?

NAME: Person_3
He doesn't. That's why I need you to
keep my engine tuned, Frank. Why
drive a jalopy when you can have a
hot rod?

NAME: Person_5
Maybe you should trade him in on a
new model.

NAME: Person_3
I would... if I could make any money
on the deal.

NAME: Person_5
Want to go for another test drive?

NAME: Person_3
Pull over and park it, Frank. I'm
still under warranty.

NAME: Person_1
Morning sweetheart.

NAME: Person_3
Uh huh. Want some coffee?

NAME: Person_1
No thanks.

NAME: Person_3
Frank here was just grabbing a little
before going back to work on my car.

NAME: Person_1
How long you been working on Lana's
Mercedes, Frank?

NAME: Person_5
Oh... I don't know... six, seven
weeks.

NAME: Person_1
And ya still haven't found the
problem?

NAME: Person_5
Think I got my finger on it though.

NAME: Person_1
I know what he's doing, Lana. I wasn't
born yesterday. He's not fixing your
car. He's SCREWING you!

NAME: Person_1
YOU are screwing my wife! I can see
what your game is, Frank. You open
up her hood, poke around in there...
squirt some lubrication in... play
around with all her parts... then
take an old used piston and stick it
in... then pull it out... in, out,
in, out! Every day! There's no end
to it. You just keep coming and
COMING!... and the bill just gets
bigger and BIGGER!

NAME: Person_1
But you don't see it, do you, Lana?
You're too good... too pure. You
can't see the evil in people like
him.
Well, you're not getting away with
it, pal. I'm pulling the plug! You're
fired!

NAME: Person_3
Ned... don't you have to be somewhere?

NAME: Person_1
Oh... yeah. Thanks, honey. I'm late
for court.

NAME: Person_1
You are so naive.

NAME: Person_1
Finish your coffee... then GET OUT!

NAME: Person_5
Who's that?

NAME: Person_3
Just the postman. He always rings
twice.

NAME: Person_1
Laura... do you know where...?

NAME: Person_4
Right here. The judge decided to
skip arraignment and take Milo direct
to trial. You're six minutes late,
but don't sweat it. You got Judge
Allen. He's always eleven minutes
late.

NAME: Person_4
I suggest you try Lemming versus
Florida, 1956... where the guy jumped
in the water and everybody followed.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Good idea.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know what I'd do without
you?

NAME: Person_4
Really?

NAME: Person_1
Laura, how long have you worked for
me?

NAME: Person_4
Two years, seven months, twenty-three
days, nineteen hours...
...six minutes and fifty-two seconds.
...fifty-three... fifty-four... fifty-
five... fifty-six...

NAME: Person_1
And when was the last time I gave
you a raise?

NAME: Person_4
Never. But that's okay. I don't need
a raise. In fact... I was thinking
of giving you a rebate on my salary.

NAME: Person_1
Naw. That's okay. You keep it.

NAME: Person_4'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

NAME: Person_4'S HUSBAND
Did we forget something?

NAME: Person_1
Laura. Laura! What is it?

NAME: Person_4
I'm okay, I'm okay. I just get a
bit... claustrophobic... in the
bathroom.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe we should try some prune juice.

NAME: Person_4
Wear the blue one.

NAME: Person_1
Ladies and gentlemen... I ask you...
does this look like the face of a
crook?

NAME: Person_1
Of course it does. But the question
of my client's guilt or innocence is
not the issue here today. I'm certain
every member of the jury can clearly
see that he's guilty!

NAME: Side_19
I can't.

NAME: Person_1
Put yourself in his shoes. Look
through his eyes. See the world the
way HE sees it!

NAME: Person_1
Things just don't look the same.
It's fuzzy... and frightening!

NAME: Person_1
Ladies and gentlemen... Milo Crumley
is not the perpetrator here. He is
the VICTIM!

NAME: Person_1
Like ALL of us... this man is the
unfortunate victim of these tragically
difficult economic times. And what
does that mean? He can't support his
family!

NAME: Person_1
For God's sake!... He can't even
support his own FACE!

NAME: Side_1
Mr. Crumley... you cannot chew gum
in my courtroom... unless you have
enough for everyone.

NAME: Side_1
Bailiff. Pass these out.

NAME: Side_1
And don't forget the jury.

NAME: Person_1
And so, desperate and broke, with no
other options before him, Mr. Crumley
went to eleven Savings & Loans and
did what any of you would have done.
He stole back the money that the
S&Ls had stolen from him!

NAME: Side_1
Mr. Ravine... please approach the
bench.

NAME: Side_1
You're not running for congress here,
so knock off the speeches and quit
inciting these brainless morons! Now
pick up the pace and wrap this son-
of-a-bitch up! Call your first
witness.

NAME: Person_1
I call... Detective Ned Ravine.

NAME: Side_6
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

NAME: Person_1
I do.

NAME: Person_1
Detective Ravine, at the time of the
arrest, did you read the defendant
his Miranda rights?

NAME: Person_1
Of course. That's standard procedure.

NAME: Person_1
Are these the cards Officer Brooks
used to prompt you while reading Mr.
Crumley his rights?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. These are them.

NAME: Person_1
Reading from the cards now... quote
"You have the right to remain silent,
if you waive that right, anything
you say... may be used against you
in a court of law." Is that right?

NAME: Person_1
That's right.

NAME: Person_1
WRONG! The official Miranda warning
is... "anything you say CAN be used
against you in a court of law." Not
"may"... "CAN!"
Don't you know the difference between
"can" and "may", Detective? Every
school kid knows "can" is a verb
that indicates ability to perform,
while "may" is a verbal auxiliary
indicating the permission to act.

NAME: Person_1
I didn't have time to worry about
past participles or interrogative
pronouns! I was trying to protect
society from a deranged MADMAN!
But this ivy league fop...!!!

NAME: Person_1
I have no more use for this witness.

NAME: Side_1
Mr. Ravine...

NAME: Side_1
I'm dismissing this case on the
grounds of improper grammar.

NAME: Person_1
Ow!

NAME: Side_7
But your Honor...!

NAME: Side_1
I know, I know. It's a technicality.
But it's the kind of technicality
that makes the American legal system
what it is today! Court's adjourned!

NAME: Person_2
I waited. You never came back.

NAME: Person_1
I got busy. Here's that paper towel
I promised.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks...

NAME: Person_1
How'd you get in? The door was locked.

NAME: Person_2
It's miraculous what a real woman
can do... with a bobbie pin.

NAME: Person_2
Cigarette?

NAME: Person_1
No... thanks. They're bad for ya.

NAME: Person_2
Yes, I know. I like things that are
bad for me.
So... I hear you go both ways.

NAME: Person_1
Only once. It was a fraternity prank.
I never saw him again.

NAME: Person_2
No, I mean... you're a cop and a
lawyer.

NAME: Person_1
Oh. Yeah. Well, there's a lot of
scum out there on the streets... but
they all deserve a fair and costly
trial.

NAME: Person_4
I'll get that.

NAME: Person_1
Oh... Laura... this is, uh...

NAME: Person_2
Lola Cain.

NAME: Person_2
So lovely to meet you, Laura.

NAME: Person_1
Gotta keep these darn books in their
right place or we'll never find the
ones we need. Let's see, Q thru M...
R thru B... W thru F...

NAME: Person_4
It's getting late. I'll give you a
ride home, Ned.

NAME: Person_1
I have my car.

NAME: Person_4
I'll tow you.

NAME: Person_1
Not today. You don't need to wait.
I'll see you tomorrow.

NAME: Person_4
I should call someone to fix this...

NAME: Person_1
Tomorrow...

NAME: Person_4
I'll call from home.

NAME: Person_2
I think I should warn you, Mr.
Ravine... I'm not wearing any
underwear.

NAME: Person_1
Try these on.

NAME: Person_1
So... what can I do for you?

NAME: Person_2
I've run across some... papers...
and I thought you might be able to
tell me what they are. You see, I'm
not very experienced when it comes
to... papers.

NAME: Person_1
I'll help you Miss Cain, if I'm able.
Do you have the... papers... here?

NAME: Person_2
No... they're at home. I thought you
might stop by...

NAME: Person_1
I'm on duty tonight.

NAME: Person_2
Don't they ever give you a night
off?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Tomorrow.

NAME: Person_2
Why don't we meet tomorrow evening
then?

NAME: Person_2
I'll let you know where.

NAME: Person_1
What's wrong with my office?

NAME: Person_2
Nothing a good interior decorator
couldn't fix.

NAME: Person_2
Take care of this for me, will ya?

NAME: Person_5
I came back for my shower cap.

NAME: Person_3
Yeah, well you came to the right
place.

NAME: Person_3
Sit down.

NAME: Person_5
Where is he?

NAME: Person_3
On duty all night. By the time he
wraps up his reports, it'll be close
to noon tomorrow.

NAME: Person_3
I was just reading over...

NAME: Person_3
Take off the hat, Frank.

NAME: Person_3
I was just reading over my husband's
insurance policies. You wouldn't
know anything about insurance, would
you, Frankie?

NAME: Person_5
Yeah, matter of fact, I sell policies
part-time. I got half a brain... or
didn't you notice?

NAME: Person_3
I musta had my eye on something else.
How about a translation.

NAME: Person_5
Standard accident policy... all the
usual stuff... blah, blah, blah. The
face value is... Wow. Not bad. Three
million bucks!
And there's a triple indemnity rider.

NAME: Person_3
Meaning?

NAME: Person_5
Aw, it's just something agents throw
in so we can boost the premium. If
the policy holder dies under very
specific conditions, it pays off
three times the face value of the
policy.

NAME: Person_3
Nine million dollars...?

NAME: Person_5
Yeah... but it's a sure bet for the
company. Nobody ever collects.

NAME: Person_3
Why not?

NAME: Person_5
Well, like here... it only pays off
if he's shot with a pistol, falls
from a moving northbound train and
drowns in a fresh water stream.

NAME: Person_3
All three?

NAME: Person_5
See what I mean, sweetheart? What
are the odds of that?

NAME: Person_3
It could happen.
Suppose it did happen?

NAME: Person_5
Then you'd be rich.

NAME: Person_3
Then we'd be rich.

NAME: Person_5
What're you sayin'...?

NAME: Person_3
We're gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch!
And I know exactly how! He has a
legal symposium in Santa Barbara
this weekend... All we have to do is
get him to take the train up instead
of driving.

NAME: Person_5
How we gonna do that? Didn't you
tell me he hates trains?

NAME: Person_3
That's where you come in, baby. You're
gonna rig his car so it doesn't work.
That should be no problem for you.

NAME: Person_3
Then... we give him a lift to the
train station... through Dealey Plaza,
past the Book Suppository and around
the grassy knoll...

NAME: Person_5
Isn't that out of our way?

NAME: Person_3
Move, Frank.

NAME: Person_3
And pay attention.

NAME: Person_3
Ten minutes out of the station he'll
be standing in the vestibule between
cars... trying to avoid a panic
attack. Fourteen minutes and ten
seconds out, the train crosses the
Santa Ynez River. So at thirteen
minutes and fifty-four seconds, I
shoot him, shove him out the door...
he hits the river and drowns. Bingo!
A triple play. We're rich!

NAME: Person_5
You been thinking about this a lot,
haven't you?

NAME: Person_3
No. It just came to me.
I had this image of a big, powerful,
throbbing train... plunging into a
long, dark, wet tunnel.

NAME: Person_1
Stand over there and shut up!

NAME: Person_1
Watch your mouth, punk! I don't want
to hear language like that!

NAME: Person_6
Whoa, hold on, hoss! Take it easy.
You seem a little tense tonight.
What is it?

NAME: Person_1
Aw... I don't know. I guess it's
Lana. It's just... I know she wants
to have a baby so bad...

NAME: Person_1
...but I never get to spend any time
with her. And when I am home... it's
like she's, you know... avoiding
sex.

NAME: Person_1
That can't be it. I'm the tenderest
guy on the force. Nah... I think
she's just afraid she won't be able
to get pregnant.

NAME: Person_6
What's to be afraid! It's like making
breakfast! You bring home the bacon...
she's got the eggs. Ya scramble it
up. Ba-da-boom ba-da-bing! She's got
an omelette in the oven!
Why don't you knock off early... go
home. It'd be nice for Lana to wake
up in the morning and find you there
for a change.

NAME: Person_1
Naw... I can't. I got all this
paperwork.

NAME: Person_6
Don't worry about that.

NAME: Side_20
Yeah! We'll fill out all that shit.

NAME: Side_21
...and Mrs. Prudy Ann Camomile of
Delphi, Georgia is one-hundred and
thirteen! What a gorgeous hunk of
female! Smokes three cigars a day,
drinks a straight shot of vodka at
bedtime... and still has sex!

NAME: Person_1
Damn birds!

NAME: Person_4
My God, Ned... you look like you
were hit by a bus.

NAME: Person_1
I was.
Who's in my office?

NAME: Person_4
Max Shady's mother.

NAME: Person_1
Not again.

NAME: Person_1
Hello, Mrs. Shady.

NAME: Person_1
Laura... check on my insurance. Make
sure it's paid up.

NAME: Person_7
Good idea, Mr. Ravine. My son, Max,
is getting out of prison tomorrow.

NAME: Person_1
Gee, has it been seven years already?

NAME: Person_7
Seven long, miserable years in the
slammer. And he's a bit pissed off.

NAME: Person_1
Well, being locked in a tiny room
with no TV can make a guy feel pretty
tense.

NAME: Person_7
I'm very concerned about him, Mr.
Ravine. He said you were a two-bit
shyster... and he's going to rip
your head off and use it for a bowling
ball!

NAME: Person_1
I'm sure the experience wasn't all
negative. He probably made a lot of
friends...

NAME: Person_7
You think?

NAME: Person_1
...learned a useful trade...

NAME: Person_7
Oh yes... live autopsies...

NAME: Person_1
...caught up on all those books he
wanted to read...

NAME: Person_7
Maybe so... but he said he's going
to punch you in the testicles...

NAME: Person_7
...smash your face...

NAME: Person_7
...and decimate your wardrobe.

NAME: Person_7
And I wouldn't want that to happen.
He's a naughty naughty boy. I just
thought I should warn you.

NAME: Person_7
Bye for now.
Oh... may I have a cookie?

NAME: Person_4
Sure.

NAME: Person_7
Thank yooooooooou.

NAME: Person_4
Oh my God, Ned.

NAME: Person_1
I hate when she comes to see me.

NAME: Person_4
Don't you realize, Ned?... you could
be in real danger.

NAME: Person_1
What's that?

NAME: Person_4
Extreme peril. You know, the risk of
personal bodily harm.

NAME: Person_1
No... I mean that.

NAME: Person_4
Your insurance file. But the policy's
missing. Did you take it home?

NAME: Person_1
I don't think so.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, wait a second...

NAME: Person_4'S HUSBAND
Lau-raaaaa!

NAME: Person_1
Laura! Are you alright? That was a
very long flashback you had.

NAME: Person_4
Yes... I know. It's okay. I'm just a
little... pre-menstrual.

NAME: Person_4
That Lola Cain... "person"... stopped
by. She left this!

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah, before I forget... you asked
me to take care of this.

NAME: Person_2
Thanks...

NAME: Person_1
You smoke too much.
It's hot tonight.

NAME: Person_2
Is it? I never know. My body heat
runs about twenty degrees above
normal.

NAME: Person_1
Maybe we should look for a cooler
place.

NAME: Person_2
I doubt we'll find one. Even the
wind chimes on my porch aren't moving
much these days. They keep thudding
softly, like dairy cows bumping butts
in the night. I go out there expecting
to find a cool breeze... but it's
just a lot of hot air.

NAME: Person_1
What're they lookin' at?

NAME: Person_2
A lot of them have tried that seat.
You're the first one's lasted this
long.

NAME: Person_1
I feel honored.

NAME: Person_2
Don't. It's broken.

NAME: Person_1
Did you bring the... papers?

NAME: Person_2
No. I thought you might come over...

NAME: Person_1
Sure. I'll drive you.

NAME: Person_2
I brought my own car.

NAME: Person_1
I'll follow you then.

NAME: Person_2
I know it sounds silly, but would
you leave first... wait in your car?
I come here a lot and I wouldn't
want those men to think I'm "easy"...
a slut who'll jump into bed with
anyone at the drop of a hat. But if
you leave first...

NAME: Person_1
...they'll think I'm a putz for
passing up a sure thing.

NAME: Person_2
Now leave me alone!

NAME: Person_1
Well, here we are... in the dark.

NAME: Person_2
I have The Clapper.

NAME: Person_1
You what?

NAME: Person_2
My wind chimes.

NAME: Person_1
You know, these would work a lot
better if you took them out of the
boxes.

NAME: Person_2
Well well... I guess you have been
around. I'm impressed.

NAME: Person_1
Why don't we take a look at those...
papers?

NAME: Person_2
Papers. Right.

NAME: Person_1
That's it? These are the... papers?

NAME: Person_2
Yes. They're so confusing to me. Can
you tell me what they are?

NAME: Person_1
This one's a laundry receipt... and
the other one's an expired lottery
ticket.

NAME: Person_2
No. You keep them... as a memento of
our time together.

NAME: Person_2
I'm so grateful. How can I ever repay
you for all you've done?

NAME: Person_1
Cash would be nice.

NAME: Person_2
Isn't there some other way?

NAME: Person_1
I suppose you could wash my car.

NAME: Person_2
No, I mean, isn't there something
else you want? Something I could
give you?

NAME: Person_1
Hey... slow down... there's a speed
limit in this state. Sixty-five miles
an hour.

NAME: Person_2
How fast was I going, officer?

NAME: Person_1
Oh, about a hundred and twenty-three.

NAME: Person_2
Suppose you pull me over and frisk
me?

NAME: Person_1
Suppose I let you off with a warning?

NAME: Person_2
Suppose I find a cop with a bigger
nightstick?

NAME: Person_1
Suppose I put you under arrest for
being a bad girl with bad thoughts?

NAME: Person_2
Suppose you handcuff me to the bed?

NAME: Person_1
Suppose I do and then we lose the
key and while I'm gone to get a
duplicate made the house catches on
fire and I can't get back to save
you because the bridge is washed out
and so you die a horrible death
toasted like a Polish sausage on a
flaming spit!
Nah... I better be going.

NAME: Person_2
You're not so tough. Last chance.

NAME: Person_1
No thanks. I got a cold shower and a
wife who trusts me waiting at home.

NAME: Person_2
What's the matter? Don't you want
me? It's the way I look, isn't it?

NAME: Person_1
Don't forget to lock up.

NAME: Person_2
I knew you'd come back...

NAME: Person_1
I forgot my car keys.

NAME: Person_2
That's not what you came back for.

NAME: Person_1
Yes it is.

NAME: Person_2
...don't... stop...

NAME: Person_2
...Oh Ned... please... don't...
stop...

NAME: Person_2
That takes care of foreplay.

NAME: Side_22
It's time, Max.

NAME: Person_9 SHADY
Find Ned Ravine... rip his head off
and use it for a bowling ball!

NAME: Person_9 SHADY
Yeah. The bastard gave it to me as a
gift... to make up for losing my
case. Now I'm going to wear it to
his friggin' funeral!!

NAME: Person_9 SHADY
Ma!

NAME: Person_1
That's Madam Butterfly, isn't it?

NAME: Person_2
Iron Butterfly. In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.

NAME: Person_1
Oh yeah, sure... now I can hear it.

NAME: Person_2
It tells the sad story of a woman
who is rejected by her lover after a
brief, but torrid, affair... so she
stalks him with an ice pick and stabs
him with it more than a thousand
times.

NAME: Person_1
Really? I never could understand the
lyrics.

NAME: Person_1
You know, what happened last night
was very, uh...

NAME: Person_2
Yes... it was. I should check on my
homeowners insurance.

NAME: Person_1
But we can't ever let it happen again.
Ever!

NAME: Person_2
What are you saying, Ned? That you're
rejecting me, your lover, after a
brief, but torrid, affair?!

NAME: Person_1
I wouldn't put it exactly like that.
It's just that... well, I'm married
to a wonderful woman... who is very,
very attractive...
...not that you aren't very
attractive!

NAME: Person_1
...you aren't very attractive... you
aren't very attractive... you aren't
very attractive...

NAME: Side_3
Don't touch anything. You bond with
it... you buy it. Whatdya want?

NAME: Person_1
I'd like to buy a pet.

NAME: Side_3
Yeah. For what purpose?

NAME: Person_1
It's a gift... for my wife.

NAME: Side_3
Right. They all say that.

NAME: Person_1
She spends a lot of time alone. I
thought it might be nice if she had
something to keep her company.

NAME: Side_3
Yeah. Sure. I bet. How do I know
you're not the kind of guy who punches
out parakeets? Or takes some poor
defenseless animal, throws it in a
sack and runs over it with your car
five or six times.

NAME: Person_1
I would never hurt an animal.

NAME: Side_3
Boy, I would. They're driving me

NAME: Side_3
Shuddup!

NAME: Side_3
Okay... tell me more about this broad
you're married to. I like to match
people with the pets they deserve.

NAME: Person_6
Uh-uh.

NAME: Person_1
You do all my paperwork?

NAME: Person_1
Get out of here.

NAME: Person_6
And a damn good job, too. One of 'em
even did it in Spanish.

NAME: Person_6
Hey Ned! Catch this! Friend of yours.

NAME: Person_6
Jesus... you hear that?

NAME: Person_1
He's just working through his anger,
trying to find a constructive outlet.

NAME: Person_6
Are you kiddin'! He'll do it! The
guy's a friggin' looney!

NAME: Person_1
Trust me, I spent a lot of time with
him when I was preparing his case.
He's really a very sweet, sensitive
human being.

NAME: Person_9
I'd like to mash his head like a
ripe melon...

NAME: Person_1
He gets a little melon-dramatic.

NAME: Person_9
...then cut off all his fingers and
rip out his liver with my teeth!

NAME: Person_1
See. Loves to exaggerate.

NAME: Person_6
Christ, Ned... you're in deep shit.

NAME: Person_1
Lieutenant Ravine.

NAME: Person_2
I want to see you, Ned.

NAME: Person_1
I told you not to call me! It's
finished between us. No. No, I'm not
sucking anything of yours anymore!
It's done! OVER!

NAME: Person_1
Wrong number.

NAME: Person_5
How come we gotta meet here?

NAME: Person_3
We have to be careful now. We can't
risk being seen together at the house
or someone might connect us to the
murder later on.

NAME: Person_3
Here... put this on.

NAME: Person_3
Speak Yiddish.

NAME: Person_5
What?

NAME: Person_3
Red Yiddish.

NAME: Person_5
Ich hobe getracht, efsher iz der
nisht geshtoigen un nisht gefloygen.
(I been thinkin'...
maybe this plan is
too complicated.)

NAME: Person_3
Zein nisht azoy meshige! Der plan iz

(Quit worrying. The
plan is perfect.)

NAME: Person_5
Yo! Ober mir darfen imvarfen in tsug.
Un schissen un schtippen in vasser
arein. Oy a broch! Mir zenen git

(Yeah, but we gotta
get him on the train,
shoot him... then
push him in the river.
There's a million
ways we can screw
up.)

NAME: Person_3
Vus iz mit idr? Die host a vaichen

(You're not going
soft on me, are you?)

NAME: Person_5
Ven hob ich gehat a vaichen schmoke?
(When have I ever
gone soft on you?)

NAME: Person_3
Lest'n Yomkippur.

NAME: Person_5
Nu shoin, ein mul. Es paseert tsie

(Okay... once! It
happens to every
guy.)

NAME: Person_5
Oy! Mir vellen zein oif groise tsures.
Me'vet unz chap'n.
(We're going to be in
big trouble. They're
going to catch us.)

NAME: Side_14
There's very little risk involved.
Statistics reveal that less than
thirty-two percent of all murderers
are ever apprehended.

NAME: Person_3
You speak Yiddish?

NAME: Side_14
No. But I can read sub-titles.

NAME: Side_23
Oy vay!

NAME: Person_4
Oh gee, you shouldn't have...

NAME: Person_1
I didn't. It's for my wife.

NAME: Person_4
She called. Wondered why you never
came home last night. I told her you
were working with a client,
undercover.

NAME: Person_4
Were you?

NAME: Person_1
What?

NAME: Person_4
There's lipstick on your collar.

NAME: Person_1
No there isn't.

NAME: Person_4
No... there isn't. But you answered
my question. She's a real looker,
huh?

NAME: Person_1
Who?

NAME: Person_4
Lola Cain.

NAME: Person_1
I hadn't noticed.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah, I noticed how you hadn't
noticed.
That's alright. She noticed enough
for both of us.

NAME: Person_4
I worry about you, Ned. I worry a
lot.
Max Shady's been faxing death threats
to you all morning.

NAME: Person_1
...stick a knife in your...
...rip the eyeballs out of your...
...drive razor-sharp spikes under
your...

NAME: Person_4
Did you get to the one...?

NAME: Person_1
...cut it off... shove it in a
blender.

NAME: Person_4
Yeah... that one.

NAME: Person_1
He's just getting it out of his
system. Once they say it... they
never do it. You know... like the
President.

NAME: Person_4
Wait. It might be him.

NAME: Person_1
Where did you get that?

NAME: Person_4
From my purse.

NAME: Person_1
What are you doing with it?

NAME: Person_4
Handing it to you.

NAME: Person_1
Jeez, Laura, what do you use a gun
for?

NAME: Person_4
You shoot it. A bullet comes out.
Gosh, Ned, after all your years as a
cop, I'd think you'd know these
things.

NAME: Person_1
Laura... put the gun away.

NAME: Side_24
Flowers for Ned Rav...
Hey... aren't you that lawyer guy?
Man, you are dead meat!

NAME: Person_4
Is this another sick joke from Max
Shady?

NAME: Person_1
What is it...?

NAME: Person_4
Lola Cain.

NAME: Person_4
I'll put these in water for you.

NAME: Person_2'S VOICE
Ned, darling... I know this seems
like a strange way to talk with you...
but since you won't take my calls, I
have no other choice.
Watch it! That red car's turning
left!

NAME: Person_2'S VOICE
I love you, Ned. We're meant to be
together... forever.
The light's changing! Floor it! Go!
Go! Go!

NAME: Person_2'S VOICE
Nice move!
Nothing can keep us apart, Ned. Not
even your wife. I'd hate to have to
tell her about us, but if necessary...
I will.

NAME: Person_3
What happened to you last night?

NAME: Person_1
Why? What have you heard?

NAME: Person_3
You could have called. But then, I
suppose you were tied up.

NAME: Person_1
Only part of the time.

NAME: Person_3
I never know when you're coming home,
Ned. How can I ever make any plans?

NAME: Person_1
I promise I'll spend more time with
you. I know it's been rough, being
alone so much. But I'll make it up
to you. Maybe we should try again,
you know... to have a baby.

NAME: Person_3
So what's in the box?

NAME: Person_1
Oh... I brought you a present!

NAME: Person_3
What is it?

NAME: Person_1
It's... sorta like a cat.

NAME: Person_3
Not enough like a cat.

NAME: Person_1
It's a little skunk. I got it at
Birds-and-Skunks-R-Us.

NAME: Person_1
So... what're you going to name him?

NAME: Person_3
How about... Ned?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Got a nice ring to it. I've
always liked the name Ned.

NAME: Person_3
No kidding.

NAME: Person_1
So whatdya think? You love Ned Junior
as much as you love me?

NAME: Person_3
At least.

NAME: Person_3
Hello?... Hello?... Hello?
Frank? Is that you?

NAME: Person_3
I told you not to call. Frank? Person_5!

NAME: Person_2
Who's Frank?

NAME: Person_1
Frank? The only Frank I know is an
auto mechanic... but I sure as hell
wouldn't recommend the guy. He's
really slow.

NAME: Person_2
I had to see you, Ned. I need to
feel your arms around me! I wanna
suck your toes til the nails pop
off!

NAME: Person_1
I told you, what happened was a big
mistake. A one night stand. It's
over. I have a wife...

NAME: Person_2
It doesn't matter. She'll know all
about us soon anyway. I want YOU! In
my bed... in my arms... in MEEEEEEE!

NAME: Person_2
I got us tickets to see Iron
Butterfly!

NAME: Person_1
I hate opera!

NAME: Person_2
Why are you running from me? Didn't
it mean ANYTHING to you?... buffing
my buns with carnuba wax?
Come on, Neddy-poo. Doesn't Mr. Pokey
want to go exploring?

NAME: Person_1
He's busy right now.

NAME: Person_1
Look, I told you... Mr. Pokey made a
big mistake! One lousy mistake in
his whole stinkin' life! So why don't
you give him a BREAK! Besides... he
belongs to my wife!

NAME: Side_15
I'd like to congratulate Mr. Pokey
for setting yet another unusual legal
precedent. This is the first time
I've ever tried a case in which the
JURY was found to be insane.

NAME: Side_6
What're you? A thirty-eight long?

NAME: Side_15
The jury will be remanded to the
Center For Unclear Thinking in Simi
Valley. Court's adjourned.

NAME: Person_1
Your BIRTHDAY! Today? Why didn't you
tell me?

NAME: Person_4
It's not important. I just had one
last year.

NAME: Person_1
Well, I'm taking you out to celebrate!

NAME: Person_4
Oh no no! It's no big thing. I'll
have another one sometime.

NAME: Person_1
I insist. And I want to get you a
nice present.

NAME: Person_4
You're so sweet. You don't have to.
You gave me a present last year.
Those lovely Ginzu knives.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah... aren't they great! They last
forever. And you can cut right through
a shoe with 'em!

NAME: Person_1
It's nice to be off the streets...
away from all the pain and misery
out there.

NAME: Person_4
Oh, uh... I just wanted to remind
you about...

NAME: Person_1
...the Legal Symposium...

NAME: Person_4
...in Santa Barbara...

NAME: Person_1
...tomorrow...

NAME: Person_1 & Person_4
..."How To Sue Your Loved Ones."

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I'm driving up in the morning.

NAME: Person_4
What is it, Ned? You can tell me.

NAME: Person_1
I'm a man, Laura. And all men feel
passion at one time or another. Even
me.

NAME: Person_4
Really?

NAME: Person_1
What would you think of a married
man who gave in to those wild,
sensual, raging desires?

NAME: Person_4
Oh... wow... golly...

NAME: Person_1
What if, for just one crazy moment,
he couldn't resist...? He got knocked
for a loop and lost control?

NAME: Person_4
Gosh... that might be okay.

NAME: Person_1
What if a tidal wave of lust crashed
over him and he was sucked into a
vortex of wild, thrashing urges?

NAME: Person_1
Well... it's not your problem. I'll
work it out.

NAME: Person_2
Like some ice for your drink?

NAME: Person_2
Does your wife know you're...
"working" late? I certainly hope so,
Mr. Ravine.

NAME: Person_3
Hurry up, darling. You'll be late!

NAME: Person_5
It's all taken care of. When do I
knock on the door?

NAME: Person_3
Wait until I signal you. When I raise
the blinds... you knock.

NAME: Person_3
Not now!

NAME: Person_5
Oh, later... right... okay.

NAME: Person_3
Drive carefully, sweetheart. Say bye-
bye to Little Ned. He loves his
daddy... don't you Stink Pot?

NAME: Person_1
See you tonight, Junior.

NAME: Person_3
What's wrong?

NAME: Person_1
This neighborhood is getting worse
all the time! Damn kids stole my
engine!

NAME: Person_3
Why don't you catch the train to
Santa Barbara? It leaves in twenty
minutes.

NAME: Person_1
I'll just fly up.

NAME: Person_3
No!

NAME: Person_3
I mean... you can't. Armed terrorists
seized the airport this morning. A
plane crashed into the tower... and
all the runways are on fire!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. So?

NAME: Person_3
And it's fogged in.

NAME: Person_1
Dammit.

NAME: Person_3
For my peace of mind... take the
train.

NAME: Person_1
I can't do it. You know how I feel
about riding trains.

NAME: Person_3
Darling... it's only a short trip.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah... right. A short trip.

NAME: Person_1
A short trip to hell in a metal tomb!

NAME: Person_3
Just because both your parents died
in a train wreck...

NAME: Person_1
And my brother, Jeff...

NAME: Person_3
And your brother, Morty...

NAME: Person_1
My two sisters...

NAME: Person_3
Right...

NAME: Person_1
My best friend, Al... my dog, Woof...
Grandma Rose... and Uncle Lionel.
All killed by trains!

NAME: Person_3
Coincidence, Ned. Beside... that's
the past. They're gone.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. I guess I can't bring them
back by not riding on a train.

NAME: Person_3
That's right.

NAME: Person_1
But I just can't get over this stupid
nagging fear that...

NAME: Person_3
Fear! What about our baby, Ned? I
don't want to raise a child in a
home filled with fear!

NAME: Person_3
But if you can conquer your fear...
maybe I can conquer my fear of having
a baby with a father who's fearful.
Ned... don't let a train kill our
child before it's even conceived!

NAME: Person_1
I guess you're right.

NAME: Person_3
You're sure now...?

NAME: Person_1
But we'll never make it to the
station. By the time a cab gets
here...

NAME: Person_5
I was in the neighborhood. Thought
I'd stop by and pick up my tools.

NAME: Person_3
Frank will drive you. Won't you Frank?

NAME: Person_5
Sure, I'll take you to the train
station.

NAME: Person_1
Twelve minutes. We'll never make it.

NAME: Person_1
We're not going to make it.

NAME: Person_5
We'll make it!

NAME: Person_3
Okay... now what're you going to do
if you feel queasy going through the
tunnel?

NAME: Person_1
I'll stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

NAME: Person_3
That's right. When you get queasy...
go stand in the vestibule between
the cars.

NAME: Side_26
OH! My dear gracious!

NAME: Side_9
SIR! Would you PLEASE extinguish
that foul smelling cigar?

NAME: Person_9
You want me to put out my CIGAR? YOU
want me to put out my cigar? You
want ME to put out my CIGAR?

NAME: Side_9
Yeah.

NAME: Person_9
Certainly.

NAME: Person_3
It's already getting to him. He'll
be out of that seat and into the
vestibule within ten minutes... I
guarantee it.

NAME: Person_9
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to
ME? You... talkin'... to... ME?

NAME: Side_10
Ticket?

NAME: Side_10
Sorry pal... automatic weapons are
only allowed in the club car after
nine p.m.

NAME: Side_10
I'll check it with baggage. You can
claim it at the depot in Santa
Barbara.

NAME: Side_2
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?
No kiddin'! You ever been in a wreck?
My uncle has. Lotsa times. It's really
neat. Everybody gets creamed! All
bloody guts... heads ripped off and
stuff... Hey... wanna hear my song
"Great Green Gobs of Greasy Grimy
Gopher Guts"?

NAME: Person_3
You want to earn a couple bucks,
kid?

NAME: Side_2
Hi! I'm Jeff and I'm eight years
old. Didja know if ya put a penny on
the track it'll make the train crash?

NAME: Person_3
He's losing it. You better get up to
the next car. Remember, give me the
high sign as soon as you see the
river. It'll be two minutes and nine
seconds past the tunnel. I'll take
care of the rest. Anything goes
wrong... just make sure you back me
up.
And don't let him see you.

NAME: Person_1
This... is not a toy!

NAME: Side_2
Yes it is.

NAME: Person_9
Here... let me help you with that.

NAME: Side_27
What a nice young man. You are so
polite.

NAME: Person_9
I try to be.

NAME: Side_2
Great green gobs of greasy, grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... chopped up dirty birdie's
feet... one pint jar of all-purpose
porpoise pus... cooked in a Mulligan
stew.

NAME: Side_2
French fried eyeballs and ugly scabs
you wanna pick... stuff to make your
mother sick... dog poop on a stick...
puke and snot all mixed together in
a pot...

NAME: Side_2
Oh boy! Here comes the tunnel!

NAME: Person_3
Way to go, Ned. Right on time.

NAME: Person_9
You shootin' at me?

NAME: Person_9
Yeah... you're definitely shootin'
at me.

NAME: Person_1
In this crazy world, there's not a
whole lot a guy can count on. But
when the chips are down, I can always
count on you.

NAME: Person_1
You risked your life to save mine. A
guy can't ask any more from a woman
than that.

NAME: Person_1
But I saw you shoot him, Lana. In
cold blood. I gotta arrest you for
murder.

NAME: Person_3
Ned... you wouldn't...

NAME: Person_1
Sorry. I'm a cop. I have a job to
do.

NAME: Person_3
But... you said it yourself. I saved
your life.

NAME: Person_1
Don't worry, baby. I know a good
lawyer.

NAME: Person_1
That's a question for the arresting
officer.

NAME: Person_1
You'll have to ask her attorney.

NAME: Person_1
Only her husband can answer that.

NAME: Person_1
A lovely powder blue dress with a
cinch waist, full bodice and a
delicately pleated skirt.

NAME: Person_1
No comment.

NAME: Person_1
I said... NO COMMENT!

NAME: Person_1
Jeez... they're really throwing some
tough questions out there today.

NAME: Person_4
They're just doing their job.

NAME: Person_1
Yeah... well I call it a "high-tech
lynching of an uppity white
housewife."

NAME: Person_1
What's this?

NAME: Person_6
Only cell available. They had that
serial killer locked up here... you
know, the one who talks his victims
to death then eats them... Hannibal
the Lecturer. But they let him out
for a three week tour to publicize
his new book.

NAME: Person_1
"To Serve Man."

NAME: Person_6
It's a cookbook.

NAME: Person_6
And look, look... he autographed it.

NAME: Person_1
To Arch... Love to have you for dinner
sometime... Hannibal.
Very nice.

NAME: Person_6
They're waiting for ya. They didn't
want to start without her attorney
being present.

NAME: Person_3
PFFFTT! Damn moths! This place could
use a good exterminator.

NAME: Person_3
Can't you get me out of this cage,
Ned? I'm goin' buggy in here.

NAME: Person_1
Judge said no bail. Don't worry.
Just tell the truth, you'll be fine.

NAME: Person_1
Who's gonna handle the interrogation?

NAME: Side_17 1
It's your collar... your bust...
your call... your show... your play...
your move... your wife...

NAME: Person_1
Okay, okay!... I'll handle it.

NAME: Side_17 2
Sorry Mrs. Ravine... there's no makeup
allowed in this building.

NAME: Person_3
What're you gonna do... arrest me
for primping?

NAME: Person_1
Don't give us a tough time. Just
spill it! What were you doing on
that train?

NAME: Person_3
Well...

NAME: Person_1
As your attorney, I must advise you...
you don't have to answer that
question.

NAME: Person_1
Alright, quit playing games with us!
Who put ya up to it? Where'd you get
the gun? What's your link with the

NAME: Person_1
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! That's it! I
will not tolerate this unwarranted
badgering of my client. She'll have
her day in court, gentlemen.

NAME: Person_1
I want to thank you, Mrs. Ravine,
for being so cooperative with these
gentlemen.
Did you get all that down, Laura.
Every word she said?

NAME: Person_4
Yep. Both of 'em.

NAME: Person_2
Yes.

NAME: Person_2
Yes!

NAME: Person_1
NOOOOOOOooooooo!!!

NAME: Person_2
YES! Cappelini pomodoro!

Pasta with tomato sauce. Whatsa matta?
You don't like Italian?

NAME: Person_1
Where's Ned Junior? WHERE IS HE?!

NAME: Person_2
I thought he might like to get out,
so I took him to the amusement park.

NAME: Person_1
You can't just break into my house,
cook my food... borrow my skunk!
Leave me alone. Stay out of my face!
Out of my neighborhood! Out of my

NAME: Person_2
You haven't seen the last of me,
Ned.

NAME: Person_2
I told you.

NAME: Side_16
Lana, Lana, she's the one Shot a bad
guy with a gun Blew that sucker off
a train Some guys are a friggin'
pain YaaaaaAAAAAAAAY Person_3!

NAME: Side_30
Once again, Americans are making a
mockery of their courts, turning a
murder trial into a media circus!
How can justice ever prevail when it
is ridiculed and reviled in such a
heinously revolting manner? This is
Clement Von Franckenstein returning
you to our BBC studios in London for
the latest photographs of Lady Di
naked in the bath.

NAME: Side_8
What a great day for a trial! We
have lots of incandescent lighting,
seventy-two degrees inside... and no
wind!

NAME: Side_6
Oy vay! Oy vay! Superior Court of
Los Angeles is now in session. And
here he is... direct from a triumphant
one-week engagement in Las Vegas
Circuit Court... the honorable...
the venerable... the totally
irrepressible... Judge Harlan Skan-
kyyyyyyy!

NAME: Side_8
Wow... has this defense team been
HOT! Thirty-seven straight victories
this year! Let's go down for the
coin toss.

NAME: Side_7
...the prosecution will prove that
this repulsive and degenerate woman
coldly murdered a decent, law-abiding
citizen...

NAME: Person_1
Objection! Move to strike. Hearsay,
irrelevant, stupid, idiotic, caca-
doody poo-poo...

NAME: Person_8
Sustained.

NAME: Person_1
And can you tell us what this is?

NAME: Person_4
Yes. It's a death threat that Max
Shady FAXED to you on the day he was
released from prison.

NAME: Person_1
A FAX in which he threatened to puree
certain parts of my anatomy in a
blender! I'd like to submit this
into evidence.

NAME: Side_7
Objection! Who cares about the FAX
in this case?

NAME: Person_8
I'll allow it.

NAME: Side_16
U-G-L-Y! You ain't got no alibi!
You're ugly! Yeah, you're ugly! M-A-
M-A! How you think you got that way?
Your Mama! Yeah, your Mama!

NAME: Person_1
And is this the blender you found in
the lavatory of the train?

NAME: Side_10
Yes... it is.

NAME: Person_1
I'd like this marked as evidence.

NAME: Side_8
Awwwww... a bad call by Ravine. Let's
check out the re-play.

NAME: Side_8
Look at THAT! The Bailiff is wide
open! But instead of handing it off,
Ravine goes for the long bomb. Ohhhh!
The pass is wide! A real wobbler!
There's no way! He scrambles, but he
just can't get his hands on it...
And RIGHT THERE!...
...WHAM! That blender is gone!

NAME: Person_4
Ned... did you ever consider that
maybe you don't know women as well
as you think you do?

NAME: Person_1
I'm really worried about this guy.
He could blow our whole case right
out of the water.

NAME: Side_2
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... mutilated monkey
meat... itsy-bitsy birdie feet...
Great green gobs of greasy grimy
gopher guts... and me without a spoon!

NAME: Side_2
That lady paid me two bucks to sing
it to him...!

NAME: Person_8
Recess! Ten minutes!

NAME: Side_7
Gotcha, dork face! Gotcha, gotcha!

NAME: Person_4
No you didn't!

NAME: Person_1
No way! Uh-uh! Missed by a mile!

NAME: Side_6
Recess is over! Let's go... move it,
move it, move it!

NAME: Side_8
There they go... the UCLA Marching
Band! And now... Holy Toledo!... it
looks like the victim's mother...
Helen Shady... is gonna take the
stand! This will be the first
defensive play of the afternoon.

NAME: Person_1
Mrs. Shady... would you tell us about
your son, Max. Was he a... a good
boy?

NAME: Person_7
He was the best. And that's not just
a mother talking. You can ask anybody.

NAME: Person_1
But he got into trouble once in
awhile... like all kids do?

NAME: Person_7
Well, you know, pranks. Little jokes
and things. But he was so cute. I
have pictures!

NAME: Person_7
Here. This is when he set the cat on
fire...
Oh... but the cat deserved it.

NAME: Person_1
And what, uh... what are these...?

NAME: Person_7
Marshmallows. He just loved to toast
marshmallows over a roaring cat.
Burned on the outside... all soft in
the middle.
And right here... this was taken on
the day he left the priesthood to
join the Green Berets.

NAME: Person_1
This is cute.

NAME: Person_7
Oh yes! That was during his Ku Klux
Klan phase. He would take the sheets
right off my bed... cut those little
holes in them. What a stitch he was!

NAME: Person_1
And is this Max... with all the
tools... fixing his bike?

NAME: Person_7
Why that shouldn't even be in there!
It's his rotten little half-brother.
Stinkin' little pecker... he never
was any good...

NAME: Person_7
Oh! I didn't like these neo-Nazi
boys. They were all so fussy and
persnickety about everything. Heil
this and heil that.
Oh look... here's Max with his
chainsaw. He loved to go to the
national park and cut down those
giant old trees. It made him feel so
patriotic. You know, if he hadn't
been such a successful criminal... I
think he would have been a lumberjack.

NAME: Person_7
But now he'll never be anything! Not
since...
...that woman, your wife, pulled the
trigger and put my little Max in his
grave!

NAME: Person_8
Mrs. Shady! Do not POINT your finger
in my courtroom. It's discourteous,
impolite and disrespectful.

NAME: Person_7
Don't you tell me what to do with my
finger! It's been more places than
you've ever dreamed of!

NAME: Person_8
Sit down!

NAME: Person_7
I'll point my finger wherever I want!

NAME: Person_1
Did you encounter the victim... Max
Shady... on board the train?

NAME: Side_9
Yeah. And I told him... "this is the
NO SMOKING car! Would you please put
out your damn cigar!"

NAME: Person_1
And is that the cigar in your ear?

NAME: Side_9
I believe it is.

NAME: Person_1
I'd like the cigar and the head of
this witness entered into evidence.

NAME: Person_1
The defense calls... Lana Ravine!

NAME: Side_6
Do you swear to tell the truth, the
whole truth and nothing but the truth
so help you God?

NAME: Person_3
Do I have to answer that, Harlan?

NAME: Person_8
No, no dear. I'll vouch for her.

NAME: Person_1
Now, Mrs. Ravine... may I call you
Lana?

NAME: Person_3
No. Call me Angel Tits.

NAME: Side_7
I object!

NAME: Person_8
Sustained. Counselor... you will
address Angel Tits as Mrs. Ravine.

NAME: Person_1
Mrs. Ravine... would you please tell
the court... what were you doing on
that train?

NAME: Person_3
I saw Max Shady at the station...
saw him get on board. I knew he'd
made threats to kill you and mutilate
your reproductive organs...

NAME: Person_3
...so I got on the train too... so I
could warn you.

NAME: Person_1
Do you want to have children?

NAME: Person_3
Someday. With the right man.

NAME: Person_1
But you couldn't have children if
my...
...were...
...and, uh...

NAME: Person_3
It would be difficult.

NAME: Person_1
So you followed him, knowing you had
to protect me... your husband...
your best friend... the man you
love... the future father of your
children.

NAME: Person_3
Something like that.

NAME: Person_1
And when you saw that maniac standing
in the vestibule, waiting to pulverize
my pee-pee... you pulled the gun and
fired and fired and FIRED!

NAME: Person_3
And fired and fired and fired and
fired and fired and fired and fired...

NAME: Person_3
...and fired and fired and fired.

NAME: Person_1
The defense rests, your Honor.

NAME: Person_1
How can you convict a courageous
woman who risked everything to save
the life of her beloved husband? A
woman who acted boldly to stop a
demented maniac from doing THIS!...

NAME: Person_1
...pulverizing the private parts of
the man she loves!

NAME: Person_1
Lana Ravine is a loving wife and the
potential mother of my potential
child. I challenge YOU to strike a
blow for motherhood and the American
justice system! Put the "con" back
in the Constitution. Put the "ju"
back in jurisprudence. Put the "can"
back in American. And put the "dom"
back in freedom. Find this woman
INNOCENT!... so we can all go to bed
happy tonight!

NAME: Side_31
The jury's back!

NAME: Person_8
So... has the jury reached a verdict?

NAME: Side_11
Yes we have, your Honor.

NAME: Person_8
How do you find the defendant... on
the count of manslaughter?

NAME: Side_11
Not guilty.

NAME: Person_8
On the count of murder in the first
degree?

NAME: Side_11
Not guilty.

NAME: Person_8
On the Count of Monte Cristo?

NAME: Side_11
Not guilty.

NAME: Person_8
Good. Then on the count of three,
let's all get the hell out of here!
One... two...

NAME: Person_8
Wait... for... it...

NAME: Person_8
Two and a half... THREE!

NAME: Person_3
Well, counselor, looks like you won
another case. Lucky for me.

NAME: Side_32
I told you, Bernard... smoking cigars
is bad for your hearing!

NAME: COURT Side_3
Mrs. Ravine! What can I do for ya?

NAME: Person_3
How much for my gun?

NAME: Person_4
I don't believe it! She just bought
her gun back! The gun she used to
kill a man!

NAME: Person_1
Yeah... the same gun that saved my
life. I'm sure it has sentimental
value.

NAME: Person_5
So... you did it. Ya beat the rap.

NAME: Person_3
No thanks to you.

NAME: Person_5
Hey... I knew he'd spring ya.

NAME: Person_3
You didn't lift a finger, Frank. You
let me take all the heat.

NAME: Person_5
Heeeee-eeey... what could I do?

NAME: Person_3
You were gonna let me rot in the
slammer... never say a thing.

NAME: Person_5
Look... you're out... free. Now we're
together. That's what counts. We can
try again! Forget triple indemnity.
We'll whack him and split three mil.

NAME: Person_3
I'm not splitting anything, Frank.
And you know too much.

NAME: Person_5
Come on, Lana. You're not gonna shoot
me.

NAME: Person_3
You're right.
Maybe I'll just screw you to death.

NAME: Person_5
Now you're talkin' baby.

NAME: Side_34
Watch your step, guys. There's a lot
of blood.

NAME: Side_17
Looks like a suicide. We found a
note.

NAME: Side_17
It was stuck up his nose.

NAME: Person_6
"I can't take it anymore. I'm a
mediocre mechanic... and a lousy
lover."

NAME: Person_1
He's sure got that right.

NAME: Person_1
The "mechanic" part, I mean.

NAME: Person_1
I don't know why, Arch, but I just
can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't
suicide.

NAME: Person_3
Oh... uh, Ned... This is Lola, um...

NAME: Person_1
Um? She told you her name was Um?
And what other lies did she tell
you? I've never seen this woman in
my life! Never followed her home!
Never had sex with her in the
refrigerator! It's all a sick
fantasy... and I deny everything!

NAME: Person_1
When will women like you learn, you
can't tear apart a perfectly good
marriage with your vicious lies...
Miss UMMMM!

NAME: Person_2
Actually... it's Smith. Lola Smith.
I sell vacuum cleaners, Mr. Ravine.
The big powerful kind that suck up
everything in sight. I was just
telling your wife, if she wants to
get rid of all her dirt, she has to
be willing to pay the price.

NAME: Person_2
Let me know what you decide, Mrs.
Ravine. I'm sure we can work out a
convenient "payment" plan. A pleasure
meeting you... Ned.

NAME: Person_3
I... hate... SALESMEN!

NAME: Person_1
I know it's been a tough ordeal...
with the trial and everything. Tell
you what... let's take a trip.

NAME: Person_3
A trip?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Just the two of us.

NAME: Person_3
I like that. Just you and me... all
alone. I'll start packing.

NAME: Person_1
Great. Listen... I got something to
take care of. I'll be back in awhile.

NAME: Person_2
Who is it?

NAME: Person_1
I just want to talk.

NAME: Person_2
Why didn't you say so?

NAME: Person_2
Would you like a drink?

NAME: Person_1
No thanks. I'm driving.

NAME: Person_2
Then let's get to the point!

NAME: Person_2
So what's your problem, tough guy?

NAME: Person_1
Stay away from my life, my wife, my
home and my pets! I'm taking Lana on
a vacation and when I come back, I
don't ever want to see your face
again!

NAME: Person_2
A VACATION! She doesn't deserve a
VACATION! She's a brat! A bad girl!
She always was and always will be!

NAME: Person_1
What are you talking about? You don't
know anything about Lana?

NAME: Person_2
I know EVERYTHING!

NAME: Person_1
How do you know her? Who is she to
you? TELL ME!

NAME: Person_1
Who is she!

NAME: Person_2
She's your wife!

NAME: Person_1
Who is she!?

NAME: Person_2
She's my sister!

NAME: Person_1
Liar! Who is she?

NAME: Person_2
She's your wife!

NAME: Person_2
She's my sister!

NAME: Person_2
She's your wife... AND my sister!

NAME: Person_2
She was spoiled rotten! She stole
everything I ever had. Everything!
Including him.

NAME: Person_1
Him? Who, him?

NAME: Person_2
Dwayne. The boy's gym teacher. He
was older. So mature... so strong.
He smelled like dirty sweat socks
and old basketballs. And he was all
mine. For awhile.
But Lana wasn't satisfied with her
own things. She had to have mine
too. She took it all... my makeup,
my sweaters, my shoes, my underwear...

NAME: Person_1
You wore the same clothes?

NAME: Person_2
We were identical twins.

NAME: Person_1
What're you talking about? You two
don't look anything alike.

NAME: Person_2
Not anymore. One day I caught her
stealing my lavender eye shadow and
she smashed my face in with a shovel.
I had fifty-three operations. When
the doctors were finished with me...
I looked like THIS! I'm ugly. UGLY!

NAME: Person_1
You're beautiful.

NAME: Person_2
Don't lie to me.

NAME: Person_1
They did a terrific job!

NAME: Person_2
I look in the mirror. I can SEE!

NAME: Person_1
But... you're gorgeous!

NAME: Person_2
Tell that to Dwayne. When he saw my
face, he left me for HER... because
she looked more like me than I did!
First she stole my looks... then she
stole the only man who ever loved
me!

NAME: Person_2
But I found a way to get even. The
best revenge possible. Destroy her
marriage!

NAME: Person_1
That's why you did all this? Seduced
me... harrassed me... the tape...
the flowers... the phone calls...

NAME: Person_2
You been hangin' out with Dick Tracy,
haven't ya?

NAME: Person_1
It won't work. Lana loves me.

NAME: Person_2
It doesn't matter. I'm blackmailing
her for everything she's worth. She
murdered that greasy auto mechanic.
I saw her do it.

NAME: Person_1
Lana killed Frank Kelbo?

NAME: Person_2
Kelbo! His name was Kelbo?

NAME: Person_1
Yeah. Why? Did he burn you on car
repairs too?

NAME: Person_2
Dwayne's name was Kelbo. He had a
son. Frankie Kelbo.

NAME: Person_1
Lana?

NAME: Person_4
Ned! I'm glad you're here. I have so
much to tell you.

NAME: Person_1
Come on in. I'll make some tea. Grab
a chair.

NAME: Person_4
Thanks... I brought my own.

NAME: Person_1
So... what have you got?

NAME: Person_4
A lottery ticket and a laundry
receipt.
I found them in the pocket of that
suit you wore the night you were
working under cover with a client.

NAME: Person_4
You remember that night, don't ya
Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts
with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L-
O... L-A. Lola.

NAME: Person_4
Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's
mind works.

NAME: Person_1
How about Ovaltine?

NAME: Person_4
Fine. Then I remembered you told me
some guy named Frank had been working
on your wife's car for two months.
You with me so far?

NAME: Person_1
I'm way ahead of you.

NAME: Person_4
Well back it up. You probably took a
wrong turn. Remember your insurance
policy... the one we couldn't find?
I started thinking, who else had
access to it beside you and me? The
answer came up... Lana. And since
she's a woman, it's probably hidden
right here.

NAME: Person_1
So that's where she hid the Oreos.

NAME: Person_4
Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your
life when she shot Max Shady. She
and Frank were plotting to kill you
and collect on your insurance policy.
But she shot the wrong guy.

NAME: Person_1
That's the craziest thing I ever
heard.

NAME: Person_4
Don't you see... Frank was going to
let her take the fall. So she murdered
him and tried to make it look like
suicide.
That's when I realized there was a
connection between Lola and Lana...

NAME: Person_1
Yeah... they're sisters. Twin sisters.

NAME: Person_4
Well, hang on to your jock strap,
Ned. There's more.

NAME: Person_4
Not only is Frank's father Dwayne
Kelbo, notoriously amorous gym teacher
and Lola Cain's former lover...
Frank's mother is Helen Shady. Max
and Frank are half-brothers who never
met.

NAME: Person_4
Your lovely wife, Lana, murdered
both of Helen Shady's sons.

NAME: Person_1
This is so unbelievable.

NAME: Person_4
And you haven't even heard my story.

NAME: Person_4
He turned into a monster. And that's
when I left him. I just couldn't...

NAME: Person_1
That damn faucet keeps turning on
all by itself. I'll go check it.

NAME: Person_4
Okay. I'll make the Ovaltine.

NAME: Side_35
I'm sittin' in for Dizzy. He had a
gig tonight.

NAME: Person_4'S HUSBAND
Forget something, sweetheart?

NAME: Person_4'S HUSBAND
You forgot to flush, darling.

NAME: Person_2
What're you gonna do, Ned? Blow me
away?

NAME: Person_4
I never forget anything... honey.

NAME: Person_4
Those are MY panties!

NAME: Person_4
Oh Ned!

NAME: Person_1
You were right... there's a million
things I don't know about women.
Maybe you can teach me a few hundred.

NAME: Person_1
Hell... I had too many careers anyway.

NAME: Person_4
Oh Ned, I love you. I always loved
you!

NAME: Person_4
Got 'em!

NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_4
I said... I GOT 'EM!

NAME: Person_4
NAME: Person_1
NAME: Person_4
Okay. But I want to have kids.

NAME: Person_1
Great.

NAME: Person_1
...understand women... give birth...
and program a VCR. And giving birth
is the easy one.

NAME: Person_4
Ned...

NAME: Person_1
Yeah, Laura?

NAME: Person_4
Knock off the chatter, will ya?

NAME: Person_4
We won't need you anymore.

NAME: Person_4
We can make our own music.
